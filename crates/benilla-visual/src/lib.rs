//! Perceptual image-diff metrics for the Phase-5 visual A/B render harness (decision 0008).
//!
//! The harness captures deterministic screenshots of benilla (`$WOW_CAPTURE`, see the `capture` module
//! in the `benilla` crate) and diffs them. This crate is the pure-math half: given two equally-sized

//!
//! Three uses, one tool: (1) **self-regression** — capture baselines on the current pipeline, then diff
//! every linear-HDR rework step against them so a machine catches a regression before the director's
//! eye; (2) **determinism check** — diffing two captures of the same scenario must come out ≈0, which is
//! what makes (1) trustworthy; (3) **flicker** ([`envelope`]) — the same arithmetic over *time* instead
//! of over versions: a burst of adjacent frames from a parked camera (`WOW_LIVE_SHOT_COUNT`), collapsed
//! to where the picture would not hold still.
