//! Inbound chat — `SMSG_MESSAGECHAT` (VERIFIED vmangos `ChatHandler::BuildChatPacket`,
//! `Chat/Chat.cpp:2542-2599`, all `SUPPORTED_CLIENT_BUILD` bands included for 5875): `u8 type`, `u32
//! language`, a **per-type sender prefix**, then `u32 len` (includes the NUL) + the text + `u8
//! chatTag`. This is how everything textual reaches the client — player say/yell/whisper, NPC
//! lines, channels, and the **system messages** GM dot-commands answer with (type `0x0A`), which
//! is what makes command feedback visible to the probe and the chat UI.
//!
//! Also owns the handful of small chat-adjacent SMSG bodies that aren't their own subsystem:
//! `SMSG_CHAT_PLAYER_NOT_FOUND`, `SMSG_CHAT_WRONG_FACTION`, `SMSG_PLAYED_TIME`, and `MSG_RANDOM_ROLL`'s
//! server→client broadcast shape. The channel subsystem (join/leave/list/moderation +
//! `SMSG_CHANNEL_NOTIFY`/`_LIST`) is big enough to own its own module: [`super::channel`].
