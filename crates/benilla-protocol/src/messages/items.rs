//! economy, every requirement gate (level/skill/spell/honor rank/city rank/reputation,
//! allowable class/race), stacking (maxCount/stackable/containerSlots), the full 10-slot stat
//! block, all 5 damage blocks (block 0 also mirrors into the legacy `dmg_min`/`dmg_max`/`dmg_type`
//! fields existing consumers already key on), armor plus the 6-wide resistance run, ranged data,
//! all 5 spell-trigger slots (the first ON_USE slot still surfaces separately as `use_spell` — the
