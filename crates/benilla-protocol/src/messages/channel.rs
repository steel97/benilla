//! The channel subsystem — join/leave/list/moderation (opcodes 151-168, VERIFIED vmangos
//! `Server/Protocol/Opcodes_1_12_1.h:154-171`) plus the two server notification packets:
//! `SMSG_CHANNEL_NOTIFY` (a notice byte + channel name + a per-notice tail — [`read_channel_notify`],
//! VERIFIED vmangos `Chat/Channel.cpp:804-1008` against the enum in `Chat/Channel.h:35-71`) and
//! `SMSG_CHANNEL_LIST` (the member roster — [`read_channel_list`], VERIFIED
//! `Chat/Channel.cpp:497-557`). CMSG bodies are VERIFIED against `Server/Packets/Channel.h`/`.cpp`
//! (every `ReadFromWorldPacket` there): every moderation command reads `cstring channelName [+
//! cstring playerName]` — the client body builders in [`super::client`] all funnel through
//! [`super::client::cstrings_body`] for that shared shape.
