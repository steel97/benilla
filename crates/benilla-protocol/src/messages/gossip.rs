//! Gossip + NPC-text messages — the "right-click a friendly NPC → dialog" family (opcodes 379-384,
//! vmangos `Opcodes_1_12_1.h`, VERIFIED). Bodies from vmangos `Npc.{h,cpp}` + the hand-serialized
//! `GossipDef.cpp`. Vendor bodies live beside this in [`super::vendor`] — a different wire family
//! (`CMSG_LIST_INVENTORY`/buy/sell) that a gossip option can lead into but doesn't share a shape with.
//! Quest-giver flows (`SMSG_QUESTGIVER_*`) are a separate, out-of-scope arc; the quest-option block
//! riding inside `SMSG_GOSSIP_MESSAGE` is parsed here only to stay byte-aligned.

///   excluded from the draw outright; if that empties the record, the reference takes its error path
///   and shows no greeting at all, rather than reading the other gender's line.
