//! `benilla-protocol` — WoW 1.12.1 (build 5875) auth + world wire protocol.
//!
//! Auth/SRP6 and the world header crypto come from `benilla-srp`; message (de)serialization is
//! in-repo ([`auth`] for the realmd login protocol, [`world`]/[`events`] for the world protocol) —
//! decision 0021. 1.12.1 uses **login protocol version 3**. This crate owns the session logic; the
//! async↔ECS bridge lives in `benilla`. Phase 3: SRP6 logon + realm
//! list.
