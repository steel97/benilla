//! The cast family's `WorldWriter` sends — the three `CMSG_CAST_SPELL` shapes (a unit or self, a
//! GameObject, an item), plus the three cancels a cast can need: the in-flight cast, the channel,
//! and the aura it left behind. Bodies in [`crate::messages::spells`], whose scope this mirrors;
//! the two spell-id cancels are a bare `u32` written inline. Split out of `writer/mod.rs`
//! (decision 0636), narrowed to the cast itself by decision 0640.
//!
//! 0636 kept auto-attack, the action bar and the talent spend here on the grounds that all of them
//! are "the ability system's wire". That was the weakest grouping in it, and once 0640 split
//! `messages/spells.rs` the mirror both allowed and recommended the finer cut: they are now
//! [`super::attack`], [`super::action_bar`] and [`super::progression`].
//!
//! The aura cancel stays because the wire says it belongs to the spell, not to the aura:
//! `CMSG_CANCEL_AURA` is addressed **by spell id, not by aura slot**.
