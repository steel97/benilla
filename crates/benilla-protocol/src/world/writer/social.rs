//! The social family's `WorldWriter` sends — friends, ignores, and `/who` (decision 0668).
//!
//! Note the asymmetry the wire imposes and the UI has to live with: you **add** by name and
//! **remove** by guid (`CMSG_ADD_FRIEND` takes a cstring, `CMSG_DEL_FRIEND` a guid). That is not
//! an inconsistency to paper over — it is why the client keeps both lists keyed by guid and
//! resolves display names through the name cache (see [`crate::messages::social`]'s module doc).
//! A "remove Bob" verb therefore has to find Bob's guid in the list *before* it can send anything.
