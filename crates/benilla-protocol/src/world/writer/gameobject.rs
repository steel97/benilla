//! The GameObject family's `WorldWriter` sends — the single player-facing USE verb and the

//!
//! Two verbs is the whole family by design (decision 0236): the client does not know or care what
//! kind of GameObject it just clicked — one `CMSG_GAMEOBJ_USE` goes out and the *server* fans it
//! out by GO type. Everything the client needs to draw the thing and pick its cursor comes from the
//! template query.
