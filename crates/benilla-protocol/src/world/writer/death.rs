//! The death/corpse-run family's `WorldWriter` sends — release the spirit, find the corpse,
//! reclaim it, self-resurrect off a soulstone, or take the spirit healer's res; plus the answer
//! to someone else's res offer.
//! Bodies in [`crate::messages`]'s `reclaim_corpse`/`spirit_healer_activate`/`resurrect_response`
//! builders (`repop_request`, `corpse_query` and `self_res` are bodyless). Split out of
//! `writer/mod.rs` (decision 0636), mirroring [`crate::messages::death`].
//!
//! Every one of these is server-gated on a death state the client only *believes* it is in
//! (ghost/unreleased/delay-elapsed/in-range), so a refusal is normal and is not always a packet —
//! the confirmations arrive as ordinary descriptor deltas.
