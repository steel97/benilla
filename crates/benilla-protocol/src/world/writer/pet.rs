//! The pet's `WorldWriter` sends — mirroring [`crate::messages::pet`] (decisions 0982, 0988, 1066).
//!
//! Six verbs, and the thing to know about the bar's four is that **no reply packet answers any of
//! them**. The first three are intents the client has already applied to its own state before sending
//! (wow-re §10.1/§10.2: the reaction, command and autocast paths all write `[0xb71468]` or the
//! slot word and fire `PET_BAR_UPDATE` *before* the packet leaves). The bar's contents change only
//! when a fresh `SMSG_PET_SPELLS` arrives — a summon, a swap, a learned spell — never as a reply
//! to one of these.
//!
//! [`WorldWriter::pet_cancel_aura`] is the exception worth naming: it too gets no reply, but it is
//! the one verb the client does *not* pre-apply, because what it changes is the pet's own
//! descriptor. The aura leaves in a `UNIT_FIELD_AURA` delta, and the slot's icon follows from
//! that — so the round trip is visible, just not as an answer.
//!
//! The menu's two ([`WorldWriter::pet_abandon`], [`WorldWriter::pet_rename`]) invert that: neither
//! is pre-applied, because what each asks for is not a UI state the server ignores but a change to
//! the world that it may refuse — and the answer arrives as the pet leaving, or as a bumped name
//! timestamp in its descriptor.
//!
//! Every one carries the pet's guid: the server re-checks ownership on each
//! (`PetHandler.cpp`'s `GetCharmerOrOwnerGuid` gate) and silently drops anything naming a unit we
//! don't control.
