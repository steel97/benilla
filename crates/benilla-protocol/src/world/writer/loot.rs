//! The loot window's `WorldWriter` sends — open, take a row, take the coin pile, close, and vote
//! in a group roll. Bodies in [`crate::messages::loot`], whose scope this mirrors. Split out of
//! `writer/mod.rs` (decision 0636).
//!
//! Two addressing quirks worth keeping together: [`WorldWriter::loot_release`] passes a guid the
//! server *ignores* (it releases whatever loot guid it has stored for us), and
//! [`WorldWriter::loot_roll`] is addressed by the `(looted_target, item_slot)` pair the roll was
//! opened with — never by the client-internal `rollID` the reference UI keys its frames on.
