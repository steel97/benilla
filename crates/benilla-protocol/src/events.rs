//! Decoded session events — the codec's typed output.

//! `benilla-protocol` decodes the world stream into a flat list of [`SessionEvent`]s; the running
//! world model (which entities exist, where they are, the clock) is the **app's** job (the ECS), not
//! the codec's. One `SMSG_(COMPRESSED_)UPDATE_OBJECT` fans out into many create/move/remove events; a
//! `SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE` becomes a path the app turns into a spline; the clock packet becomes a time
//! sample the app advances. Only primitives + the coarse [`EntityKind`] classification cross this
