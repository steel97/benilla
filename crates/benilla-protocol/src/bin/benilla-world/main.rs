//! `benilla-world` — Phase 4 CLI: log in to realmd, connect to the world server (`mangosd`), enter the
//! world as a character, and stream/tally the object updates the server pushes.
//!
//! Example: `cargo run -p benilla-protocol --bin benilla-world -- one pone localhost`
//!
//! If the account has no character yet, one is created (`--create <name>`, Human Warrior) so
//! `CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN` has something to log in. The realmd host is a positional arg; the world server
//! address defaults to whatever the realm list advertises (override with `--world`).
