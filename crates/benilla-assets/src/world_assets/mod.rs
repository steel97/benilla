//! materials.
//!
//! It lives here rather than in the client because it is a layer *under* both sides, and 1164
//! measured how far under: `WorldAssets` alone is named by 63 files, `LockRecover` by 43 and
//! `AssetSet` by 37, and they serve UI sprites, portraits and the minimap mask exactly as much as
//! they serve terrain. Nothing in here reads game state — it knows what pixel shape something
//! wants, not what a unit frame *is*.
//!
//! What stayed up in the client is the 115-line plugin shell that drives it: opening the chain at
//! startup needs the shared light buffer, evicting on a map change needs the world-map message, and
//! the residency sweep needs the art-scope instrument. Those three are the only upward reaches the
//! module ever had (decision 1164) — the data core below has none.
//!
//! Deduping by path/material means each unique BLP is decoded + uploaded once, and submeshes sharing
//! a texture+blend share a material handle — which is what lets Bevy batch draws.
