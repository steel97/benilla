//! WMO → model asset loader.
//!
//! A WMO (building) is a **root** file plus N **group** files (`<stem>_NNN.wmo`). The loader reads the
//! root from the [`Reader`], then reads each group via [`LoadContext::read_asset_bytes`] (raw bytes,
//! recorded as a dependency — *not* `load()`, which would recurse back into this loader), building one
//! [`ModelSubmesh`] per group render batch with its texture resolved against the root's material
//! tables.
//!
//! Same app-independent shape as the M2 loader (geometry + texture handles + metadata; meshes are
//! built paced app-side — decision 0834 — and materials at spawn). WMOs don't size-fade, so there
//! are no bounds.
