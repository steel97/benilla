//! The frame's **texture filter policy** — one process-global pair, exactly as the reference holds
//! it, and the divergence that pair was hiding.
//!
//! ## What the reference actually does
//!
//! The real 1.12.1 client does not let a texture choose how it is filtered. Every
//! `TextureCreate` (`0x449d90`) runs the caller's request through **`0x449ae0`** with a force flag
//! that is a literal `1` at every observed call site, and `0x449ae0` **overwrites** it from two
//! globals: filter bits 0-2 from `[0x835250]`, aniso bits 9-13 from
//! `(mode == 5 ? [0x835254] : 1)`. Their static `.data` values are **`[0x835250] = 3`** and
//! **`[0x835254] = 1`**, and a full image-wide caller census of their only two writers
//! (`0x449ac0` / `0x449ad0`) finds exactly three call sites, all inside the CVar callbacks below.
//! WMO, M2/character and terrain textures all share the one policy; there is no per-draw filter
//! override anywhere. (wow-re `system/models/scratch/wmo-texture-sampling.md` §2, VERIFIED off
//! `0x449ae0`/`0x59f170`/`0x58a980`/`0x6c4c20` + the registration block `0x6885b0`-`0x688840`.)
//!
//! Mode 3 — the static `.data` value — is `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST` / `GL_LINEAR`: bilinear with
//! nearest-mip select, anisotropy off. Two CVars move it, and only upward:
//!
//! - **`trilinear`** (reg `0x688608`, registered default `"0"`) — nonzero sets mode 4,
//!   `GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR`.
//! - **`anisotropic`** (reg `0x6887d0`, registered default **`"1"`**) — a value >1 sets mode 5
//!   (trilinear *plus* real aniso N, clamped to the device cap) and **outranks** `trilinear`.
//!
//! ## …and why the registrar's string is not what the client renders at
//!
//! **`hwDetect` overwrites it before the first frame.** `hwDetect` registers `"1"`, and
//! `DetectHardware 0x641260` → `0x639a60` then `CVar::Set`s **sixteen** video CVars from the
//! matched `VideoHardware.dbc` row, self-clears to `"0"`, and persists — so the registrar's string
//! is only ever what an install renders at if the hardware table has nothing to say.
//!
//! It always has something to say. Every GPU this client runs on now is unlisted in a 2004 table,
//! so the row comes from the **fallback** scan (`0x641610`, from record index 1, vendor `0xFFFF`
//! against a D3D9 capability tier from `CGxDevice::DeviceAdapterInfer 0x58bc90`), whose reachable
//! set is exactly three rows: **168** (tier 0), **169** (tier 1), **170** (tier 2). Tier 2 needs
//! HW T&L, >2 simultaneous textures and PS ≥ 1.1 — which any D3D9 part saturates.
//!
//! **`trilinear` is 1 on rows 169 and 170, at both CPU tiers, and carries no CPU bias term.** So
//! the mode a real machine gets from a virgin install is **4**, not 3, and that is what benilla
//! registers (decision 1645, superseding 1642's `"0"`). Measured, not only derived: the reference
//! client's own `WoW/Logs/gx.log` on the director's machine reads `VID: 106b` (unlisted) →
//! `DeviceAdapterInfer … DID: 2` → `DetectHardware(): videoID: 170`.
//!
//! **`anisotropic` is NOT one of the sixteen** (verified by scanning `[0x639a60, 0x639b80)`:
//! sixteen record-pointer reads, `0xc7f2e4` absent). It keeps its registered `"1"` on every path,
//! so anisotropy really is off out of the box — 1642's load-bearing half stands.
//!
//! ## One correction to how wide the policy reaches
//!
//! 1642 said there is no per-texture filter override anywhere in the reference. That is **too
//! broad**. `applyGlobal` is a per-*call* argument to `0x449ae0`, and while terrain (`0x6c4c77`),
//! WMO (the same wrapper `0x6c4c20`) and M2 (`0x71da72`) all pass `1` — which is what this module
//! needs and is confirmed — six subsystems pass `0` and keep their own mode: weather sprites
//! (hard-coded mode 4), the minimap, glue/loading, Lua texture widgets and the sky. None of them
//! is a lane this module builds a sampler for, so the code is right; the claim was not.
//!
//! ## The divergence this module closes
//!
//! benilla hardcoded `mipmap_filter: Linear` + `anisotropy_clamp: 8` at every sampler it built —
//! mode 5 at aniso 8, on every terrain layer array, model albedo, WMO albedo and static-GX array
//! in the game, with no CVar and no way to turn it off. That is the *maximum* of what the
//! reference will do on request, shipped as the thing it does before anybody asks.
//!
//! It is [`decisions/1624`]'s mistake one sampler over, and it was made the same way. `farclip`
//! shipped at 777 because that was "what most players' `Config.wtf` had"; the filtering shipped at
//! trilinear+aniso because an apitrace of the repo's reference install showed trilinear+aniso16 —
//! and that install's `Config.wtf` carries `SET anisotropic "16"`. Both read a *set* value as a
//! *registered* one. Verifying that a mechanism exists is not verifying that it is the default.
//!
//! The cost is not incidental. Mode 3 takes one bilinear tap per sample. Mode 5 at aniso 8 takes up
//! to **sixteen** — eight along the anisotropy axis, doubled by the trilinear mip blend — and the
//! worst case for the anisotropy axis is a tiling surface at a grazing angle, which is what ground
//! is from a third-person camera. On the GPU-bound Steam Deck frame behind 1624 (B329) the texture
//! path is where the frame already lives.
//!
//! ## Why a process global here too
//!
//! Not imitation: the same constraint the reference had. A sampler is baked into the [`Image`]
//! asset at load time, and the lanes that build one are an async `AssetLoader` with no world
//! access ([`crate::blp`]) and ordinary systems ([`crate::world_assets`], `static_gx`) — neither
//! can read the other's resource. This is exactly the shape [`crate::gpu_blp`]'s `bc_supported`
//! already has, for exactly the same reason.
//!
//! **Latched, like `gxMultisample`** (decision 1629): read once at boot and never again, because a
//! sampler already baked into an uploaded texture cannot be changed without rebuilding it — which
//! is also why the reference's own UI says "enabled upon restart". The CVar holds the pending
//! value; the textures keep what they were born with.
