//! The shared debug-trace sink behind `WOW_MOVE_TRACE=<path>`: one file, one clock, written by
//! the player mover's frame lines (`benilla::player`'s `move_trace`), its outbound wire lines
//! (`snd`), the anim driver's event lines (`benilla::creature_anim`), and the remote-replay lines
//! (`rly`/`run`, `benilla::net::motion`) — so the layers interleave on a common timeline and a feel
//! report ("it snaps when I land") can be read across all of them. Each file opens with a
//! `# t0=<unix epoch>` header so **two clients' traces align with each other**, which is what a
//! sender-vs-observer question needs. Costs one `OnceLock` read per call when the env var is unset.
//!
//! **It lives down here, below both sides of decision 1160's line, because both sides write to it**
//! — the engine's billboard/zfill/particle traces and the game's mover and wire traces share one
//! file and one clock, which is the whole point of it. An instrument at the *top* of the stack
//! could not be called by the engine at all; a leaf with no dependencies can be called by
//! everything. It carries no domain knowledge: a tag, a message, a mutex and a file.
//!
//! **`WOW_MOVE_TRACE_TAGS="move,snd,in"` narrows it to those tags** (unset = everything). This is
//! not tidiness: every line is an unbuffered `write` under one global mutex on the main thread, so a
//! busy tag distorts the run it is meant to measure. A 600-yd fall probe (decision 0880) wrote
//! ~4,200 lines/s, nearly all of them `card`, and the `move` line's own `t=` then carried whatever
//! the queue ahead of it cost — frames read back as 0.011 s with 2.86 yd of travel, or 0.040 s with
//! 0.96 yd, against a physics integration that was exact. A trace whose clock cannot be trusted for
//! per-frame timing is half an instrument; filtering to the tags the question needs gives it back.
