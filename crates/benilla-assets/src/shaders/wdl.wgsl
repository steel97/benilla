// WDL distant-terrain shader — the coarse horizon hills the reference draws beyond the streamed
// detailed tiles (docs/knowledge/terrain.md "WDL"). Both stages custom.
//
// The reference draws WDL UNLIT + UNTEXTURED with white vertex diffuse, then fogs it with the SAME
// scene fog as terrain/M2/WMO (VERIFIED apitrace WoW.8: prog 96 vertex-white, fog.color matching the
// zone haze). So the colour is entirely the fog: past `fog_end` it's pure haze, and the visible result
// is fog-coloured hill silhouettes occluding the (un-fogged) sky. Fog math + gamma handling mirror
// terrain.wgsl exactly: planar eye-Z, GL_LINEAR, gamma space; the output is raw gamma — the buffer
// holds bytes and the frame's one decode lives in the FFXGlow combine (GAMMA LANE, 0161).
//
// ## The far band is a BACKDROP, not the far half of a plane partition (decision 0684)
//
// The reference's far-band pass (`CWorldScene` drain `0x6841a0`, wow-re `terrain.md` + `rf35-render-list`)
// does NOT share a clip plane with the detailed world. It draws the coarse hulls under its own
// projection — `SetPerspective(fov, aspect, near = farclip − 33.0, far = horizonfarclip)`, byte-read at
// the two call sites `0x6842f2` (render) / `0x68317f` (the far walk's cull frustum), the `33.0` at
// `[0x8101b0]`, the horizon far from the runtime box `[0xc7b49c]` — into a **compressed depth range
// `[0.955, 0.96]`** (`[0x80febc]=0.96`, `[0x80fec4]=0.005`), i.e. squashed into the back half-percent of
// the depth buffer so it can never occlude anything the detailed world drew. Two properties fall out,
// and BOTH are load-bearing:
//
//   * the band **overlaps** the detailed world by 33 yd (≈ one WDL outer cell, spacing 33.333) — so a
//     coarse hull that crosses back inside the wall is still drawn, and no hole can open at the seam;
//   * it is **depth-pushed**, never near-clipped at the wall — so that overlap cannot poke through the
//     fine terrain, and nothing coarse near the camera can paint over the sky (its near plane stops it).
//
// We used to partition instead: terrain discarded past `farclip`, WDL discarded before it, sharing one
// plane with zero overlap. Two different surfaces cannot partition cleanly at one plane — wherever a ray
// grazed the coarse hull entirely INSIDE the wall while the fine mesh it approximates lay beyond it (a
// ridge crest, exactly), both passes discarded and the sky showed through as a band at the horizon
// (the director's "in-between area at the clip barrier", Weazel's Crater, 2026-07-26).
//
// Our depth buffer is Bevy's infinite REVERSE-Z (`perspective_infinite_reverse_rh`: depth = near/eye_z,
// 0 = infinitely far, and never exactly 0 for finite geometry), so the reference's `[0.955, 0.96]`
// window becomes a clamp rather than a `glDepthRange`: every detailed-world fragment lives at
// `depth ≥ near/farclip` (it is discarded past the wall), so clamping WDL just below that value puts the
// whole band behind the world by construction, while leaving it in front of the sky's forced `0.0`
// (`sky_order.rs`, "The depth law"). Order of the three backdrop tiers, all decided by depth and nothing
// else: sky (0.0) → WDL band → detailed world.
