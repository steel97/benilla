//! M2 → model asset loader.
//!
//! Decodes a WoW M2 (`*.m2`) into an [`M2Model`]: one [`ModelSubmesh`] per render batch, each
//! carrying the batch's **decoded geometry** plus its texture as a `Handle<Image>` **dependency**
//! (through the `mpq://` source). **The loader ships no meshes** (decision 0834, the model-lane
//! twin of 0832's terrain rule): a labeled mesh sub-asset lands the whole model's render form in
//! ONE frame — the city first-contact spike — so the app builds each batch's `Mesh` paced at the
//! spawn side (`benilla`'s `model_forms`, via [`submesh_to_static_mesh`](crate::submesh_to_static_mesh)
//! / [`submesh_to_skinned_mesh`](crate::submesh_to_skinned_mesh)).
//!
//! Deliberately app-independent: ships **geometry + texture handles + metadata only**, not materials
//! (the WoW lighting material is an app concern built at spawn) — so this asset is shared verbatim by
//! doodads, creatures, GameObjects, and the star model. Creature **skin variations** (`Monster1/2/3`)
//! are blank here (no `skins` passed) and resolved at the spawn site from `CreatureDisplayInfo`; this
//! loads the model's own embedded (hardcoded) textures.
//!
//! References use `.mdx`/`.mdl`, but the physical archive file is `.m2`; callers map the extension when
//! forming the `mpq://…m2` load path (the loader registers for `m2`).
