//! The client's **one** `rand()` stream — the MSVC-CRT LCG at `0x7400e5`.
//!
//! **It lives down here, below both sides of decision 1160's line, because both sides draw from
//! it** — `trace`'s placement argument, verbatim, for the same reason. The engine's placed-doodad
//! host and the game's creature, GameObject and portrait-booth arms all roll a variation off this
//! sequence, and in the reference they roll it off the *same cell*: `rand` reads and rewrites
//! `[ptd+0x14]`, one per thread, and every animation arm in the client runs on the primary thread
//! (`_initterm` is pre-`WinMain`; the frame loop is inline, not spawned — wow-re
//! `net/scratch/crt-rand-stream-seeding.md` §4). A leaf with no dependencies can be reached by
//! everything; an owner at the top of the stack cannot be reached by the engine at all.
//!
//! **Why one stream and not one per consumer** (decision 0768, and 2301 which found the drift):
//! a shared sequence is what de-syncs a stand of identical props. Not a per-placement seed — just
//! consecutive draws. benilla had four independent streams for a while, three of them seeded 0
//! against the fourth's 1, while all four docstrings claimed to be this one; interleaving is the
//! whole mechanism, so splitting it is not a harmless refactor.
//!
//! **The seed is the reference's, and it is not 1.** `1` is real — the CRT's per-thread default at
//! `_initptd 0x40aca8`, which is what [`AnimRng::default`] returns — but the client overwrites it
//! during CRT static initialization, before `WinMain`: `_initterm` slot **3691** (`.data
//! 0x82a9ac` → the `_dynamic_initializer_for_*` trampoline `0x5b7ff0` → `0x5b8000`) calls
//! `0x5d1c70`, which calls `srand(GetTickCount())` at `0x5d1c8b`. So the reference's variation
//! sequence differs on every run, and [`AnimRng::seed_for_session`] is where benilla says the same
//! thing. Byte-VERIFIED by a wow-re §5 round; recorded in
//! `net/scratch/crt-rand-stream-seeding.md`.
//!
//! **Sequence parity with the reference is not achievable and is not the goal.** Where the stream
//! stands at any given arm depends on every intervening draw — the noise table `Model2::Initialize`
//! builds, the sky LUT, every `CParticleEmitter2` constructor, and FrameXML's own `random()` (bound
//! as a bare global by the embedded `compat.lua`, and called in ordinary play). What benilla
//! reproduces is the *structure*: one stream, wall-clock seeded, shared, non-repeating across runs.
