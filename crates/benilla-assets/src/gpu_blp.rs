//! Where a BLP's stored form meets the GPU: **can we hand the blocks over untouched?**
//!
//! WoW ships almost all world art as S3TC (DXT1/DXT3/DXT5) blocks, and the reference client uploads
//! those blocks verbatim — `glCompressedTexImage2DARB`, with the software DXT decoder existing only
//! as a 16-bit-device fallback (wow-re `system/image/image.md`: *"raw passthrough — device eats
//! DXT"*, and `system/models/scratch/wmo-texture-sampling.md` for the per-level upload formats).
//! benilla used to decode every one of them to `Rgba8Unorm` on the CPU and upload that: **8x the
//! bytes of DXT1, 4x of DXT3/DXT5**, on the whole resident working set and on every texture fetch
//! that misses the cache. On a bandwidth-starved integrated GPU that is the frame's dominant cost,
//! and it is the divergence Liho's Steam Deck reading exposed (decision 1626).
//!
//! Two things have to be true before the blocks can go straight over, and this module owns both:
//!
//! 1. **The device must accept BC.** [`bc_supported`] is a process-wide fact published once from
//!    the render device (see [`publish_bc_support`]). Not a guess: `wgpu-hal`'s Metal backend gates
//!    `TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_BC` on `format_bc: os_is_mac` and the Vulkan backend on the device's
//!    `textureCompressionBC`, and bevy's `WgpuSettingsPriority::Functionality` (the default) requests
//!    every feature the adapter reports. Every desktop target we ship has it — but "every target we
//!    ship" is not "every device", so the fallback stays.
//! 2. **The dimensions must be whole 4x4 blocks.** A BC texture is addressed in blocks; a BLP whose
//!    mip 0 is not a multiple of 4 on both axes cannot be uploaded as one. Real 1.12 world art is
//!    power-of-two, so this practically never fires — it exists so that when it does, the texture
//!    renders decoded instead of failing.
//!
//! When either is false the caller decodes, exactly as before. That is why the fallback lives here
//! as one function and not as a flag threaded through two loaders: there is one rule, and both the
//! async `AssetLoader` lane ([`crate::blp`]) and the synchronous `WorldAssets` lane
//! ([`crate::world_assets`]) ask it the same question.
