//! Every `ERR_*` key this workspace names must be a real row of the client's message catalog.
//!
//! benilla writes these keys as string literals at ~160 call sites, and each one used to arrive by
//! hand-tracing a `push <id>; call CGGameUI::DisplayError` in the binary. A typo, a key from a
//! later expansion, or a plausible-looking invention would all have been invisible: the string
//! simply would not resolve in `GlobalStrings.lua`, and the reference's own data-suppression rule
//! means benilla shows *nothing* for an unresolvable key. Silence is the failure mode, which is the
//! worst kind — nobody files a bug about a toast they never saw.
//!
//! Since decision 1770 the surface those keys are shown on is read from
//! [`benilla_ui::messages`] rather than carried beside them, so a key that is not in the catalog
//! also silently takes the fallback. This walk is what keeps that fallback unreachable: it is the
//! tripwire that turns "we believe these are message ids" into a checked claim.
//!
//! It reads source text rather than any registry the code keeps, deliberately — a registry could
//! only contain what somebody remembered to register.
