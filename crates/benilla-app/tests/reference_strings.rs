//! **No user-facing sentence is written in Rust when the reference ships one.**
//!
//! The real client never composes display text: every sentence is a key into `GlobalStrings.lua`
//! (in-game) or `GlueStrings.lua` (the login/character screens) — each with a `Localize()` patch
//! file laid over it, which is where a good many of the sentences the player actually reads come
//! from (decision 2052) — resolved at runtime from the player's own install. Writing the English in
//! Rust throws away three things at once —
//! localization, and, for anything that goes through the message catalog, the *surface* the
//! message is shown on and the *voice line* it speaks with (decisions 1770, 1815, 2035).
//!
//! **Why a tripwire and not a review rule.** Decision 2035 found a loot-refusal table that had
//! composed its own eight sentences, six of which said something 1.12 never says, under a comment
//! asserting they were quoted from the reference. The comment was the only check there had ever
//! been, and a comment cannot fail. What makes that class *findable* is that a re-typed string is
//! byte-identical to the shipped one — so a walk that normalises both sides and compares them finds
//! every instance mechanically, which is what this does.
//!
//! **What it cannot find, stated plainly.** Text that matches nothing is invisible here: an
//! *invented* sentence (2035's "Those pockets are already empty.", for a code 1.12 has no string
//! for) has no shipped counterpart to match against. This tripwire catches the re-typing class,
//! which is the large one; the invention class needs a reader who checks the reference.
//!
//! **A literal beside a key lookup is correct and is not flagged** — a fallback for an install
//! whose chain lacks the key is the reference's own `UNKNOWNOBJECT` shape. The walk only counts a
//! literal whose enclosing function resolves nothing.
//!
//! [`ALLOWED`] is a **ratchet**: it records what was already drifted when the tripwire was built,
//! per file, and the counts may only ever go **down**. Converting a file means lowering its number
//! (or deleting the row); a file not listed may carry none at all. Skips without client data.

/// **Empty, and that is the point.** This was decision 2045's ratchet — a per-file budget of
/// re-typed sentences that might only ever go down — and it went down to nothing.
///
/// It stays as an empty list rather than being deleted with the machinery, because the walk below
/// is still the guard: a row appearing here is a file that started re-typing again, and the
/// argument for the rule holds whether or not anything is currently breaking it.
///
/// **The number went UP once before it went down, and that is the part worth remembering.** Two
/// defects in the walk itself — a `RESOLVERS` entry that a `sort_by_key` call satisfied, and a
/// `#[cfg(test)]` stripper blind to the out-of-line `mod tests;` — had it reporting 160 where the
/// truth was 180, hiding 36 literals inside one function while double-counting a handful
/// elsewhere. A ratchet is only ever as honest as the walk under it: a number that may only
/// decrease is worthless if the number was never right.
///
/// **What this walk still cannot do**, unchanged from 2045 and worth keeping in view now that the
/// count is zero: it finds *re-typed* strings, because those are byte-identical to the shipped
/// ones. It cannot find *invented* ones — text matching nothing has nothing to match against —
/// and it cannot see a one-word value, which collides with ordinary program text. Three invented
/// slot words and a hand-typed `LockType` name were found in this arc by reading the reference,
/// not by this test.
