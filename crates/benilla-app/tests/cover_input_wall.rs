//! **The cover-input wall** — the loading screen's input rule, counted from source on every
//! `cargo test`, so the swallow list can never quietly fall behind what the client actually reads.
//!
//! `loading_screen/input.rs` takes the whole input plane while the cover is up, at the source, in
//! `PreUpdate`. That cut is what makes the rule survive a consumer nobody remembered — the world
//! pick chain, which hovered units and changed the hardware cursor *through* the loading screen
//! until the director noticed. But a source cut only covers the channels it names, and bevy has
//! more channels than we currently read: touch, IME, gamepads, the trackpad gestures. The day
//! someone reads one of those, the cover has to grow a line — and nothing in the compiler will say
//! so.
//!
//! This is that "nothing". It scans every workspace source for the input channels the client
//! reaches for and requires each to carry a **verdict** in [`VERDICTS`] below:
//!
//! - **`Swallowed`** — the cover empties it. Cross-checked: the name must literally appear in the
//!   gate's own source, so the table cannot claim coverage the gate does not implement.
//! - **`Open`** — deliberately *not* swallowed, with the reason written down. Window lifecycle is
//!   the whole of this class today: a close request, a focus change and an occlusion change must
//!   still land while a load is running.
//! - **`Plumbing`** — a type, enum, plugin or system-set name that carries no player input at all.
//!
//! An unclassified name fails the test with the question it wants answered: *does the cover
//! swallow this?* Answering it is one line here and, when the answer is yes, one line in the gate.
