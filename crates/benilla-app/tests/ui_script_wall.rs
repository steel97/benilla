//! **The reverse wall of decision 1177, measured** — how many files in `benilla-app` outside the
//! VM's own module name `UiScript`.
//!
//! 1177 (2026-08-10) drew the line: the feed layer becomes one module, the only legitimate caller
//! of the Lua VM, and everything else produces model values. Its instrument was 1160's — a wall
//! test in `tests/` whose number is ratcheted down by the work — and it named the number: **141
//! files**. The instrument was never built, and with nothing failing the count went the other
//! way: 164 files by 2026-09-16 (decision 2265 §A3). This file is the instrument. It does not
//! decide whether the crate move happens — that stays the director's — it only makes the number
//! visible on every test run and refuses to let it grow unnoticed.
//!
//! "Outside the VM's module" means any `.rs` under `crates/benilla-app/src` whose path does not
//! start with `ui_script/`; 1177's "feed module" does not exist yet, and when it does the
//! exclusion moves there. A file counts if it contains the identifier `UiScript` at all — a type
//! in a parameter list, a `use`, a doc comment naming the seam: each is a place that knows the
//! FrameXML VM exists, which is the coupling 1177 measures.
//!
//! Same shape as `world_api_wall.rs`: `CEILING` is the standing count, `SLACK` keeps a single
//! closure from failing the gate while making it impossible to bank a whole stage of work without
//! writing the new number down. `WOW_UISCRIPT_DUMP=1` prints the files.

/// The standing count. **2026-09-16, 164** — measured the day the instrument was built, against
/// 1177's 141 five weeks earlier. It moved twice on that one day, for two different files, and
/// both reasons are kept because each is a different kind of legitimate:
///
/// - **165 (decision 2279)** — `game_plugins.rs`, the structural test for the VM's one-shot
///   consumers, which has to name the identifier it scans for. A test *about* the wall, not a file
///   that learned the VM exists.
/// - **166 (decision 2283)** — `capture/probe_stone.rs`, the meeting-stone live probe, joining the
///   fifteen sibling probes that read the VM *on purpose*. A probe's whole value is that it asks
///   the **stock** binding (`IsInMeetingStoneQueue()`, `MiniMapMeetingStoneFrame:IsShown()`)
///   rather than our own mirror of it, so feeding it a model value would make it prove nothing.
////// - **167 (decision 2290)** — `capture/probe_bg.rs`, the inside-a-battleground live probe, the
///   same class again and for the same reason, sharpened: it takes the port through the stock
///   `AcceptBattlefieldPort(slot, 1)` and reads the battleground back through
///   `GetNumWorldStateUI()`, `GetBattlefieldStatus()` and a Lua event tap. A probe that asked our
///   own model instead could not have found what this one did — that the battleground's
///   `CHAT_MSG_BG_SYSTEM_NEUTRAL` lines reach the interface, which no app-side reading shows.
///
/// The ratchet is for *production* feed code. Both numbers still went up, and both are written
/// down — which is the whole point of it, and why two sessions raising it the same day collided
/// here instead of quietly passing each other.
