//! **The world API wall** — the doorway of `benilla-world`, counted from source on every
//! `cargo test`, so it can never be measured once and then quietly widen.
//!
//! Decision 1160 splits the world renderer out of `benilla-app` into `benilla-world`, and its
//! *secondary* falsifier is a number: if the engine's public vocabulary is much larger than a
//! designed API, the cut line is wrong. 1163 measured it — **214 distinct engine items named by
//! gameplay code** — and set the gate at **forty**, with the sort into DOWN / PUBLISH / CLOSE as
//! the work. 1164 is that sort.
//!
//! A number in a decision record is a number nobody re-measures. This is the same measurement as
//! a test, so every commit that closes a leak shows up as [`CEILING`] going down, and every commit
//! that opens a new one fails the gate the day it lands rather than three weeks later.
//!
//! **It has two lives, and it switches by itself.** Before the move, the boundary is a naming
//! convention: gameplay files reaching `crate::<engine module>::…`. After the move it is a real
//! crate, and the same count is `benilla_world::…` in `benilla-app`'s sources. The scan below
//! looks for `crates/benilla-world` and measures whichever world exists — so the ratchet survives
//! stage two instead of being deleted by it.
//!
//! What it deliberately does **not** count: `#[cfg(test)]` bodies (a test naming an internal is
//! not an API consumer), doc comments (a `[`crate::x::Y`]` link is prose), and the composition
//! root's plugin registrations are counted like anything else — 1164's plugin-group collapse has
//! to actually happen for them to stop counting.

/// ordering law back from its caller; `ModelEffects` absorbs the entry point when it is built.
///
/// **150 → 176: the crate
/// exists, and the count switched to the thing it was always a proxy for.** Two reasons it went up,
/// both of them the measurement getting more honest rather than the doorway widening:
///
/// - The module-name scan excluded the *instruments* (`debug_panel`, `perf`, `pipe_warm`) as

///   the move was attempted: all three read the game, so they stayed in `benilla-app` — and they
///   consume the engine API like any other consumer, which they always did.
/// - `crate::x::Y` had to be parsed out of a naming convention. `benilla_world::x::Y` is a real
///   path the compiler agrees with, so nothing hides behind a form the parser did not anticipate.
///
/// The number to work down is this one. It is also the last time it can be argued with: from here
/// every item on it is a `pub` in `benilla-world`, and closing one is a demotion the compiler
/// checks.
///
/// 149 → 150: `SPAWN_XY`, the
/// streamer's last-ditch focus, moved out of `lib.rs` and into `terrain_stream` where it is used —
/// an engine that cannot answer "where do I stream from" with no game attached is not an engine.
/// The two gameplay readers (the player's boot pose, the world viewer's start) name it across the
/// line now; it bought the one reverse crossing that neither wall could see.
///
/// 155 → 156:
/// `model_fade::ModelFade` — 1164's alpha inversion, in one component. The game declares how
/// translucent a root should be; the engine owns the write, the chain composition and the material
/// swap. One published name for two impossible dependencies, and it retires a gameplay writer of a
/// channel the reference gives one owner.
///
/// 153 → 155:
/// `world_unit::{WorldUnit, ViewerUnit}` — a body in the world and the viewer's own, replacing
/// five engine lanes' filters on the game's wire record. Two published markers for three
/// impossible dependencies (`net::NetEntity`, `net::SelfPlayer`, `entities::CollisionHeight`).
///
/// 152 → 153: `view::Viewer`
/// — the avatar as a *body* (where, how fast, which way, how tall) rather than as the game's
/// `Player` type. Three engine lanes were reading it behind the identical predicate. One published
/// resource for two impossible dependencies.
///
/// 148 → 152: `creature_anim`
/// split along 1163's line — the rig machinery (pose evaluation, world/palette composition, the
/// global-sequence channels) became `rig_anim` and the game kept the policy. The four are the real
/// "pose a rig" vocabulary (`RigPose`, `RigFrame`/`RigAnchor`, `PosePost`, `GlobalSeqDrive`), and
/// they belong beside `RigPalettes` and `RigSkin` in 1164's *place* face — a second program that
/// spawns a skinned model has to pose it. They bought three impossible dependencies.
///
/// 147 → 148: 1160's wire
/// (b). The engine stopped reading the game's four-variant session enum to learn whether a world
/// exists and started reading its own one-bit `schedule::WorldLive`, which the session writes.
///
/// 145 → 147: 1160's wire
/// (a) inverted. The streamer stopped reading `player::Player` and started reading
/// `terrain_stream::ViewFocus`, which the game writes; and `WorldLoadProgress` — the streamer's
/// own residency fact, which had been living in `loading_screen` — came home, so its two readers
/// (the bar, and the mover's post-snap hold) now name it across the line. Two published inputs
/// bought four reverse crossings, and the enforcer stopped needing a stub avatar to boot.
///
/// 143 → 145: two capture
/// fixtures that had been living inside engine modules (`water_fx::view`, the foam viewer, and
/// `particles::census`, the draw-address probe) moved out to `capture`, where they belong — and
/// an instrument on the game side naming engine internals is a forward crossing where an
/// instrument *inside* the engine was not counted at all. Same shape as the 160 → 162 raise
/// below: the doorway did not widen, the measurement got honest. It closed three reverse
/// crossings, including an engine plugin that had to name `capture` to register a fixture.
///
/// 142 → 143: the depth-bias
/// ladder came together in `sky_order` as one `Rung` type. That is a genuinely new forward
/// crossing — gameplay lanes now name an engine rung where before each kept its own constant —
/// and it bought three REVERSE crossings, the ones that cannot exist at all once the crate does.
/// One published rung against three impossible dependencies is the trade, and the ladder is
/// engine API by 1164's own spine (a second program orders against the engine's frame).
///
/// 133 → 154, and this is the one to read first: it is not a leak, it is the wall admitting it
/// had been lying. `expand` stopped walking at a brace, so `use benilla_world::interact::{A, B}`
/// — the ordinary Rust import — collapsed to the bare module path and was then discarded as a
/// prefix. Only items written out fully qualified at a *usage* site were ever counted. Every
/// number this test has printed since the crate landed was an undercount of the same kind, and
/// the honest surface is 154. Found by disagreement: a second scanner put the total one item
/// lower while naming items this one had never heard of, and neither error was visible from
/// either side alone. `WOW_API_DUMP=1` exists because of this.
///
/// And 160 → 162, the first one: moving
/// `StreamActivity` out of `perf` and `DebugState` out of `debug_panel` did not widen the doorway,
/// it stopped two engine facts hiding inside instrument modules this test deliberately does not
/// count. The items were always crossing; the measurement improved. That is the only kind of raise
/// that is not a retreat — a raise for a NEW leak is the failure this number exists to catch.
///
/// And 158 → 159: `vis_chain::VisChainOnly`, a PUBLISH by 1164's test (decision 1441). The
/// chain-only visibility idiom — keep `Visibility`+`InheritedVisibility` (hide-propagation),
/// remove `ViewVisibility` (the per-camera sweep row) — is an ENGINE law about bevy's visibility
/// pipeline, but half the never-rendering hierarchy nodes it applies to are spawned game-side
/// (net-object roots, held-item and spell-fx wrappers, transports). Keeping it engine-private
/// would mean every game spawner hand-rolling `.remove::<ViewVisibility>()` with its own copy of
/// the why — the exact drift a named idiom exists to prevent; the trait is the smallest honest
/// carrier of the law.
///
/// And 157 → 158: `collision::ColliderEpoch`, a PUBLISH by 1164's test (decision 1384). It is the
/// stamp on the world's collider set — "the geometry you last asked has changed" — and the whole
/// point of it is that a *cached* collision answer must not outlive the world it described. The
/// engine owns the fact (the streamer's attach queue is what changes the set), the game owns two of
/// the three parties: the creature ground clamp reads it, and the GameObject hull lane
/// (`entities::attach`) is the one collider insert outside the streamer's queue, so it must be able
/// to stamp. Keeping it engine-private would mean either a game-side collider that no cache can see
/// arrive — which is B197's bug with a different collider class — or an engine system reaching into
/// game components to invalidate them, which crosses this line the other way and worse.
///
/// And 156 → 157: `mat_anim_table::MatAnimTable`, a PUBLISH by 1164's test (decision 1381). The
/// mat-anim delta table replaced per-frame material mutation, and registration must happen where
/// materials are BUILT — which for WMO GameObject props (transport interiors) is a game-side
/// spawner (`entities::wmo_props`) that already threads the two registries this table serves
/// (`UvAnimMaterials`/`TintAnimMaterials`, published members of the same family). The resource
/// that allocates the slots is the smallest honest addition beside them; hiding it would mean
/// a game-side material registering without a slot and silently freezing at its seed.
///
/// And 155 → 156: `doodad_anim::DoodadAnimHost`, a PUBLISH by 1164's test (decision 1365). The
/// doodad joint collapse put placed doodads on the collapsed-rig lane (`RigPose`), which made
/// them visible to the game's animation-LOD gate — whose park marker the engine's own doodad
/// draw gate already owns, on a different law (the composed draw verdict + fade sphere, not the
/// unit frustum test). Two writers to one marker silently un-park hidden hosts, so the game's
/// gate must be able to say "this population is not mine" — and the engine component that IS
/// that population's name is the smallest honest way to say it. The instruments already named
/// it; this makes the one gameplay filter explicit rather than inventing a second marker to
/// carry the same fact.
///
/// And 154 → 155: `modkeys::SyntheticHold`, a PUBLISH by 1164's test rather than a leak. The
/// engine owns the macOS stuck-modifier reconciler, and that reconciler decides by polling the
/// **hardware** flag state — which by construction reads "up" for a key no hand is on. So a
/// synthesized press (the probe harness's `WOW_PROBE_KEY`) was released the frame after it was
/// made, and logged as a stuck-key correction: every chord binding was silently unreachable
/// headlessly on the platform we develop on. "Something is deliberately holding this key" has
/// exactly one reader — the reconciler, engine-side — and its writers are whoever synthesizes
/// input, which is game-side; a one-field resource is the smallest honest expression of that. The
/// alternative was ordering a game system against an engine system, which crosses this same line
/// *and* publishes a schedule point to do it.
/// And 159 → 160: `WorldLoadProgress::gx_pending`, a PUBLISH beside the two residency terms
/// already through this door (`colliders_pending`, `merge_pending`). The retained pass (1429)
/// moved the static world off the entity path, so a placement that has SPAWNED still draws
/// nothing until its region bakes — and the game reads residency for two decisions the engine
/// does not own: when the loading cover may lift, and when the post-snap physics hold may
/// release (decision 0737's split). Both were answering "is the world there" with a fact that
/// had stopped meaning it (decision 1498). The alternative was the game reaching into
/// `StaticGx` itself, which is a whole engine subsystem through the door instead of one
/// `usize` on the residency struct that exists to be read from outside.
