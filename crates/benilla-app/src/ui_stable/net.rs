    // error dialog, once per unstable.

    // `petnamecache.wdb`, which **persists across sessions**, so a pet you have owned before is
    // already warm before the packet arrives. benilla has no such file, so a window the reference
    // has practically closed is wide open for us. Seeding is not a workaround for the missing
    // cache — it is using the answer the server has already sent us in this very packet.
