//! Group/party session state — the `SMSG_GROUP_LIST` wire mirror and the client-composed party
//! system lines (decision 0434 §D2).
//!
//! The 1.12 server sends **no text** for party events (vmangos, exhaustively grepped): joins and
//! leaves appear only as roster diffs on `SMSG_GROUP_LIST`, a kick additionally announces itself
//! to the kicked player as the empty-body `SMSG_GROUP_UNINVITE`, and `SMSG_PARTY_COMMAND_RESULT`
//! acks only the acting player. The real client composes every "%s joins the party." line
//! engine-side from those packets against the GlobalStrings templates (the FrameXML never touches
//! the `ERR_*` group strings; the mechanism is wow-re's verified errorId→GlobalStrings display,
//! `CGGameUI::DisplayError` 0x496720). benilla does the same here: [`GroupState`] mirrors the
//! wire, and its `apply_*` methods return the finished lines for the net drain to push as
//! CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM. The mapping is **byte-verified** (decision 0440's §5 fold-back, wow-re
//! `system/object-layer/scratch/party-group-wire.md`, commit `a07c311c`): each opcode prints
//! its own line and the GROUP_LIST diff prints the rest — there is NO empty-list state machine.
//!
//! The line law (0440):
//! - GROUP_LIST runs an **ungated** two-way roster diff: new guid → "%s joins the party."
//!   (`0x5e6c19` — including everyone already there on a first roster), vanished guid →
//!   "%s leaves the party." (`0x5e6d37` — including the whole roster on our own empty list).
//! - "You leave the group." comes ONLY from `SMSG_PARTY_COMMAND_RESULT(LEAVE, ok)` (`0x5e690b`).
//! - `SMSG_GROUP_UNINVITE` (kick) → "You have been removed from the group.", unconditional.
//! - `SMSG_GROUP_DESTROYED` → "Your group has been disbanded.", gated on being grouped. The
//!   vmangos 2-man collapse sends no GROUP_DESTROYED (`Disband(hideDestroy=true)`,
//!   `Group.cpp:533`), so the survivor sees only the leave-diff line — rendered faithfully
//!   (the 0086 server-divergence precedent).
