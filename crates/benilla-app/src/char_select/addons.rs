//! The **character-select AddOns screen** (decisions 1197, 1293) — the one addon surface (the
//! in-game panel was retired at the director's call, 2026-08-14; `ReloadUI` itself stays).
//!
//! The reference is `Interface\GlueXML\AddonList.xml/.lua`, read off the player's own patch chain
//! (`patch.MPQ` — 1293 located it after 1197 believed it missing), and **this screen now draws the
//! authored layout**: the six `HelpFrame-*` plate pieces that are the whole framed panel, the
//! `UI-DialogBox-Header` title plate, the `GlueCloseButton`, the `GlueDropDownMenuTemplate`
//! control, the 19×(16+4) entry column, the `GlueScrollFrameTemplate` bar with the
//! `UI-Character-ScrollBar` track, and the four-button bottom row in the reference's own order
//! (Disable All · Enable All ··· Okay · Cancel). Geometry constants below are the authored
//! numbers, resolved top-down into the 640×512 plate. Behaviour is **re-expressed natively** —
//! written under 1234's rule, which 1602 has since retired; the native form stays as a design
//! choice, not a law.
//!
//! ## What the reference does, and what we do
//!
//! `AddonList_Update` per row: a **tri-state** checkbox (`GetAddOnEnableState` → 0/1/2, the grey
//! check drawn with `UI-CheckBox-Check-Disabled`), the title (`## Title` else the folder name)
//! coloured **gold when loadable, red when enabled-and-broken — except `DEP_DISABLED`, which reads
//! grey** (AddonList.lua's own exception), and the status token (`getglobal("ADDON_"..reason)`) in
//! `GlueFontNormalSmall` 30 units right of the title box. Titles render their `|cAARRGGBB` markup
//! as colour, exactly as every FontString does — as does every other string on this screen,
//! the tooltip included ([`crate::glue::widgets::markup_spans`]). Hovering a row raises
//! `AddonTooltip` (title + notes + `ADDON_DEPENDENCIES`) anchored to the row's left; hovering a
//! MIXED checkbox raises `ENABLED_FOR_SOME`. **A row has no hover highlight and no row-click** —
//! only the checkbox toggles (the entry template carries no `HighlightTexture` and no `OnClick`);
//! reproducing that is also what killed the hover-respawn flashing the director reported: the
//! spawned tree no longer changes under the cursor at all.
//!
//! Carried from 1197/1293: the character dropdown ("All" + the realm roster, staging
//! per-character), the `checkAddonVersion`-inverted force-load checkbox, Okay = `SaveAddOns`
//! (write the per-character enable files; the next login IS the apply point), Cancel/ESC/the X =
//! `ResetAddOns` (discard). **Not built**, per 1197's standing rejections (Script Memory
//! reaffirmed by the director, 2026-08-14): the Script Memory dial, the URL/update launch buttons
//! (`## URL` shows in the tooltip instead — information, not a trigger), the security icon.
//!
//! ## Why it reads the folder rather than the VM
//!
//! At character select no addon has been *loaded* — `load_third_party` is a world-entry step
//! (1191 §2) — so `GetNumAddOns()` would answer 0. The screen asks
//! [`crate::ui_script::addons::installed`] instead: the same discovery, the same manifest parser,
//! the same enable files. Two views of one folder, never two folders. With the dropdown that read
//! happens **once per roster character at open** ([`AddonsPanel::open_for`]).
