//! Character select — the faithful glue screen (decision 0465, superseding 0193 §4's v1 overlay).
//!
//! Owns [`ClientState`], the app's lifecycle state machine: `CharSelect` is the pre-world "glue"
//! layer (the real client's GlueXML universe — login/realm/select screens), `InWorld` is the game.
//! The IO thread parks after the world handshake and emits the account roster
//! ([`CharListMessage`]); the **pick policy** here decides what answers it — the pending pick
//! (seamless reconnect, decision 0065), the `WOW_CHAR` env fast path, or the director's choice on
//! the screen. The pick travels the [`CharPick`] channel; `Connected` flips us `InWorld`;
//! a `/logout` round-trip ([`LoggedOutMessage`]) flips back with the pending pick cleared.
//!
//! The screen is the reference's own arrangement (`CharacterSelect.xml/.lua`, extracted off the
//! patch chain — decision 0465): the fullscreen `UI_<Race>` glue scene with the **selected
//! character standing in it, geared from its enum record** (the glue booth), the right-column
//! character list (realm banner, ten row buttons, Create New Character), Enter World / Back /
//! Delete Character along the bottom, the rotate pair, drag-to-rotate, arrow-key cycling,
//! double-click-to-enter, and the typed-`DELETE` confirm dialog. Art/strings/sounds come off the
//! player's own client data ([`crate::glue`]) — never embedded.
//!
//! Module split: this file (state machine + roster policy + shared display constants),
//! [`screen`] (the authored layout), [`refresh`] (list/banner/booth-feed refresh), [`input`]
//! (clicks, keys, rotation, the flows), [`dialog`] (the delete confirm).
