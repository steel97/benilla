//! **Chat bubbles** — `CGChatBubbleFrame` (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/chat-bubble.md`,
//! §5-verified 2026-07-11; decision 0288's phase-9 tail, landed by decision 0598): the
//! over-the-head speech bubble a chat line spawns, a **2-D overlay** like the V-plate
//! ([`crate::vplates`]) and unlike the world-pass overhead *names* ([`crate::nameplates`]).
//!
//! The pinned law, transcribed:
//! - **Spawn** (`0x608ac0`, one caller — the SMSG_MESSAGECHAT display path): the sender GUID
//!   typed-looks-up to a live unit or no bubble; CVar select `ChatBubbles` (party lines:
//!   `ChatBubblesParty`); non-empty text; **no active V-plate on the unit** (`0x608adc` —
//!   mutual exclusion both ways: a live bubble in turn suppresses the floating overhead name,
//!   [`BubblesActive`]); the local player resolves; 3-D dist² ≤ 400 (20 yd). Self is NOT
//!   excluded. **Replace, never queue**: a new line tears the old bubble down first.
//! - **Lifetime** (`0x4b1810`): word-count-scaled, self-vs-other asymmetric —
//!   `2750 + 750·(words−1)` ms for others, `1500 + 500·(words−1)` for the local player
//!   (your own bubbles are shorter-lived); words = space/tab-run count. 250 ms linear fade-in;
//!   at `create + duration + 250` a permanent 250 ms fade-out, then the frame recycles. The
//!   20 yd gate re-tests **every frame**: out of range fades out *recoverable*, back in range
//!   fades back in.
//! - **Geometry** (`0x4b0940`/`0x4b1600`): the classic `Backdrop` construct —
//!   `ChatBubble-Background` flat fill, `ChatBubble-Backdrop` 8-piece edge
//!   ([`benilla_ui::script::backdrop::pieces`], the same engine geometry FrameXML backdrops
//!   use), `ChatBubble-Tail` a separate square of side = the border-unit, TOPRIGHT on the
//!   frame's BOTTOM + (0, border/4). Border-unit = insets = edge-size = **16/1024 of the
//!   screen width** (`G44·16/(S·1024)`); text = `NAMEPLATE_FONT` at 0.01 gx, wrap hard-capped
//!   at **0.2 gx**, floor 2·border-unit; the frame hugs the text layout ± **0.01 gx** on all
//!   four sides; text colored by chatType (the 94-entry table ≡ [`default_color`]), rendered
//!   PLAIN (`||`→`|`, color/hyperlink escapes stripped — [`sanitize`]).
//! - **Anchor** (`0x4b0c30`): `worldZ = unit.z + attachmentHeight·modelScale + 0.7`, projected
//!   by the plate/name projector, seated **BOTTOM at the point, growing upward** (the mirror
//!   of the plate, which hangs down). `attachmentHeight` is `0x4b0e38 call 0x711a20` — a read of
//!   the **MD20 header image**, i.e. the **Stand sequence CAaBox's Z extent**, a file constant
//!   with no bone matrix anywhere in its call tree — and the scaled product is **latched** at
//!   `bubble+0x354` behind a parity guard, so it is queried exactly **once per chat line**
//!   ([`crate::entities::StandBoxHeight`], wow-re's anchor cross-check 2026-08-17; 1406).
//!
//! Named divergences (all deliberate, decisions 0598/0599):
//! - **`ChatBubblesParty` defaults ON** (binary default "0") — the director asked for `/p`
//!   bubbles; same posture as [`crate::vplates::VPlateMode`].
//! - **The v1 kind set is SAY/YELL/PARTY + monster say/yell.** The byte gate is
//!   "sender resolves", not a type whitelist, which *implies* guild/officer/whisper/emote
//!   bubbles too — but that category claim is INFERRED on an OPEN wire-type remap
//!   (chat-bubble.md §1) and contradicts the remembered reference look, so the uncontested
//!   set ships and a capture can widen it ([`bubble_cvar`]).
//! - ~~**The anchor height is the posed overhead attachment**~~ — **REFUTED and removed (1406).**
//!   This shipped as an INFERRED equivalence ("both are the head-region attachment height,
//!   model-scaled") between the overhead-name chain `0x608640` and the bubble's `0x711a20`. They
//!   are not equivalent, and they differ on exactly the axis that mattered: `0x608640` reads the
//!   live posed palette and tracks the pose, `0x711a20` reads file bytes. The overhead *name*
//!   keeps `0x608640`; the bubble now takes the Stand-box constant the bytes actually specify. It
//!   sits **0.199 model units lower** on a human male (2.0128 vs the attachment's 2.2120) — a
//!   deliberate, measured move toward the reference, not a regression.
//! - **Sizes ride the plates' damped diagonal basis** ([`plate_basis`], decisions 0185/0186)
//!   so bubble text and plate text stay the same em at every window — the same director-pinned
//!   deviation from the unbounded byte law.
//! - **No per-frame occlusion fade**: the client also fades a bubble whose speaker model isn't
//!   render-visible (`0x7103d0`/`0x6704c0`); v1 re-tests distance only. Residual named in 0598.
//!
//! (0598 briefly shipped the plate-blocks-bubble gate UN-transcribed — bubbles stacked over our
//! then-always-on plates. 0599 restored the faithful gate and booted friendly plates OFF
//! instead, so friendly/party bubbles have room the reference way.)
