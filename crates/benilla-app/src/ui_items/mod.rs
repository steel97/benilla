//! The app-side **container feed** (decision 0068 T2) — the inward half of the container seam
//! around [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `container` module.
//!
//! Each frame, the player's own descriptor names the bag layout (the PRIVATE `PACK_SLOT` array =
//! the backpack; `INV_SLOT` 19–22 = the equipped bags, each a container object with its own
//! `CONTAINER_FIELD_SLOT` array; `KEYRING_SLOT` 81.. = the keyring, decision 0765 — a container
//! with no container *object*, exactly like the bank), the item store ([`crate::items::Items`]) resolves slot guids to
//! instances (entry, stack count), the template cache resolves entries to name/quality (ask-once
//! `ITEM_QUERY_SINGLE` — a slot whose answer is in flight shows as an unresolved occupied slot and
//! fills in when it lands), and `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc` turns the template's display id into the
//! icon. The assembled per-bag [`ContainerState`](benilla_ui::script::ContainerState)s are diffed
//! against what the VM holds and pushed with `BAG_UPDATE(bagID)` per changed bag (+ one trailing
//! `BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED`, the live client's batch-end signal that bag addons coalesce on) — the
//! [`feed`] submodule.
//!
//! The outward half ([`drain`]) drains `UseContainerItem(bagID, slot)` intents into the wire,
//! mapping the Lua bag space onto the wire's (backpack = bag 255 + the player-array slot 23…;
//! equipped bags = their own array slot 19–22 + 0-based inner slot — VERIFIED vmangos `Player.h`
//! enums + `UseItem::ReadFromWorldPacket`, shared by every drain here as [`wire_pos`]) and making
//! the real client's **equip-vs-use fork**: an *equippable* item (template `inventoryType != 0`,
//! and not a quest-starter) goes out as `CMSG_AUTOEQUIP_ITEM` — a helm click puts the helm on —
//! everything else through the one use fork ([`item_use_command`], our `CGItem::Use`), which sends
//! `CMSG_QUESTGIVER_QUERY_QUEST` for a quest-starter and `CMSG_USE_ITEM` for everything else
//! (decision 0664). Server refusals (`SMSG_INVENTORY_CHANGE_FAILURE` → [`EquipErrors`]) surface on
//! the red UI error line with the client's message strings. The cursor-payload drains (decision
//! 0216, whole-space since slice 2) ride the same wire map: a queued pick/place/swap move →
//! `CMSG_SWAP_INV_ITEM` (backpack-internal) or `CMSG_SWAP_ITEM` (either end an equipped bag) /
//! `CMSG_SPLIT_ITEM` (`drain::drain_container_moves`), a popup-confirmed destroy →
//! `CMSG_DESTROYITEM` (`drain::drain_container_destroys`).
//!
//! **The pending-op lock** ([`crate::pending_item_ops::PendingItemOps`], decision 0216 §4 /
//! byte-verified 0218 §3): every move/split/destroy drain locks the live-API `(bag, slot)`
//! positions it sends — both ends of a move/split ("a send locks both ends"), the one slot of a
//! destroy — until the descriptor's own field-update stream resolves the slot or the server
//! answers a non-zero `SMSG_INVENTORY_CHANGE_FAILURE`. [`feed::feed_containers`] reads it into
//! each pushed `ContainerSlot::locked` and fires `ITEM_LOCK_CHANGED` on every transition the
//! drains don't already fire themselves.
