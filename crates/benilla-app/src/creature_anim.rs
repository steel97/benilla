//! Movement-driven character & creature animation (decision 0019, Milestone C; the locomotion controller
//! of decisions 0047 + 0049). Each animated unit carries a [`ModelAnimations`] component (its clips, by
//! `AnimationData.dbc` id), an [`AnimationPlayer`], and an
//! [`AnimationTransitions`][bevy::animation::transition::AnimationTransitions]; this module is a
//! small per-unit state machine that picks the animation from the unit's movement state, **cross-fades**
//! into it over the clip's blend-in time, and scales a locomotion clip's playback rate to the unit's
//! speed.
//!
//! Regimes (decisions 0049 → 0083/0087):
//! - **Gait** — the directly-cross-faded ground/swim gaits + idle: Stand / Walk / Run / Fast-run by speed,
//!   WalkBackwards when moving back, the swim ids when swimming (verified client selector, wow-5875-re
//!   RF-0057). A change cross-fades to the new clip over its `blend_time` instead of snapping.
//! - **Special** — the stand-state poses (sit/sleep/kneel: down → loop → up) as one-shot-bracketed
//!   loops, **preemptible** (decision 0055), plus the jump's enter/hang. The jump's *landing* is NOT a
//!   bracket: [`select::Mode::Land`] is a plain pick from the input at touchdown, freely overwritten the
//!   instant a movement flag changes (decisions 0083/0087 — land-then-press runs immediately).
//! - **One-shots (swings, emotes)** — routed **per play from live state** (decision 0087, the
//!   byte-verified `0x5fe2f0` route): a standing-idle unit plays them full-body on the base track
//!   ([`select::Mode::Swing`]); a moving / seated / combat-airborne unit plays them on the SpineLow
//!   torso-masked overlay ([`AnimClip::upper_node`]) while the base keeps driving the legs underneath —
//!   never dropped, never bracket-gated.
//!
//! The playback **rate** of a locomotion clip is `speed / sequence.moveSpeed` (wow-5875-re `0x5fe2f0`), so
//! a unit moving faster than the clip's design speed cycles its legs proportionally faster (the fix for a
//! backpedal that otherwise drags). Non-locomotion clips (idle, the jump/sit transitions — `moveSpeed 0`)
//! play at 1×. Death (decoded health 0) overrides everything.
//!
//! The movement view is unified per unit ([`select::unify`]): the self-avatar's [`MovementState`] is
//! filled by the player controller from input; a **remote player**'s comes from its relayed
//! `MSG_MOVE_*` stream (live CMovement flags + extrapolation speed, via [`crate::net::RemoteMotion`]),
//! so its walk/run/ strafe/backpedal/turn animate from the real flags; a **creature**'s is derived from
//! its server [`crate::net::Spline`] (forward + speed). Stand-state (sit/sleep/kneel/chairs) comes from
//! the unit's `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_1` byte for streamed units, and from the controller (echo + in-flight
//! request) for our own avatar (decision 0080c).
