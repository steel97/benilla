//! **"The selected one is always Onewarrior no matter what char I log into."** — the director's
//! character-switch report, reproduced at the edge that causes it.
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! The symptom arrived as a dropdown bug: Bagnon's character menu never moved its checkmark off
//! whoever the session started as. It is not a dropdown bug and it is not Bagnon's. Every addon on
//! the machine reads the live character **once, at file scope** — `local currentPlayer =
//! UnitName("player")` is the corpus idiom, not an idiosyncrasy — and until this landed the file
//! scope ran exactly once per **process**. Logging out to the character screen and back in kept the
//! same VM, so nothing re-read it.
//!
//! The tests here drive the two real edges — [`super::load_ingame_ui_on_world_entry`] and
//! [`super::end_ui_session`] — over a planted addon that captures the name the same way, and assert
//! the second login sees the second character. Reverting the rebuild makes
//! [`the_second_login_runs_addon_file_scope_under_the_second_character`] report `Onehunter`, which
//! is the director's screenshot in one string.
//!
//! Nothing here needs the client install or the addon corpus: the probe addon is written into a
//! hermetic `BENILLA_HOME` by the test itself.
