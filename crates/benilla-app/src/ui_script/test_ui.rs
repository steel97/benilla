//! **The tests' interface loader — one copy, both stores** (decision 1751).
//!
//! Half a dozen test files carried an identical private `load_xml` that read
//! `assets/ui/<name>` off disk, parsed it, and asserted the loader reported no errors — each with
//! the comment "duplicated so this file is self-contained". That was fine while `assets/ui` was
//! the only place an interface file could come from. It is not any more: a migrated window's file
//! lives in the player's own patch chain, so a test that wants bag windows has to name
//! `Interface\FrameXML\ContainerFrame.xml`, and six copies of a disk-only reader cannot say that.
//!
//! [`load_ui`] is that reader, generalised the same way [`super::manifest::load_manifest`] is:
//! **a bare filename is a file we ship, a path is one off the player's install.** The two are told
//! apart by [`super::reference_ui::is_chain_entry`], the manifest's own rule, so a test loads the
//! entries in the order `benilla.toc` names them and gets what the client gets.
//!
//! It reads the SOURCE TREE rather than the compiled-in copy, deliberately: these tests exist to
//! catch a mistake in a file somebody just edited, and `content::read`'s dev-build probe already
//! prefers disk for the same reason.

///
/// Three of these are load-bearing in a way that is invisible if you leave them out:
///
/// * **`GlobalStrings.lua`** — the stock file concatenates `GROUP` and `GIVE_LOOT` while building
///   the master-loot menu. The app loads the player's own copy ahead of the whole manifest at VM
///   setup; a bare `UiScript::new()` does not. Our deleted `LootFrame.xml` carried
///   `X = X or "…"` fallbacks for precisely these; the stock file carries none.
/// * **`ItemButtonTemplate.xml`** — stock `LootButtonTemplate` inherits it, and a missing template
///   is a loader *warning*, not an error. Leave it out and every row loads clean with no art and
///   no `$parentIconTexture`, which reads as a pass until an assertion looks for an icon.
/// * **`PartyFrame.xml`** — for `MAX_PARTY_MEMBERS`, which stock `LootFrame.lua:217` does
///   arithmetic on at LOAD time, not at click time. Its home is the reference's own
///   (`PartyMemberFrame.lua:1`), and it wants the dropdown kit and `UnitPopup` ahead of it — the
///   manifest's order (167 → 185 → 262), reproduced rather than short-circuited. Setting the
///   constant by hand would pass and teach nothing about the real load.
///
/// Needs client data, like [`BAG_UI`]: open with `benilla_formats::wow_data_or_skip!()`.
/// What the **vendor window** needs before `Interface\FrameXML\MerchantFrame.xml` will load and

///
/// The two that fail in the ways worth naming:
///
/// * **`BasicControls.xml`** — for `TEXT()`, the reference's identity-function wrapper, which

///   `MerchantFrame_UpdateMerchantInfo`, which is the first thing the window does when it shows.

///   `ShowWatchedReputationBarText` / `HideWatchedReputationBarText`, which the window's
