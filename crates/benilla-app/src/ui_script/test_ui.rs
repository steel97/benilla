//! **The tests' interface loader — one copy, both stores** (decision 1751).
//!
//! Half a dozen test files carried an identical private `load_xml` that read
//! `assets/ui/<name>` off disk, parsed it, and asserted the loader reported no errors — each with
//! the comment "duplicated so this file is self-contained". That was fine while `assets/ui` was
//! the only place an interface file could come from. It is not any more: a migrated window's file
//! lives in the player's own patch chain, so a test that wants bag windows has to name
//! `Interface\FrameXML\ContainerFrame.xml`, and six copies of a disk-only reader cannot say that.
//!
//! [`load_ui`] is that reader, generalised the same way [`super::manifest::load_manifest`] is:
//! **a bare filename is a file we ship, a path is one off the player's install.** The two are told
//! apart by [`super::reference_ui::is_chain_entry`], the manifest's own rule, so a test loads the
//! entries in the order `benilla.toc` names them and gets what the client gets.
//!
//! It reads the SOURCE TREE rather than the compiled-in copy, deliberately: these tests exist to
//! catch a mistake in a file somebody just edited, and `content::read`'s dev-build probe already
//! prefers disk for the same reason.

///   is a loader *warning*, not an error. Leave it out and every row loads clean with no art and
///   no `$parentIconTexture`, which reads as a pass until an assertion looks for an icon.

///   arithmetic on at LOAD time, not at click time. Its home is the reference's own
///   (`PartyMemberFrame.lua:1`), and it wants the dropdown kit and `UnitPopup` ahead of it — the
