//! **The reference FrameXML this client EXECUTES off the player's own patch chain**, rather than
//! shipping a copy of it — the mechanism half of decision 1751.
//!
//! ## The rule
//!
//! The end state for the in-game interface is the stock 1.12 FrameXML, run off the file the player
//! already owns. `assets/ui` is scaffolding: it retires file by file, and a migrated window means
//! *its stock XML + Lua run off the chain and our counterpart file is deleted* (1751 §2). Fidelity
//! by construction — the reference's text cannot drift from itself, and every frame name, id,
//! template and stratum an addon reaches for is right because it **is** the reference's.
//!
//! What stays ours permanently: the glue screens (0068 §8 — GlueXML is a separate engine surface
//! even in the real client), dev-only frames, and adapter shims only while a genuine engine
//! difference forces one.
//!
//! ## Where the list lives — the manifest, not a second list in Rust
//!
//! Until 1751 this module carried its own `SOURCED` array and ran it *before* `assets/ui`, which
//! was the only ordering a Lua-only mechanism could express. Sourcing **XML** needs a real
//! position in the load order instead: stock `ContainerFrame.xml` inherits `ItemButtonTemplate`,
//! `CooldownFrameTemplate`, `SmallMoneyFrameTemplate` and `UIPanelCloseButton`, so it has to load
//! *after* the files that declare them.
//!
//! So there is exactly one ordered list of what loads and when, and it is `assets/ui/benilla.toc`
//! — the manifest that already had that job. **A manifest entry carrying a path separator is
//! sourced off the chain; a bare filename is a file we ship** ([`is_chain_entry`]). Our tree is
//! flat, so the two can never be confused, and the migration reads as what it is: the line
//! `BagFrame.xml` becomes `Interface\FrameXML\ContainerFrame.xml`, and `BagFrame.xml` is deleted.
//!
//! Everything else — the XML parse, `<Include>` / `<Script file=>` resolution against the
//! document's own directory, chunk naming, the error reporting that reaches the player — is
//! [`super::addons::Addon`]'s, unchanged. This module is only a third [`super::addons::Source`]:
//! *the player's install*.
//!
//! ## Where a reference file and our own UI still collide, and which one wins
//!
//! **Order decides, and the manifest is the order.** A name defined by both goes to whichever line
//! is later. That is the whole rule; there is no precedence machinery. A file sourced *before* our
//! own has its collisions overwritten by ours; a file sourced at the position of the window it
//! replaces owns its names outright, which is what migrating a window means.
//!
//! The load-bearing example was `PaperDollFrame.lua`, sourced far above everything for one
//! frame-agnostic button family while our own `CharacterFrame.xml` won the eighteen names it
//! collided on. Decision 1751 migrated that window, so the file arrives at its own position now
//! and there is nothing left for it to collide with — which is what a finished migration looks
//! like.
//!
//! **Nothing is stubbed silently.** A reference body that reaches for something this client does
//! not have raises, naming it — which is loud, correct, and strictly better than a no-op that
//! pretends (1203, 1205, 1211, 1230). The answer is to build the verb, or to adapt the body in one
//! of our own files and say why at the site.
//!
//! ## No install, no file
//!
//! A machine with no client data (CI, a bare checkout) simply does not get these files, and says so
//! once, loudly. It is the same condition under which `GlobalStrings` is absent, and the addon
//! survey already prints which mode it ran in for that reason. An install-less checkout cannot run
//! most meaningful UI tests anyway — the art, fonts and MPQs come from the install too — so tests
//! that need these files gate on the install like every other client-data test.

    /// eye means reading a stock file, listing the globals it calls, and grepping each one; that is
    /// slow, and it is wrong in both directions. It over-reports (a name that exists in a comment

    /// under-reports the things a grep cannot see at all: an XML element type the loader does not
    /// build, a script handler nothing dispatches, an attribute silently dropped (1739 measured 151
    /// of those), a template inherited before its definer.
    ///
    /// So the probe does not analyse. It **loads the file** — the whole shipped manifest first, into
    /// a fresh VM, exactly as a real run does, and then the candidate off the chain on top — and
    /// reports what the loader and the VM actually said. That is ground truth: the same machinery
    /// that would run it for real, answering the same question, with no model of the engine in
    /// between that could be out of date.

    /// **What a clean line does and does not mean.** It means the file *loads* — every element
    /// built, every template resolved, every load-time body ran without raising. It does not mean
    /// the window *works*: a verb that only a click reaches is not exercised by loading, and neither
    /// is anything behind an event. Clean is "start here", not "done"; the window's own test module
    /// and the director's eye are what finish it (§7).
    ///
    /// **Loading on top of the manifest, not instead of it**, because that is the position a
    /// migrated file occupies — every template it inherits is declared by an earlier entry, and
    /// asking whether `ContainerFrame.xml` loads *alone* only measures that it has predecessors.

    /// ## The false positive this method has, and how to recognise it

    /// A candidate whose frame NAMES our own shipped file already owns produces failures that are
    /// artefacts of the probe, not of the window. `publish_global` is deliberately non-overwriting
    /// (RF-0023), so the second frame to claim a name gets a wrapper that `_G` never points at —
    /// and any reference body using the `getglobal(this:GetName())` idiom then reads a DIFFERENT
    /// table than the `this` it just wrote to.
    ///
    /// That is exactly what the money frames look like: stock `TradeFrame.xml` reports
    /// `MoneyFrame_Update: attempt to index local 'info'`, because `MoneyFrame_SetType` set
    /// `this.info` on the new frame and `MoneyFrame_Update` read it back off OUR TradeFrame's
    /// same-named one. Delete our counterpart — which is what migrating the window does — and the
    /// collision goes with it. The same shape covers `MailFrame` and `QuestLogFrame`.

    /// * `fx=` — the reference has it as a FrameXML function. Cheap by comparison: it lives in
    ///   some stock file, and the name beside it says which, so sourcing that file may be the whole
    ///   fix. `GetText` looked like an engine binding for an hour and turned out to be
    ///   `LocaleProperties.lua`; this column is that lesson, mechanised.
    /// * A name in NEITHER is dropped, and that is the load-bearing filter: 1.12's widget methods
    ///   do not live in `_G`, so `SetText(` and `Hide(` and their two hundred siblings would
    ///   otherwise drown the report. Anything the reference's own global table does not carry is
    ///   not a global.
    ///
    /// **What "already has" means, and why it is asked of a LOADED VM.** An earlier hand-rolled
    /// version of this compared against a bare `UiScript::new()`, which is the ENGINE surface
    /// alone — so every FrameXML function our own interface defines (`ShowUIPanel`,

    /// mostly noise. Here the manifest is loaded first and `_G` is read after, so the answer is

    /// `engine=` and `fx=` read bare `Name(` globals. `method=` reads `:Name(` calls against the
    /// method surface this engine actually exposes. `LOAD:` is the stock file loaded on top of our
    /// manifest in a fresh VM — the same pass [`chain_readiness_report`] makes, run here so the
    /// answer is in one table.
    ///
    /// That last one is 1801, and it is the same mistake as the third column one step later.

    /// the readiness probe was printing `4 issue(s)` for it in a different table. Both tables were
    /// right. Joining them was left to whoever read them, and I read it wrong.
    ///
    /// Until 1798 the method sites were **silently dropped**: a name in neither the engine nor the
    /// FrameXML half of `1.12-globals.tsv` was assumed to be a widget method and skipped, on the
    /// reasoning that widget methods are not in `_G`. True, and it meant the report could not see
    /// a widget method we had *not built*. `MerchantFrame.xml` read `0 engine` and
    /// [`chain_readiness_report`] read CLEAN while the stock row's `<OnEnter>` called
    /// `ShoppingTooltip1:SetMerchantCompareItem(...)`, which this engine does not have — so the
    /// file loaded, every check passed, and hovering a vendor row would have raised in play. Both
    /// instruments were right about what they measure. Neither measured the window.
    ///
    /// **A remaining `<?>` in the `fx=` column is usually a LoadOnDemand addon**, not something to

    /// manifest also defines.

    /// do not ship under its own name usually has a counterpart of ours under a different one, and

    /// global function assignment is an overwrite. So the moment a window migrates and its chain
    /// entry lands BELOW one of our files, every function and template that file shares with the
    /// reference stops running — silently, with our copy still on disk, still commented, still
    /// read by the next session as if it were live.

    /// That is not a tidiness problem. Our copies DIVERGE from the reference deliberately, and the
    /// divergence is what dies: `UiPanels.xml`'s `PanelTemplates_TabResize` carried a benilla-only
    /// `return tabWidth` that the tab settle reads, and the reference's returns nothing.
    ///
    /// The reverse direction — ours seated BELOW the chain's, so we silently override the
    /// reference — is a real category too, and a wider audit than this gate.
