//! **The cinematic frame's key-down consumption** — what makes a fly-by something you *watch*.
//!
//! `CinematicFrame` is fullscreen, keyboard-enabled, and carries an `OnKeyDown` that answers
//! ESCAPE. In the reference that is enough to swallow **every** key while it is up, because the
//! key-down walk's gate is EXISTENCE, not handling (wow-re `ui/scratch/frame-key-script-delivery.md`
//! §3, VERIFIED): a shown keyboard frame with the slot set consumes the key whatever its script
//! does with it, and a 1.12 handler has no way to signal "not handled" (§3.1).
//!
//! The reference's own Lua is the proof, and it is why these tests exist: that same `OnKeyDown` has
//! to call `RunBinding("SCREENSHOT")` **by hand** to get one key back. It would not need to if
//! unhandled keys fell through to their bindings.
//!
//! benilla had the walk (decision 1319) but fed it only ten key names, so ESCAPE was consumed and
//! `W` was not — and the player could walk around underneath their own intro cinematic.
