//! layout, all engine-free) and feeds its [`extract`](benilla_ui::script::UiScript::extract) output
//! into the quad pass ([`crate::ui_pass::UiQuads`]) every frame. This is the seam decision 0068
//! draws between the engine-free crate and the app: everything above it is data + Lua; everything
//! below it is Bevy.
//!
//! Coordinates: the script/layout side is WoW UI space — **y-up**, origin bottom-left, in the
//! client's 768-virtual units (decision 0582): `set_screen_size` feeds a screen `768/uiScale`
//! units tall every frame, and [`seam_scale`] carries quads ×s out / mouse ÷s in. The quad pass
//! wants y-down window px, so extraction also flips through the window height.
//!
//! Benilla's own **unit frames** (`assets/ui/UnitFrames.xml` — a template + the player and target
//! instances) load at startup by default through [`benilla_ui::loader`] — the decision 0068 slice-1
//! game-shell: real FrameXML+Lua rendering unit health/power/level/name through the whole chain
//! (snapshot → `Unit*` bindings → Lua → event → StatusBars+text → quad pass). Since captures run
//! server-less (no real game state), `WOW_CAPTURE_UI=1` also feeds synthetic `"player"`/`"target"`
//! snapshots ([`demo_unit_feed`]) so the frames populate on screen. `FontString` regions draw
//! through [`crate::ui_text::layout_text_quads`] against the glyph atlas
//! [`crate::ui_text::UiFontAtlas`] builds at startup (decision 0068 §2).
