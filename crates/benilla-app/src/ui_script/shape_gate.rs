//! **The return-shape gate** — `reference/1.12-shapes.tsv` against what this client actually
//! answers (decision 1842).
//!
//! `reference_surface` compares `_G` to `_G`, so a wrong *name* cannot land. Nothing compared
//! *shapes*, and that gap produced six decisions in two days — 1818, 1819, 1830, 1834, 1836 and
//! 1840 — every one of them a right name with a wrong arity, invisible to every gate we had and
//! invisible to the chain's own files too, because a Lua caller that uses one value of two never
//! notices the second.
//!
//! **Arity is only half a shape.** A binding that answers the right *number* of values of the
//! wrong *kind* is the same silent break one level down, and it is the shape the 1.12 API is most
//! exposed to: the reference has no boolean-returning query at all — every `Is*`/`Can*`/`Has*` row
//! in the table is `(nil) | (number)`, because the client pushes `1` and `nil`, never `true` and
//! `false`. An addon writing `if IsShiftKeyDown() == 1` — and 87 corpus addons compare returns to
//! `1` — reads a `true` as "not held". So the kinds column is gated as well, wherever the table
//! says it is trustworthy (decision 2118).
//!
//! The table is wow-re's `re/audit/binding-shapes.tsv`, vendored: 1722 rows over all 82 registrar
//! tables, one per registered binding, generated and differentially tested against that repo's
//! other harvester. It carries the gate rule **per row** rather than in prose, which is the whole
//! reason it can be enforced instead of remembered:
//!
//! * `arity_conf = exact` — sound. This is the column to gate on.
//! * `kinds_conf = agree` — the row's independent `lua_push*` trace matched `eax` at every `ret`,
//!   which is the table's own statement that the kinds are trustworthy. Gated too, by
//!   [`every_query_binding_answers_the_reference_s_return_kinds`]; a row that did not agree is
//!   advisory and this module never reads its kinds at all.
//! * `argc_conf` — **never** gate on it. It is a deliberate over-flagging superset: any binding
//!   whose direct callee reads a Lua index is marked `lower-bound`, so a `lower-bound` row says
//!   nothing about the real argument count.
//!
//! ## Two things that make this narrower than it looks, both on purpose
//!
//! **Only query-shaped names are probed.** The gate calls each binding to count what it answers,
//! and calling an arbitrary global for its arity would mean calling `AbandonQuest`, `Quit` and
//! `AcceptBattlefieldPort` for theirs. Names are filtered to the query verbs — `Get*`, `Is*`,
//! `Has*`, `Can*`, `Unit*`, `Num*` — which is a loss of coverage, never a wrong assertion.
//!
//! **A call that raises is skipped, not failed.** A raise says nothing about arity, so only a call
//! that *returns* is measured. That rule used to cost the whole unit surface: the unit bindings
//! gate their token and raise on a nil one (1834/1836), so a no-argument probe threw for every one
//! of them, and the 62 `Unit*` rows this table calls `arity_conf = exact` were silently
//! uncovered — the gap named in this doc and never priced. The probe now **seats a player** and
//! calls `Unit*` with a real token, which took coverage from **220 bindings to 249**. All 29 newly
//! measured agreed with the reference on the first run; the value here is that they cannot drift
//! away from it unnoticed, not that anything was found wrong. The remainder still raise, needing
//! state a seated body does not supply, and are still skipped.
//!
//! ## The name is not a key
//!
//! **60 names are registered from more than one table and 21 differ in arity across
//! registrations** — `GetBuildInfo` is arity 5 in the glue table `0x8373b8` and 3 in the in-game
//! core `0x83de68`; `GetAddOnInfo` is 8 and 7. This VM is the in-game one, so a name carrying rows
//! from both is read at its **non-glue** row, and a name whose remaining rows still disagree is
//! skipped rather than guessed at.
//!
//! That hazard is the reason the table is keyed on `fn` upstream, and it is a live merge hazard for
//! `1.12-globals.tsv`, which is name-keyed.

/// It does not transfer to the base library, and the reason is worth stating rather than

///
