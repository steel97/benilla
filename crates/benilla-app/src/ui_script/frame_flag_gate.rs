//! **The reference's frame FLAGS are the test oracle** — the flag half of decision 0675's "the
//! reference file is the test oracle", and the gate for the class decision 1739 closed.
//!
//! `framexml_diff` guards the *numbers* a transcribed window carries. Nothing guarded its *flags*,
//! and they went quietly wrong at scale: on 2026-08-30 a sweep found **47 frames** the reference
//! marks `toplevel` and ours did not (so no window ever came to the front), **23** the reference
//! makes mouse-interactive and ours did not (so a click on a window's own background fell through
//! to the 3D world), and **81** carrying a reference `id=` ours dropped (so `GetID()` — the
//! contract every 1.12 addon reads a slot index out of — answered 0). Every gate was green
//! throughout, because a flag is invisible to a behavioural test that never presses on the frame.
//!
//! ## Two properties make this a guard rather than a comfort
//!
//! **Our side is read from the ENGINE, never from our XML.** An attribute-vs-attribute diff is
//! precisely what let the class hide, twice over: benilla renames templates (`ChatFrameTemplate` →
//! `BenillaChatFrameTemplate`), so a name-keyed text diff reports a gap of zero on a window that is
//! entirely missing the flag; and the `<Scripts>` **auto-enable** law (wow-re
//! `ui/scratch/scripts-auto-enable.md` §1, VERIFIED — an `<OnEnter>`/`<OnLeave>`/`<OnMouseDown>`/
//! `<OnMouseUp>`/`<OnDragStart>` reaches the same enable primitive `0x76af00(2,-1)` the attribute
//! does) makes `enableMouse=` a poor proxy for whether the frame actually takes the mouse. Asking
//! the loaded engine — `IsToplevel()`, `IsMouseEnabled()`, `GetID()`, `GetParent()` — is immune to
//! both, and to a third: a `parent=` can arrive from a template or from nesting, and `GetParent()`
//! answers the same whichever way it came.
//!
//! **Divergences are an explicit list with a reason each, never a pattern.** [`KNOWN`] carries
//! them, in both directions; a new one cannot hide inside a tolerance. The list is where the
//! seven frames the reference makes interactive through *handlers we do not carry* are recorded —
//! those want the handler (and its tooltip), never a bare `enableMouse="true"` that would swallow
//! the click and give nothing back.
//!
//! ## Four flags, and only four
//!
//! `toplevel`, the effective mouse enable, `id` and the **parent** are mechanical: the reference's
//! value is right for any frame we transcribe, and a difference is a defect. The neighbours are
//! **not**, and are deliberately out of scope rather than silently tolerated — `movable` is an
//! inert flag for all but two reference frames (nothing calls `StartMoving` on the rest, so
//! copying it would be cargo-cult), `frameStrata` decides what draws over what and is the
//! director's call, `setAllPoints` has an exact `<Size>`+`<Anchors>` equivalent that five of our
//! pages deliberately use, and `hidden` is equivalent whenever the reference hides in `OnLoad`
//! instead. Decision 1739 carries the reasoning per attribute.
//!
//! **The parent joined them at decision 1757, and it is the flag with teeth.** Until 1734 restored
//! `SetFullScreenFrame`'s `UIParent:Hide()`, a `parent=` was little more than a coordinate space;
//! after it, the seat decides whether a frame can be on screen *at all* while a fullscreen panel
//! is up. 1734 swept the direction it went looking for — 72 declarations the reference has and we
//! had dropped — and nothing asked the opposite question, so the frames we parent that the
//! reference leaves top-level went the other way in silence: opening the world map hid the map's
//! own blackout (the 3D world came back through the margins beside the 4:3 sheet — the director
//! reported it), the shared dropdown lists could not open over it, and the screenshot
//! confirmation could not appear during the fly-by whose SCREENSHOT key `CinematicFrame` hands
//! back by name. A gate that reads one direction of a two-directional property is a gate someone
//! has to remember to run backwards.
//!
//! Both ways a frame acquires a parent count, because the XML makes them look unrelated: the
//! `parent=` attribute — **on the element or on a template it inherits**, which is where the
//! reference keeps the chat frames' — and nesting inside another frame's `<Frames>`. Reading only
//! instances reports all fourteen chat frames as top-level; reading only attributes reports
//! `ScreenshotStatus` as parentless when the reference nests it in `WorldFrame` for the property
//! `WorldFrame.xml`'s header states outright: *"Children of the world frame are visible even when
//! the UI is turned off."*
//!
//! ## What it can and cannot see
//!
//! The population is the shipped tree's **named, published frames**, so a virtual template is not
//! compared directly — but every instance of one is, carrying the template's resolved flags, which
//! is the same coverage by a different route (a `KNOWN` entry naming a template therefore reads as
//! stale and is refused).
//!
//! The reference side is **XML only**: a `SetID` or `EnableMouse` the reference makes from Lua at
//! `OnLoad` is invisible here and reads as absent. That blind spot only ever under-reports — it
//! can hide a divergence, never invent one — so nothing it misses turns into a false failure; the
//! handful of frames it does hide are in `KNOWN` with that reason.
//!
//! The whole module skips cleanly with no install — `_extracted_framexml/` is a gitignored
//! Blizzard asset, like every other client-data test here.
