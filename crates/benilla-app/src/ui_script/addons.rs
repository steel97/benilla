//! **Where interfaces come from** — the addon folder, and the walk that loads what is in it
//! (decision 1184, building 1178 step 2).
//!
//! 1178 step 1 made benilla's own interface load from a `.toc`. This is the other half of the
//! claim: the same parser, the same loader, and the same walk now run over folders that are not
//! ours. An [`Addon`] is a name, a parsed manifest, and a [`Source`] its files come from — and
//! benilla's own interface is simply the one whose source is the compiled-in tree.
//!
//! ## Where we look — ONE folder
//!
//! **`<benilla-config>/AddOns/<Name>/<Name>.toc`**, and nothing else (decision 1185). 1184 also
//! searched the WoW install's own `Interface/AddOns/` and merged the two; the director's call is
//! one root, changeable in future *by choice* but never both at once. Resolved through
//! [`crate::local_state`], the only module allowed to compute that path (0954), which is already
//! `None` under `$WOW_CAPTURE` — so a capture discovers nothing and a deterministic baseline
//! cannot depend on what somebody has installed (0008).
//!
//! What the install's folder actually holds, checked rather than assumed: twelve `Blizzard_*`
//! folders containing **only a `.pub` signature file** — their real code is inside the MPQs, which
//! we do not read for addons at all — plus whatever the machine's owner has put there. Nothing was
//! being gained by searching it.
//!
//! ## Two kinds of file in a manifest
//!
//! A `.toc` lists `.lua` **and** `.xml`, and they load differently: Lua is executed as a chunk in
//! the shared global state, FrameXML is parsed and materialized. See [`Addon::load_files`].
//!
//! ## The load order is the reference's, not a topological sort
//!
//! `AddOn_Load 0x51f240` is **recursive**, and wow-5875-re has it byte-verified
//! (`system/ui/ui.md`, the SavedVariables §5 quad): for each addon, in order —
//! **OptionalDeps first (failures ignored)** → **RequiredDeps (a failure ABORTS this addon's
//! load)** → **its own `.toc`-listed files, in listed order**. We match that shape, because a
//! pre-sorted flat list cannot express "a missing hard dependency drops exactly this addon and
//! nothing else".
//!
//! **Our own interface is not an addon for lifecycle purposes.** The same source records that
//! *FrameXML does not go through `AddOn_Load`, so it gets no `ADDON_LOADED`* — and `benilla.toc`
//! is excluded exactly as FrameXML is. Structurally, not by a filter: it loads through
//! [`super::manifest::load_ingame_ui`], while [`Walk`] only ever walks what [`discover`] found.
//! It shares the loader; it does not share the event.
//!
//! ## Per-addon `Bindings.xml`
//!
//! Loaded right after the `.toc` files and before the saved variables (`0x51f400`) — 1188 phase 4,
//! in [`Walk::load`]. Parsed by [`benilla_ui::bindings_xml`] and registered into the same
//! key-binding table the Key Bindings window edits, so an addon's binding is a row like any
//! other; the app's dispatch runs its Lua body ([`crate::bindings`]).

///
/// So there is no order to copy, and exactly one order worth choosing: **NTFS's**. It is the order
/// every 1.12 install actually walked in, because that is the filesystem the client shipped on, and
/// it is therefore the order the whole vanilla addon corpus was written and tested against. A
/// directory's `$I30` index is a B-tree sorted by collation rule `COLLATION_FILE_NAME`, which
/// compares UTF-16 code units after mapping each through the volume's `$UpCase` table, and breaks a
/// case-insensitive tie with a case-sensitive compare of the raw units. Documented in ntfs-3g's
/// `layout.h`/`unistr.c` (`ntfs_names_full_collate`); Microsoft's `FindNextFileW` remarks say the
/// order is not *guaranteed* but that NTFS returns names "usually in alphabetical order", and
/// Raymond Chen's *"Why do NTFS and Explorer disagree on filename sorting?"* names it an ordinal
/// compare over the format-time case table rather than a locale collation.
///
/// **This is the whole difference from the `names.sort()` it replaces, and it is not cosmetic.**
/// Byte order sorts every uppercase name before every lowercase one and puts `_` between them;
/// NTFS folds case away and puts `_` after `Z`. On the 219-addon vanilla corpus **153 of the 219
/// positions move** — `Fubar_*` interleaves with `FuBar_*` instead of following it wholesale,
/// `oRA2` climbs 31 places, `zBar` overtakes `Zorlen`, and `_LazyPig`/`_Nameplates` fall from the
/// middle to dead last. Since the client runs every addon in one Lua state and adds no versioning
/// (wow-re §9: *which provider of a shared library wins is exactly "whichever addon's files run
/// last"*), that reshuffle decides which copy of `Tablet-2.0` a corpus of seventy providers ends up
/// with.
///
/// The corpus corroborates the mechanism from the other side: the `!`-prefix convention
/// (`!OmniCC`) only ever bought an addon an early slot because the walk was **name-collated**
/// rather than creation-ordered — which is what NTFS does and FAT/exFAT do not.
///
/// **We sort rather than take `read_dir`'s word even on Windows**, deliberately. Raw host order
/// would be byte-identical to a reference install on NTFS and arbitrary everywhere else, and it
/// would cost three things we need: a capture baseline that cannot depend on the host
/// (`crate::local_state`, 0008), [`installed`]'s contract that back-to-back reads answer the same
/// rows in the same order, and a corpus harness whose `--diff` means anything (2166 §4 already

/// one the corpus grew up under.
///
