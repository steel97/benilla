//! **The bottom-of-screen clearance law, enforced** (decision 1499).
//!
//! The bottom band of the screen is shared: the main bar sits on it, the extra action bars, the
//! stance/pet bar and the reputation watch bar stack above it, and the bag windows, the cast bar,
//! the chat panes and the default tooltip anchor all have to keep clear of whatever is standing.
//! `UIParent_ManageFramePositions()` (UIParent.xml) is the ONE thing that decides that — it seats
//! the managed frames and writes the managed globals — and every one of the defects below was a
//! frame that quietly opted out of it.
//!
//! Three guards, each pinning a different way to opt out:
//!
//! 1. [`no_shipped_file_declares_its_own_copy_of_a_managed_offset`] — the *shadow copy*.
//!    `BagFrame.xml` kept `local BENILLA_CONTAINER_OFFSET_X/Y = 0/70`. Locals, so the pass's
//!    writes could never reach them; the open-bag stack sat at the no-bars corner forever and a
//!    raised bottom multibar drew straight through the lowest bag window (director-caught — the
//!    screenshot that opened 1499). `GameTooltip.xml` carried the softer `X = X or 0` form of the
//!    same thing. A value with two written statements has no owner.
//!
//! 2. [`every_bottom_anchored_top_level_frame_is_accounted_for`] — the *new frame nobody wired
//!    up*. This is the guard that has to hold for features that do not exist yet: a top-level
//!    frame anchored to the screen's bottom edge is, by construction, in the contested band, so it
//!    must be a managed row, a listener consumer, or an exemption someone wrote a reason for.
//!
//! 3. [`no_bottom_band_frame_overlaps_a_raised_bar`] — the *symptom itself*, over the real shipped
//!    XML: for every combination of raised bars, no bottom-band frame's rect may intersect a
//!    visible bar's. This is the one that would have failed on the director's screenshot.
