//! **What the host remembers about the VM, and how it forgets.**
//!
//! The UI VM does not live for the process — it is built at world entry and destroyed at the
//! character screen, once per login (decision 1290, the reference's `0x48fbf0` ↔ `0x490bd0`). That
//! makes every host-side "I already told the VM about this" a claim with an expiry date, and there
//! are two kinds of them:
//!
//! - **seeds** — a registry, a catalog, a keybinding set: pushed once, because pushing it is
//!   expensive and its content does not change. A `bool` latch, or a `PostStartup` system, which is
//!   the same latch written in the scheduler.
//! - **change memos** — "these are the action slots I last pushed", so an unchanged frame costs
//!   nothing. A `Local<FeedMemory>`, near-universally.
//!
//! Both are *correct* against one VM and *silently wrong* against the next, and the failure has no
//! error path: the push simply does not happen, and the window is empty. Session 2's action bar,
//! bags, spellbook, keybinds and macros all failed exactly this way, and one of them — the CVar
//! table — failed worse than empty: `save_config` composes `config.toml` from the VM's snapshot, so
//! an unseeded VM would have written the player's settings file back out **stripped**.
//!
//! [`VmMemo`] is the one mechanism for both. It keys the memory on
//! [`UiScript::session`] — a VM-side identity, not a host-side counter someone must remember to
//! bump — so a memory written against a dead VM cannot be read at all. The failure mode inverts:
//! forgetting to use it is visible (the memo is a plain `Local` again), while using it and being
//! wrong costs one redundant push per login.
