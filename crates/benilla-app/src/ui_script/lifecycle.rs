//! **The UI session's lifecycle** — the VM's birth, its identity, its death, and the reload
//! (decisions 1051/1290/1291). Split from `mod.rs` when the reload verb landed and the file held
//! two concerns: this, and the per-frame extract/input bridge that stayed behind.
//!
//! The shape, end to end: `Startup` installs a **boot VM** (strings, emote tokens, fonts — the
//! state the glue screens run against); entering the world loads the in-game UI and every addon
//! onto it under the picked character's identity; leaving the world runs the reference's ordered
//! shutdown tail and installs a fresh boot VM; and `ReloadUI()` is the two edges back to back
//! without leaving the world. Every function here is an edge — nothing per-frame lives here.

///
/// ONLY the font-object registry at boot (1051). The glyph atlas bakes once, on the first `Update`,

/// has to exist before the login screen or in-game text loses its outlined variants and its
/// registry-declared sizes for the whole session. The other 55 files are in-game UI and load at
/// world entry ([`load_ingame_ui`]); the reference splits at exactly this seam, with GlueXML
/// carrying its own `GlueFonts.xml`.
///
/// **Since 1290 this runs per login, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental.** The
/// reference re-loads `Fonts.xml` on every rebuild and *must*: `0x48fbf0`'s toc loop has no
