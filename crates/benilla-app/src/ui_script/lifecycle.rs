//! The shape, end to end: `Startup` installs a **boot VM** (strings, emote tokens, fonts — the
//! state the glue screens run against); entering the world loads the in-game UI and every addon

/// cascade call at `0x490168` is gated on an active-player GUID that is still 0/0 on a fresh login
/// (see [`finish_ui_init`]). The conclusion survives, on four independent structural grounds, all
/// re-verified in wow-5875-re:
///
/// - World entry is a **category-5** callee (`0x420d63`), dispatched after the same iteration's
///   **category-6** inbound drain (`0x420d55`) has already returned.
/// - A nested drain is impossible: the drain's container `0x420c00` is entered **once per
///   process**, so no unresolved indirect call inside the load can re-enter it.
/// - Reception is decoupled — the socket threads only **enqueue** (`0x537b7c`); handlers run only
///   from the main-thread drain. `SMSG_PONG` (`0x1dd`, inline at `0x537b56`) is the single bypass
///   in the image, and it carries no game state.
/// - The client does not even **send** the login request until a later frame (`0x46c272`), gated on
///   the async loads being idle — i.e. not until the UI is up.
///
/// So the real client cannot process world state without an interface, structurally, and our
/// deferred load is expressing that same property with a run condition. The first frame this
/// answers true on is a fresh, unlatched world, and the feed delivers the full set in order.
///
/// **TWO terms, because `not(ingame_ui_pending)` is only half of it** (B376). The latch is armed
/// at `OnEnter(InWorld)`, and that edge trails the wire by a frame: `apply_net_updates` drains
/// `Connected` and the whole login burst behind it in one `try_iter`, `enter_on_connected` sets
/// `NextState` from that same drain, and the transition — with it the park and the latch — does
/// not run until the NEXT frame's `StateTransition`. So for exactly one frame the client has
/// in-world wire state and a live *boot* VM, and 1978's park does not cover it. `InWorld` is the
/// term that does: the state flips on the same edge that arms the latch, so the pair is closed at
/// both ends. B376's guild MOTD was fired into that one frame (observed live, 1 login in 3);
