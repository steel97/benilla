//! Print screen's UI half (`assets/ui/ScreenshotStatus.xml`) against the shipped XML — and above
//! all **B261's third clause: the "Screen Captured" line must not be in the file it announces.**
//!
//! That contract is an ORDERING, so it is tested as one. Two paths could put text in a picture and
//! both are pinned here: the ordinary press (nothing is shown until the engine reports back, which
//! it can only do after the readback) and the double press inside the 1.5 s fade (the previous
//! shot's line is still up, and `TakeScreenshot` takes it down *before* asking).
