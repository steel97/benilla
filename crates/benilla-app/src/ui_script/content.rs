//! **The shipped UI's files, compiled into the binary** (decision 1175 §2).
//!
//! One question, one answer: *give me the text of `ui/<name>.xml`*. [`load_ui_files`] and the
//! `provider` closure it hands the loader (for `<Include>` / `<Script file=>` references) both ask
//! here instead of touching `std::fs`.
//!
//! Until 1175 they read `concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/assets/ui")` — the *build*
//! machine's source tree. On a player's machine every one of those files resolves to nothing and
//! the client boots with no interface at all: not a crash, just an empty screen and one log line
//! per manifest entry that nobody sees.
//! `assets/ui` is our own content (MIT/Apache, not Blizzard's — the contract's hard rule is
//! untouched), so it can simply be part of the program.
//!
//! ## Resolution order — the same in every build
//!
//! 1. **`#[cfg(feature = "dev")]`** — the crate's own `assets/ui/` on disk. Editing a FrameXML file
//!    and re-running still costs no recompile, which is the whole reason the source tree is worth
//!    probing at all. This is the only place a source path survives, and 1174's feature is what
//!    keeps it out of a player binary.
//! 2. **The compiled-in copy** — `include_dir!` over the same directory.
//!
//! A dev build therefore prefers disk and silently falls back to the embedded copy, so a file
//! deleted from `assets/ui` does not *appear* to still work: [`tests`] pins that the two agree.
//!
//! ## Why not the asset server
//!
//! [`super::manifest::MANIFEST`] is a **dependency-ordered** manifest loaded synchronously
//! at a known point (a template must exist before the frame that inherits it), and the asset server
//! is async. Serving these through it would mean re-deriving a dependency graph that a hand-ordered
//! list already encodes correctly. This stays a byte lookup.
//!
//! ## The override layer this is not
//!
//! A `content/` folder beside the executable — addon and content-pack territory — is deliberately
//! *not* built here (1175 "Rejected"), but the shape leaves room for it: it would be one more arm
//! at the front of [`read`]. Building it now would be a mod system with no mods.
