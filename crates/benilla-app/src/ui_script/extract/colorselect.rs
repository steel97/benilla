//! The colour picker's **generated art** — the hue disc and the brightness ramp.
//!
//! The reference's `<ColorWheelTexture>` and `<ColorValueTexture>` (`ColorPickerFrame.xml` l.186-221)
//! carry no `file=`, and that is not an oversight: there is no BLP anywhere in the 1.12 MPQ chain
//! that is a colour wheel. The client computes those pixels. The engine core therefore hands us the
//! rect and the widget's HSV ([`QuadContent::ColorWheel`]/[`QuadContent::ColorValue`]) and the
//! pixels are made here — the same division of labour the `<Minimap>` slot uses.
//!
//! **Both images are static**, which is why a live drag regenerates nothing: the disc does not
//! depend on the colour at all, and the strip is `rgb(h, s, 1)` times a fixed greyscale ramp
//! (`hsv_to_rgb` scales all three outputs by `v` and by nothing else, so `rgb(h, s, v)` really is
//! `v · rgb(h, s, 1)`).
//!
//! Everything below is byte-verified in wow-re's `system/ui/scratch/colorselect-drawn-appearance.md`
//! (a §5 cross-check dispatched from this repo for exactly this window: six workers in three pairs,
//! one of each briefed cold, plus the orchestrator's own contiguous derivation). What it settled,
//! and what each fact cost to get wrong:
//!
//! * **The disc is a 128×128 generated ARGB texture** (`0x78b580`, 16384 dwords into a
//!   function-local static, uploaded once per process), drawn unmodulated — not a vertex-coloured
//!   fan. It never reaches the gradient helper `0x77f910`.
//! * **It is drawn at `V = 1.0`, a `mov`-immediate (`0x78b68b mov [ebp-0x24],0x3f800000`), never
//!   the widget's `[this+0x330]`.** Lowering the brightness slider does not darken the wheel — the
//!   thumb moves and nothing else does. This file first shipped the opposite, as a flagged guess.
//! * **The texel lattice is integers**, `X, Y ∈ [−64, 63]`, drawn iff `X² + Y² ≤ 0x1000` —
//!   boundary *inclusive* — and outside is `0x00000000`, a hard alpha cut with no mask and no
//!   feathering. `S = √(X²+Y²)/64`; `H = (atan2(Y, X) + π)·180/π`, the exact inverse of the pick
//!   law (`colorselect-color-law.md` §5), which is what makes clicking a texel select the colour
//!   that texel shows. Row 0 is `Y = +63`: the top.
//! * **The strip is an 8×8 solid texture of `HSV(H, S, 1)` times a vertical vertex gradient**,
//!   black at the bottom and white at the top (`0x78b8a0` + `0x78b92a call 0x77f910`, and
//!   `0x7705b0` fixes the winding TL/BL/TR/BR). The product is `HSV(H, S, v)` at every row — so
//!   `V` moves no strip pixel either. We compute the same product the other way round, one static
//!   greyscale ramp times the hue tint, which is exact because **this pass composites in gamma
//!   bytes** (decision 0254): the quad's `color × texel` multiply *is* the client's.
