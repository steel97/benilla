//! The **feed gate** (decision 1439): the input-side early-out for a per-frame UI feed.
//!
//! Every VM feed is a rebuild-to-diff: build the fresh snapshot, compare against what was last
//! pushed, push only the difference. The diff half was always cheap; the REBUILD half runs every
//! frame whether or not any input moved, and on a parked frame none do — that waste is what 1435
//! priced and 1436 deferred to its own slice. The gate is the honest fix, not a cache bolted on:
//! the reference client pushes on *events* (its handlers run when a field-watch or a packet says
//! so), and an input-change gate is that same shape written in change detection.
//!
//! **The gate lives in the feed's body, never in a `run_if`.** A run condition is a second
//! parameter list that must mirror the system's own, and nothing ties them together — every
//! param added to the body without its condition twin is a silent stale-window bug. In the body,
//! the gate reads the very params it guards, beside their declarations, and the audit mode below
//! can check it.
//!
//! Three rules for writing one:
//!
//! 1. **Every input the body reads is in the gate.** `Res<T>::is_changed()` for plain resources;
//!    a [`Watch`] over the counter for the generation-counted stores (`Cooldowns`, `Items`,
//!    `NameCache`, `GuildState` — counted precisely because their lazy `&mut` resolves mark the
//!    resource changed every frame, poisoning `is_changed` for everyone); `Changed<T>`/
//!    `RemovedComponents<T>` queries for component inputs; an emptiness check for drained
//!    side-channels.
//! 2. **The VM reset is an input.** [`super::VmMemo::get_reset`]'s flag ORs in first: a fresh VM
//!    re-pushes with every other input unchanged (session.rs's whole failure class).
//! 3. **Evaluate every [`Watch`] unconditionally** (bind `let`s, then OR the bools): a `moved`
//!    short-circuited past doesn't observe its counter and would re-open the gate one frame
//!    late — harmless, but a cascade of them re-runs the feed for nothing, N frames deep.
//!
//! **The audit (`WOW_FEED_GATE_CHECK=1`)** is the validator that makes the pattern safe to
//! extend: a closed gate still runs its body, and any push the diff then finds is a missed
//! input — [`audit_push`] panics on the spot, naming the feed. A gate bug's natural form is a
//! window that goes stale until something else pokes it, which no capture and no test reliably
//! sees; the audit converts it into a crash in any probe leg that drives the state.
