//! **The VERB-FIRED event gate** — `reference/1.12-verb-events.tsv` against the module that
//! registers each verb (decision 2251).
//!
//! ## The third question on the event seam
//!
//! Two gates compare event NAMES (`reference_ui`: a stock listener nothing feeds, 1889; a fire the
//! reference has no name for, 1883) and one compares ARGUMENTS (`event_shape_gate`, 2140). None of
//! them asks **who** fires it, and that is the hole B389/2244 fell through. The reference's
//! `SetTrainerServiceTypeFilter` commits through `0x4d8c90`, whose whole body is *write the mask,
//! re-run the finalizer, fire `TRAINER_UPDATE`*; so the stock `Blizzard_TrainerUI.lua` never
//! repaints the list itself — it calls the verb for its side effect. benilla's verb set the mask
//! and fired nothing. The name gate stayed green because the packet arm fires the same event, and
//! the tests stayed green because they asserted the mask. Our own retired `TrainerFrame.xml` had
//! repainted explicitly, so the behaviour left with the file that was compensating for it (1957),
//! and the director found it twelve days later. Every window that went stock (1751) carries the
//! same exposure: a verb the stock Lua calls *for the event*.
//!
//! ## The rule
//!
//! For every pair the reference fires on the verb's own call path (the table: the verb's body, or
//! a helper that only registered verbs call), and every verb benilla registers: **a file that
//! registers the verb also fires the event** — or the pair is declared below, and the declaration
//! is *checked*, never trusted:
//!
//! * [`ELSEWHERE`] — benilla fires it from a named feed instead, on the state the verb changed
//!   (the verb bumps a generation, sets a touched flag, queues an intent the app drains). That
//!   file must fire it, and the verb's own file must not, or the row is stale.
//! * [`GAP`] — nothing fires it on this verb's path, for a stated reason. The verb's own file
//!   must still not fire it, or the row is stale.
//!
//! A verb no file registers is skipped: unbuilt verbs are `scripts/api-coverage.sh`'s queue
//! (1178), not this gate's.
//!
//! ## What "registers" and "fires" mean here, and the limit
//!
//! Text, not execution: the quoted literal `"Verb"` or `"EVENT"` in a non-test source file, with
//! comment lines dropped and the trailing test module cut. Lenient in exactly one direction — any
//! file that names the verb and fires the event passes — because the honest alternative, proving
//! the path *executes*, is a per-verb fixture, and 2244's own test is the measure of a fixture that
//! asserts the wrong thing. What this cannot see: a fire that is in the file but off the verb's
//! path — an `ELSEWHERE` row is a claim the session that wrote it read at the feed. What it sees
//! every time is the migration class itself: a verb whose module fires nothing.
