//! **benilla's own interface** — its manifest, and the boot split that loads it in two phases.
//!
//! The *how* of loading any interface lives in [`super::addons`]: an [`Addon`] is a name, a parsed
//! `.toc`, and a source its files come from, and ours is simply the one whose source is the
//! compiled-in tree (decision 1184). What is specific to us, and therefore still here, is the
//! **seam at index 0** — see [`load_default_ui`].
//!
//! The manifest itself is not here either. It is [`MANIFEST`] — `assets/ui/benilla.toc`, an
//! ordinary addon manifest read by the ordinary `.toc` parser ([`benilla_ui::toc`]), exactly as a
//! third-party addon's is (decision 1178). Until then it was a hand-ordered `&[&str]` in this file,
//! which meant our own interface loaded by a private door and the addon path was untested by
//! construction.
