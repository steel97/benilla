//! **The in-game interface** — its manifest, and the boot split that loads it in two phases.
//!
//! The *how* of loading any interface lives in [`super::addons`]: an [`Addon`] is a name, a parsed
//! `.toc`, and a source its files come from (decision 1184). What is specific to the default UI,
//! and therefore still here, is the **seam at index 0** — see [`load_default_ui`] — and the
//! **two sources one manifest names**, see [`load_manifest`].
//!
//! The manifest itself is not here either. It is [`MANIFEST`] — `assets/ui/benilla.toc`, an
//! ordinary addon manifest read by the ordinary `.toc` parser ([`benilla_ui::toc`]), exactly as a
//! third-party addon's is (decision 1178). Until then it was a hand-ordered `&[&str]` in this file,
//! which meant our own interface loaded by a private door and the addon path was untested by
//! construction.
//!
//! ## One ordered list, two stores (decision 1751)
//!
//! The end state for this interface is the stock 1.12 FrameXML run off the player's own install;
//! `assets/ui` is scaffolding that retires file by file ([`super::reference_ui`], whose header is
//! the rule). A manifest entry carrying a **path** is sourced off the chain, a **bare filename** is
//! one we ship — so the migration of a window is one line changing in `benilla.toc` plus the
//! deletion of our copy, and the manifest stays the single ordered truth of what loads when. That
//! ordering is the point: stock `ContainerFrame.xml` inherits four templates our earlier files
//! declare, so "source the reference first" — the only order a Lua-only mechanism could express —
//! is not a position it can load at.

/// fade completes, `oldAlpha` goes nil under a live hover, the plate arm (`chatFrame.oldAlpha
/// and chatFrame.oldAlpha < DEFAULT_CHATFRAME_ALPHA`, l.873) never passes again, and every later
/// leave skips the arm that would clear `hover` — so the hover-start re-read of `oldAlpha` (l.907)
/// never runs either. The tab keeps fading in; the plate never does, for the rest of the session.
/// `FCF_SetWindowAlpha` (the tab menu's opacity slider) reseats `oldAlpha` and is the one way
/// out, which is the shape the director reported: an existing window shows no plate on hover, a

/// (`FCF_SetButtonSide`, l.1038) and the hover box reaches only 5 (`MouseIsOver(chatFrame, 45,
