//! What a UI change costs on the **full shipped UI** — the headless twin of the live hover
//! recorder (`hover_log`), and the loop that made the tooltip-hover cost reproducible without a
//! play session.
//!
//! The live runs said a hover frame that ran the layout fixpoint cost ~10 ms against ~0.2 ms for
//! one that did not, but neither the synthetic tooltip probes nor the shipped `BagFrame.xml` hover
//! loop reproduced it: with content that does not MOVE, the change gate absorbs everything. The
//! missing ingredient is that a real hover sweep shows a *different item every frame* — line widths
//! that actually change. That is what [`tooltip_change_costs_a_whole_ui_solve`] drives, and with it
//! the cost reproduces headlessly and can be measured against a fix.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test --release -p benilla-app --lib -- --ignored --nocapture resolve_bench`;
//! `WOW_LAYOUT_PROF=1` adds the per-solve shape — and since decision 1350 its `solved=`/`swept=`
//! columns are the ones to read: they are the SCOPE of the solve, and 1350's whole claim is that
//! they stay a handful while `frames=`/`anchored=` grow without bound. A solve whose scope tracks
