//! The player-UI quad pass (decision 0068 §2): a custom sorted-quad renderer for the WoW-engine UI,
//! **not** `bevy_ui`'s flexbox/hierarchy z-model — probe B (2026-07-02) measured `bevy_ui` fighting the
//! WoW `(stratum, level, layer, sublayer, decl)` total order and chose a dedicated pass instead. This
//! module is the render **substrate** only: [`UiQuad`]/[`UiQuads`] is the data contract the future
//! widget arena (frames, `FontString`s, the anchor resolver) builds against — nothing here knows about
//! frames, strata, or Lua. A caller flattens its own ordering into `z_key: u64` (a WoW frame's
//! `(stratum, level, layer, sublayer, decl)` tuple packs into one `u64` losslessly) and this pass just
//! draws the resulting flat list back-to-front.
//!
//! ## Camera / compositing order (decision 0025)
//! Three cameras share the window, ordered low→high: the 3D world camera (order 0, untouched) → this
//! module's [`PlayerUiCamera`] (order 1) → the egui dev-overlay camera (bumped from 1 to 2 in
//! `debug_panel::spawn_egui_camera` — the one sanctioned edit outside this file). 0025 established
//! "dev overlays composite over a full-screen world"; this pass slots the *player* UI into that
//! ordering exactly where 0025 already reserved it ("where player-UI arbitration will live later") —
//! **dev overlays stay on top of the player UI, which stays on top of the world.** The camera renders
//! nothing from the 3D world (its own [`RenderLayers`] layer, disjoint from the world camera's default
//! layer 0) and composites over whatever the world camera already painted (`CameraOutputMode::Write`
//! with alpha blending, no clear — same pattern as the egui overlay camera).
//!
//! ## Colour space: the UI gamma composite lane (decision 0254)
//! The reference draws its whole UI through the fixed-function device into an 8-bit backbuffer, so
//! every UI multiply and every UI blend is arithmetic on **gamma bytes**, clamped at each write.
//! This pass reproduces that: [`UiQuad::color`] rides through unconverted, `ui_quad.wgsl` puts its
//! sampled texel back into byte space and premultiplies there, and the hardware blend composes in
//! gamma. [`crate::ui_gamma`] then decodes the finished image to linear exactly once, so the sRGB
//! target's write re-encodes it to the client's byte. This is the UI sibling of decision 0161's
//! world lane, whose one decode lives in the FFXGlow combine.
//!
//! Getting this wrong is not a subtlety: composited in linear, `alphaMode="ADD"` lands at roughly a
//! quarter of the reference's lift (sRGB's power law is superadditive, so a linear add is always
//! weaker than a byte add) — the near-invisible gossip/quest/trainer row highlight that forced 0254.
//!
//! ## Rendering approach
//! Quads are stable-sorted by `z_key` ascending (the WoW total order: lower key = further back). CPU
//! clip (an axis-aligned intersection against [`UiQuad::clip`], reprojecting UVs proportionally) is
//! applied per quad; a quad clipped to nothing emits no geometry. The sorted, clipped list is then
//! split into **contiguous runs of matching texture identity** (texture-less quads use a shared 1×1
//! white image, so they participate in the same run-splitting as textured ones) — each run becomes one
//! `Mesh2d`/`ColorMaterial` entity. Painter's order within a run comes from vertex/index submission
//! order in the single draw call (straight-alpha blending composites strictly in submission order, no
//! depth test); painter's order **across** runs comes from each run's entity `Transform.z` — Bevy's 2D
//! transparent phase sorts draws by ascending world-space z (`bevy_sprite_render`'s
//! `mesh2d::material::queue_material2d_meshes`), so runs are placed at increasing z in the same order
//! they appear in the sorted quad list. This is what makes the *contiguous-run* choice load-bearing
//! rather than a pure optimization: batching is scoped to a run, not deduped globally by texture, so
//! the total order holds **even when two quads share a texture but something else is sandwiched
//! between them in z_key** — that in-between quad still forces a run break, so the shared texture ends
//! up in two (or more) separate draw calls rather than one. The batching consequence: UI content that
//! interleaves textures frequently in z-order (e.g. icon, text, icon, text, …) pays one draw call per
//! transition instead of the two-call minimum a global per-texture dedup would give — correctness over
//! draw-call count. A texture atlas is the standard fix (turns "different texture" into "different UV
//! rect on one atlas", collapsing runs) and is a natural extension once the widget arena needs it.
//!
//! ## Explicitly out of scope (v1)
//! - **Real scissor rects.** [`UiQuad::clip`] is a CPU stand-in (rebuild-time geometry clip); a
//!   `ScrollFrame`-driven GPU scissor rect (per 0068 §2, "per-ScrollFrame scissor rects") is a later
//!   render-pass change, not a data-contract change — `clip` can stay as an escape hatch for the rare
//!   non-rectangular-region case even after real scissor lands.
//! - **Text.** `FontString`s render through `cosmic-text` per 0068 §2; nothing here rasterizes glyphs.
//! - **Extraction from a widget arena.** Nothing yet *produces* [`UiQuad`]s from frames/anchors/strata —
//!   that's the widget-arena milestone this pass is built ahead of. The `dev`-gated demo feeder below
//!   fills [`UiQuads`] directly to prove the pass in isolation.
