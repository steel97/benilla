//! The **equip / auto-equip / use soulbind confirmations** — `EQUIP_BIND`, `AUTOEQUIP_BIND` and
//! `USE_BIND` (decision 1750). The loot arm's siblings, and NOT built the same way, because the
//! reference does not build them the same way either.
//!
//! ## The three predicates are three different predicates
//!
//! VERIFIED at the 1.12.1 bytes (wow-re `system/object-layer/scratch/bind-confirm-law.md`), one
//! `item_template + 0x194` compare per arm and **no `+0x1c` (quality) read in any of the three**:
//!
//! | arm | event | fires from | predicate | site |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | loot (decision 1744) | `LOOT_BIND_CONFIRM` 287 | `0x4c2790` | `bonding == 1` **and** `quality >= 2` | `4c28f2`/`4c28fb` |
//! | equip | `EQUIP_BIND_CONFIRM` 288 | `0x5e0c40` `SwapItem` | `bonding == 2` | `5e0e54` |
//! | auto-equip | `AUTOEQUIP_BIND_CONFIRM` 289 | `0x5e1480` `AutoEquipCursorItem` | `bonding == 2` | `5e163b` |
//! | use | `USE_BIND_CONFIRM` 290 | `0x5d8d00` `CGItem::Use` | `bonding == 3` | `5d91d6` |
//!
//! Carrying the loot arm's `quality >= 2` across would have been wrong twice over: it would have
//! silenced the confirm on a white BoE, and it would have asked about the wrong `bonding` value
//! entirely. (This was benilla's working assumption until the RE refuted it; that is why the table
//! is here and not a sentence.)
//!
//! ## The other conjuncts, and where benilla already had them
//!
//! The equip arms' full set is: container and item resolve · the item is **not already soulbound**
//! · the call is not itself a suppressed re-issue · the item template is **cached** · `bonding == 2`
//! · the player **can equip it**. Both of the interesting ones were already in this codebase, byte-
//! derived for other reasons and reused here rather than re-written:
//!
//! - *not already soulbound* is [`crate::items::already_bound`] — literally `0x5da2c0`, built for
//!   the enchant cursor's own bind question (decision 0928) and the tooltip's Soulbound override
//!   (B310/1562). The reference calls the same function from all three places.
//! - *can equip it* is `0x5ea930`, [`benilla_ui::script::UiScript::item_usable`] — built for the
//!   merchant's red rows (decision 0299).
//!
//! ## Accept is a re-issue, not a confirm packet
//!
//! There is no `CMSG_CONFIRM_*` in 1.12. `EquipPendingItem(index)` re-runs the *original action*
//! with the suppress flag set, which is why [`PendingEquip`] stores the action's own coordinates
//! and the accept path calls the very same sender the click did — `suppress` threaded through as a
//! real parameter, exactly as `0x5e0c40`/`0x5e1480` take it. `CancelPendingEquip(index)` sends
//! nothing and only drops the record.
//!
//! **A superseded record is CANCELLED, not overwritten** — the entries are `exclusive = 1`, so
//! `StaticPopup_Show` hides the standing dialog and runs its `OnHide`, which is
//! `CancelPendingEquip(slot)`. That is why both `OnCancel` and `OnHide` name it, and why this store
//! is an index-addressed array of optional records rather than a single cell: two questions can be
//! live in principle, and the second one's arrival is what retires the first.
//!
//! ## The index space is the reference's own
//!
//! `arg1` is a **0-based index into the pending array**, not a slot (wow-re corrected benilla's
//! assumption here). It is opaque on both sides — the event hands it out, `dialog.data` carries it,
//! and the two verbs hand it straight back — so unlike the loot arm's row number (1744, translated
//! into benilla's display space) there is nothing to gain by re-basing it, and it is kept as-is.
