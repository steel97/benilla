//! The reputation pane's app half: resolve the player's wire reputation slots against
//! `Faction.dbc`, push the flat snapshot into the VM's reputation seam
//! ([`benilla_ui::script::ReputationState`]), fire `UPDATE_FACTION` on a change, and drain the
//! pane's three outbound verbs back onto the wire.
//!
//! The seam's module doc (`benilla-ui`'s `script::reputation`) is the display law; this file is the
//! **data** law it consumes, and there are exactly three pieces of it:
//!
//! 1. **Which factions are rows.** A `Faction.dbc` row participates iff it has a reputation slot
//!    (`reputationIndex >= 0`) **and at least one of its four race/class mask slots fits the
//!    player** — the client's own membership gate at `0x4d5555`, where the add call sits inside the
//!    accept block of the same loop that picks the base value. Whether the pane then *lists* it is
//!    the single flag `VISIBLE`, off until the player first meets them — which is why
//!    `SMSG_SET_FACTION_VISIBLE` has to be applied (`net::apply::session::reputation_visible`).
//!
//!    **Unlisted factions are pushed anyway, carrying `visible: false`.** They are how the pane's
//!    headers learn their names: all five header factions carry `HEADER` (`0x08`) and only one of
//!    them carries `VISIBLE` as well, so filtering on visibility would group the tree correctly and
//!    then label every header with an empty string.
//! 2. **The standing.** The wire standing EXCLUDES the DBC race/class base value; the total the
//!    pane ranks is `base_for(race, class) + wire`. Verified on the server side, which is the side
//!    that authors both numbers: vmangos stores `faction.Standing = standing - BaseRep`
//!    (`ReputationMgr::SetOneFactionReputation`) and reports
//!    `GetBaseReputation(entry) + state->Standing` (`GetReputation`).
//! 3. **The rank window.** [`benilla_formats::reputation_rank`] ranks the total on the 0..=7 scale
//!    (shared with the unit-reaction decode, so the pane and the nameplate can never disagree); the
//!    absolute floor/ceiling of that rank are [`RANK_BOUNDS`] — byte-for-byte the client's own
//!    `.rdata` table at `0x80928c`. The Lua tuple's `standingID` is the rank plus one.
//!
//! And one flag reading that is easy to get wrong and was: **`0x08` is `HEADER`, not
//! "force-invisible"** — see `benilla_formats::faction_flags`. `canToggleAtWar` is
//! `!PEACE_FORCED && standing >= -3000`; the client's toggle enforces more than it reports, but the
//! extra conditions (in combat, and the floor applying only toward peace) are the app's to add if
//! the pane ever needs them.
