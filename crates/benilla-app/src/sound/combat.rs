//! Combat audio (decisions 0075 + 0525): the melee swing's sounds — the whoosh and exertion on
//! their own event tags, the CONTACT family on the victim dispatch ([`SwingImpact`]).
//!
//! The trigger chain: `SMSG_ATTACKERSTATEUPDATE` → [`SwingMessage`] (net bridge; also drives the
//! swing *animation*, decision 0073) → the attack sequence's M2 events fire mid-swing through
//! [`AnimSoundEvent`]. Two tags route directly from that stream:
//!
//! - **`$CSS`** — the swing whoosh, in **both** of its forms. Nothing contacted (miss/dodge/
//!   evade) gets kits 7080/7081 `Combat Miss 1H/2H` by weapon handedness — exactly the two ids
//!   the client caches by name at startup (wow-re `0x4575b0`, `_DONOTRENAME_` kits). Anything
//!   else gets the *connecting* swing's `WeaponSwingSounds2` whoosh by weapon weight; see "The
//!   connecting swing" below.
//! - **`$CAH`** — **not** the attacker's exertion, which is what this module used to think.
//!   `$CAH` drives the **victim's** injury vocal (`0x624865 je 0x624902` → `0x6249bb call
//!   0x624530`), which benilla already fires off that crossing; there is no `call [reg+0x88]`
//!   anywhere in `0x6247d0`, so the tag never reaches the exertion columns at all.
//!
//! The **attacker's exertion** is packet-driven at swing start, and is now wired that way
//! (`SMSG_ATTACKERSTATEUPDATE` → `0x6246a0` → `0x624786` → `0x623b10`). Read off the bytes:
//!
//! - `class = ([hitrec+0x10] >> 7) & 1` — the crit bit, so `Exertion` / `ExertionCritical`.
//! - `0x62476a`: gated on **`victimState != 0`**, and only on that. (The earlier note here also
//!   claimed a victim-health gate; `0x6246a0` contains no such test. Its other two bails —
//!   `[[attacker+0x110]+0x40] <= 0` at `0x6246b1` and `hitInfo & 0x10000` at `0x6246c2` — sit
//!   above the swing *animation* select as well, so they belong to that subsystem, not here.)
//! - `force = 0` (`0x62477e`), so the **class chance roll applies**: threshold 70 for a creature
//!   and 35 for a player on class 0, 100 on class 1. A crit always grunts; an ordinary swing
//!   grunts ~70 % of the time for a creature and ~36 % for a player.
//!
//! This moves *when* a grunt is heard — swing start rather than mid-clip — and thins ordinary
//! swings out, which the tag-driven version never did.
//!
//! The **contact family** consumes [`SwingImpact`] — the victim dispatch `0x624530` + the
//! `0x6247d0` weapon-sound block, fired at the swing clip's **`$AH0–3`/`$CAH`** crossing, or at
//! receive for an unresolved attacker (decision 0529; previously keyed on `$HIT`, a CEffect-only
//! tag many creature attack clips never author — ogre.m2 authors it in 1 of its ~14 attack
//! variations, so ogre hits were near-silent):
//!
//! It is **two blocks in the client's order**, not one pick (decision 0899):
//!
//! 1. `0x6247d0`'s own weapon-sound block, at the attacker — a **natural-weapon** swing
//!    (`$AHn` fired the dispatch) plays the attacker's `CreatureSoundData.CustomAttack[n]`
//!    column INSTEAD of the generic weapon impact (the `SWINGNOHITSOUND` latch, `0x6247d0` §f);
//!    otherwise a landed hit plays the `WeaponImpactSounds` impact/crit slot for the victim's
//!    material (`CreatureImpactType`).
//! 2. `0x624530`'s **victimState-keyed clang**, at the victim — parry (`0x6245bb` →
//!    `0x623640(sel=0)`) takes the attacker row's parry slot (metal/wood by the victim's
//!    weapon), block (`0x6245d8` → `sel=1`) the shield slot. This block is reached on **every**
//!    impact tag: the `$AHn` digit block "has zero effect on the victim dispatch", so a beast's
//!    bite and the parry clang both sound.
//!
//! Plus the victim's injury vocal (`Injury`/`InjuryCritical`/`InjuryCrushing`) on every
//! damaging, undefended hit.
//!
//! A `text_only` flush (supersede/attack-stop) drops its sounds — only the floating number
//! flushes (decision 0149's flush law, inherited from the shared dispatch).
//!
//! ## The connecting swing — the other half of `$CSS` (decision 1567)
//!
//! `$CSS` is **two** sounds, not one, and `0x624ca0` picks between them off the victimState
//! alone: `{0 unaffected, 2 dodge, 6 evade}` take the by-handedness miss whoosh, and **every
//! other outcome — a landed hit, a parry, a block, an immune, a deflect — takes
//! `WeaponSwingSounds2` on the capped bus 6** ([`whiffed`]). benilla voiced only the first half
//! until 1567, so every landed melee swing in the game was missing a sound.
//!
//! What blocked it was `0x623870`, the `swingType` source, read now: it is **not a heuristic**.
//! The function asks the swinging hand (`hitInfo & LEFTSWING` picks which) for its item, requires
//! item class 2, and returns `ItemSubClass[(2, subclass)]` field 9 — `WeaponSwingSize`, a shipped
//! DBC column ([`swing_weight`]). The shipped weapon rows put daggers and fist weapons at Light,
//! every two-hander plus polearms, staves and spears at Heavy, and the rest at Medium; an **empty
//! hand returns Light** (`0x623892` writes 0 and returns *true*) and a **non-weapon in hand
//! returns false**, i.e. silence. The kit is then `cache[critical + weight*2]` over the six
//! `WeaponSwingSounds2` rows — 233..238, `mWooshSmall/Medium/Large` — at volume 0.5 when the hit
//! flags carry `HITINFO_MISS` and 1.0 otherwise (`0x457f74`/`0x457f7d`).
//!
//! One benilla behaviour changed beyond the new sound: immune and deflect used to take the *miss*
//! whoosh here, because this branch borrowed [`no_contact`] — the impact family's wider question.
//! `0x624ca0` reads neither the hit flags nor those two states, so they now whoosh like the
//! contacts they are.
//!
//! ## The victim dispatch's tail, read out (1567)
//!
//! `0x624530` past the clang is a four-way ladder, and two of its arms were silent here:
//!
//! - **deflect** (victimState 8) plays a fixed `(DONOTRENAME)ShieldWoodImpact`, id 3262
//!   ([`DEFLECT_KIT`]) — not a weapon-row slot.
//! - **absorb, resist or immune** (`hitInfo & 0x60`, or victimState 7) plays
//!   `(DONOTRENAME)AbsorbGetHit`, id 3334 ([`ABSORB_KIT`]), **instead of** the wound vocal —
//!   it returns before reaching it.
//! - otherwise the wound vocal, keyed crushing → critical → (`MISS` → nothing) → injury.
//!
//! Both stub kits come out of the same startup name cache as the miss whooshes (`0x4575b0`), and
//! both emit at the victim two yards up. One reading is *not* taken literally: see the wound
//! vocal's own note on `HITINFO_AFFECTS_VICTIM` and what vmangos does with it on a parry.
//!
//! ## The material law, and where the ten slots actually come from (1567)
//!
//! Three of this module's INTERIM readings were one table: **`Material.dbc`'s `Flags` column**.
//!
//! - **metal vs wood** is `Flags & 1` (`0x457e80` → `0x5d9a50`), not `material != WOOD`. Leather,
//!   cloth and liquid are non-metal too — and so is the id 0 a creature with no virtual-item
//!   info carries, which the old test called metal.
//! - **the victim's slot** is `[vt+0x90]`, two implementations naming disjoint halves of the ten:
//!   a creature's `CreatureSoundData` column remapped `{0, 8, 7, 9}` (flesh/stone/wood/ethereal),
//!   or a **player's chest armor** (`0x62fb70`: plate → plate, chain → chain, else flesh). The
//!   chain and plate columns are reachable only through a player victim, and only the local one —
//!   the same self-only reach as the foley. benilla sent every player to flesh, which is why a
//!   plate warrior's own hits sounded like a punch on meat.
//! - **the clang's slot family follows the defending item's class**, not the victimState
//!   (`0x457de6`/`0x457dfd`): class 2 the parry pair, class 4 the shield pair, material picking
//!   metal or wood inside it. The item is `0x625400(sel)` — a parry prefers a mainhand weapon and
//!   falls through to the offhand, a block goes straight to the offhand — and **no defending item
//!   means no clang**, so an unarmed parry is silent. benilla read the mainhand for both and
//!   hardcoded the metal shield.
//!
//! One more byte detail: the clang alone is emitted two yards up (`0x457e29`); the generic weapon
//! impact beside it passes its position straight through.
//!
//! INTERIM readings (flagged for a wow-re pass): a defended outcome suppresses block 1's generic weapon impact
//! (the tail's latch test `0x624936` carries no victimState gate in the trace, so whether it
//! also plays under a clang is unpinned);
//! the natural-weapon column is gated on
//! contact like the weapon impact (whether the digit block also plays on a whiff is unpinned).
//! `$CPP`/`$CST` are pinned NON-audio (decision 0279): `$CPP` is the victim defense-anim
//! dispatch, `$CST` re-pings the attached combat-kit list — neither belongs to this module.
