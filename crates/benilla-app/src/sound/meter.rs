//! The **output meter** — what the mix's level actually *is*, in numbers (decision 1551).
//!
//! The three crackle hunts before this one (1026, 1109, 1112/1114) each ended by adding the meter
//! that would have named the mechanism: the callback-deadline load, the stream-decoder liveness,
//! the HAL's own IO cycle, the recorded waveform. Every one of them watches *timing*. None of
//! them watches **amplitude** — and amplitude is the one thing that goes wrong when a lot of
//! sounds happen at once, which is exactly the condition the director reports ("a lot of mobs
//! attacking same time... it gets really dirty, like a speaker breaking").
//!
//! It cannot be read off any existing counter, because a clipped mix is *healthy* by all of them:
//! the callback met its deadline, no decoder starved, the OS delivered every cycle on time. The
//! mix was computed perfectly — it was just louder than full scale, and kira's renderer answers
//! that with a hard `clamp(-1.0, 1.0)` (`backend/renderer.rs`), which is a squared-off waveform,
//! i.e. broadband distortion. So this meter sits on the main track **ahead of the limiter** and
//! records what the game *asked* for:
//!
//! - **`peak`** — the largest `|sample|` the summed mix reached. `> 1.0` means the request did not
//!   fit; `4.7` means the game asked for 4.7× full scale and (before 1551) got a clipped 1.0.
//! - **`over`** — how many samples were past full scale. One is a tick; a hundred thousand is the
//!   report the director filed.
//! - **`reduction`** — the deepest gain the limiter had to pull to make it fit ([`super::limiter`]
//!   writes it here), so the log line reads as one story: asked for this, allowed that.
//! - **`nonfinite`** — samples that were NaN or infinite. This is the meter's own blind spot,
//!   closed deliberately (decision 1556): `f32::max` *discards* a NaN operand and `NaN > 1.0` is
//!   `false`, so a mix carrying NaN reads as flawless on `peak` and `over` alike — and sails
//!   through the limiter's `peak > CEILING` test untouched, straight into the driver. A single
//!   non-finite sample is broadband noise at whatever the hardware makes of the bit pattern,
//!   which is *also* "a speaker breaking", and no counter we had could see it. It must be tested
//!   for explicitly or not at all.
//!
//! The audio-thread half is three atomics and a compare per sample. The main-thread half drains
//! them once per report window in `sound::poll_mix_health`.
