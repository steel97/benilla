//! The output stream — benilla's own kira backend (decision 1857).
//!
//! kira renders the mix; this module owns everything between that render and the speaker:
//! the device, the IO callback, the thread the mix runs on, and every meter that says whether
//! the sound reached the hardware on time.
//!
//! ## The shape: mix ahead, copy on the deadline
//!
//! The HAL calls our IOProc on its realtime IO thread once per device cycle, with a hard
//! budget: the buffer must be filled before the DMA reaches it. The 2026-09-02 overload the OS
//! itself annotated (`HALS_OverloadMessage: … HAL client proc exceeding io cycle budget` /
//! `safety violation`) was that budget blown while the mix's own compute was ~1% of it — the
//! callback did not *run* long, it *waited* long, on a machine with its swap 94% full and a
//! load average of 26. A page-in, a stall, anything that parks the thread for tens of
//! milliseconds inside the callback is a skipped cycle, and a skipped cycle is a crackle.
//!
//! So the IOProc no longer renders. A render thread of ours runs kira's [`Renderer`] ahead of
//! the device into a lock-free ring, and the IOProc copies from the ring — a few hundred
//! floats, hot in cache, nothing else. A stall now has the ring's depth to hide in instead of
//! one cycle's budget: [`OutputSettings::mix_ahead_ms`] of it, the reference's own
//! `SoundBufferSize` (FMOD 3's mix-ahead buffer, registered at 50 or 100 ms by host). The
//! render thread is scheduled the way Apple documents for an audio worker — a time-constraint
//! (realtime) policy, joined to the device's IO workgroup (`coreaudio::set_realtime`,
//! `coreaudio::Joined`) — so under CPU contention it is served like the HAL's own thread.
//!
//! ## What the meters can now say
//!
//! Every number that names a crackle's layer is read here and reported by
//! [`OutputBackend::service`] on the main thread:
//!
//! - **lead** — at IOProc entry, the host time the buffer is due at the DAC minus now: the
//!   HAL's own deadline for this cycle. A late wake shrinks it; negative means already late.
//! - **io** — the IOProc's wall time entry→exit. The copy costs microseconds; anything larger
//!   is the thread being parked inside the callback (the mechanism above).
//! - **gap** — spacing of successive cycle timestamps; a doubled gap is a cycle the HAL skipped.
//! - **underruns** — cycles the ring could not fill: the render thread fell the whole ring
//!   behind. The audible failure this design leaves, counted rather than guessed.
//! - **render** — the render thread's per-chunk wall time, kira's `cpu_usage` equivalent.
//! - **overloads** — `kAudioDeviceProcessorOverload`, stamped with the host time it fired.
//!
//! ## What the device layer does that the old stack could not
//!
//! Default-output changes, device loss and rate changes each raise a notice; `service`
//! rebuilds the stream on the new default. kira's own cpal backend could do none of that on
//! macOS (its device poll is compiled out there, and cpal 0.17 wired a no-op error callback
//! for the default device) — unplug the headphones and the old stream paused forever.
//!
//! The callback and the render loop are allocation-free by construction and *checked*: in
//! debug builds `assert_no_alloc` aborts the process on an allocation inside either.
