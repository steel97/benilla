//! The non-macOS half of [`super`] — the same surface as `coreaudio.rs`, over cpal
//! (decision 1920: Linux and Windows had been silent since the 09-02 sync, bug B356).
//!
//! [`super`] owns everything that decides *how* the mix reaches the speaker: the mix-ahead
//! ring, the render thread, the meters, the rebuild-on-device-change loop. That is platform
//! code nowhere. What is platform code is only the last hop — find the default output device,
//! open a stream on it, and hand our IO callback one buffer per cycle — and off macOS that hop
//! is ALSA or PipeWire on Linux, WASAPI on Windows, and something else again on the BSDs. cpal
//! is the layer that already speaks all of them, so this file is cpal wearing the shape
//! `coreaudio.rs` wears: [`Device`], [`Stream`], [`Cycle`], [`Notices`], [`Listeners`],
//! [`set_realtime`], [`now_ns`].
//!
//! ## The three places cpal does not hand us what CoreAudio does
//!
//! - **Cycle timestamps.** CoreAudio stamps every IO cycle with the host time its first frame
//!   reaches the DAC; the *lead* meter is that minus now. cpal gives the same quantity split in
//!   two (`OutputStreamTimestamp`'s `callback` and `playback`), so the lead is their difference
//!   and [`Cycle::output_time_ns`] is `now + (playback − callback)` — the same number the meter
//!   is about, reconstructed on our own clock.
//! - **Device notices.** CoreAudio raises a property listener when the default output changes,
//!   when a device dies, when its rate changes. cpal has no notification API at all, so
//!   [`Listeners`] is a half-second poll of the default device's identity and rate (the same
//!   mechanism kira's own cpal backend uses off macOS) plus cpal's stream error callback, which
//!   *is* delivered on these hosts — unlike on macOS, where cpal 0.17 wires a no-op for the
//!   default device. `kAudioDeviceProcessorOverload` has no analogue: the overload meter reads
//!   zero here, and the audible failure is counted where it always was, as a ring underrun.
//! - **Realtime scheduling.** No workgroups; [`Workgroup`] is inert. [`set_realtime`] is
//!   `SCHED_FIFO` on unix and MMCSS "Pro Audio" on Windows — see its own docs for what each
//!   costs when the OS refuses.
//!
//! Everything else — including the fact that an unsupported target simply reports no device and
//! the client runs silent — falls out of cpal, whose Null host is what it compiles to there.
