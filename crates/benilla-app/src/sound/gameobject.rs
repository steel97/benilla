//! GameObject **display-slot** sounds — `GameObjectDisplayInfo.Sound[0..9]`, the ten kit columns a
//! door/chest/goober plays as its animation runs.
//!
//! **One function in the reference reads those columns, and one thing reaches it.** `0x5f4010` is
//! the binary's only reader of `Sound[slot]` (whole-image census of the store `0xc0dce4` and its
//! index `0xc0dcec`: six references, four gameplay readers, three of them the ModelName column),
//! and its only caller is the GameObject M2 **animation-event** dispatcher `0x5f3e20` — registered
//! per object at create (`0x5f7d1f` → vtable `+0x30`) on the **family-A** types only, which is
//! exactly benilla's [`crate::go_anim::GoAnim`] population. `$GO0..5` address slots 0..5
//! (Stand/Open/Loop/Close/Destroy/Opened), `$GC0..3` the four Custom slots 6..9. So a display slot
//! is audible only when the object's own model authors the matching event keyframe *and* the clip
//! carrying it is playing: **there is no state-transition sound path** (wow-re
//! `object-layer/scratch/go-display-sound-events.md`, §5-cross-checked; benilla decisions
//! 1090/1867).
//!
//! **The kit's `SoundEntries` flag `0x200` picks the lane** — `0x5f4051 call 0x458830`, whose only
//! other consumer image-wide is a spell-visual path (wow-re `sound/scratch/doodad-sound-emitters.md`
//! §11's flag table). Clear ⇒ a positioned **one-shot** (`0x458870`). Set ⇒ the **ambient emitter
//! pool** (`0x461d80`), the same 32-entry table placed doodads' `$DSL` registers into, with the
//! handle cached in `[handler+0x18]` — one per object, shared with that object's own `$DSL` arm.
//! The loop is dropped again by `0x5f40c0`, called from the state-machine dispatch `0x5f3cb0`
//! ([`crate::go_anim::GoStateDispatch`]) and by the object's teardown; nothing else stops it, and
//! there is no `$DSE` arm on this dispatcher at all.
//!
//! **What the corpus actually contains** (`benilla-extract goslotscan`, the instrument this module
//! is checked against): 213 display rows carry a kit; per slot, *filled → reached by an authored
//! tag* is Stand 24→18, Open 99→80, Loop 28→14, Close 42→38, Destroy 26→14, **Opened 0→0**,
//! Custom0 77→56, Custom1 10→3, Custom2 5→1, Custom3 1→0. Thirty-seven live pairs name a looping
//! kit — every campfire, brazier, torch, fountain, hologram and Stratholme portal — which is the
//! whole reason the loop lane is not optional. Slot 5 Opened is empty data in 1.12.1: no display
//! row fills it, so it costs nothing and can never be heard.
