//! The cinematic **narration** — the race intro's voice-over, and the handle that lets an ESC cut
//! it off mid-sentence.
//!
//! Every race fly-by names a `SoundEntries.dbc` id on its `CinematicCamera` row, and all eight are
//! the same thing: a single streamed `Sound\CinematicVoices\<Race>Narration.mp3` (kit type 31,
//! "DwarfFlyByNarration" and its siblings). The two non-intro rows — `PalantirOfAzora` and
//! `Scry_cam` — name id 0 and play nothing.
//!
//! **Why this lives in the sound module rather than in [`crate::cinematic`].** Starting a stream
//! and holding its handle is sound-internal (`pick_stream`, the mixer, the category amp are all
//! `pub(super)` here), and the handle is the whole point: a dropped kira handle keeps playing, so
//! a skipped cinematic whose narration was merely forgotten would keep narrating over the game for
//! another minute. The reference has exactly the same problem and the same answer — it keeps the
//! cinematic's sound in a dedicated global (`[0xb4e274]`) and *releases* it on **three** paths,
//! which are all of its references besides the write at `0x48ef3e`: `0x48efef` on the shot
//! advance — and therefore on the ordinary end, since every shipped sequence is a single shot —
//! `0x48f055` on the stop/ESC, and `0x490b8d` in the local-abort teardown. The first was missing
//! from this list; the behaviour was not (a shot change and an ended cinematic both stop the voice
//! below, which is the same three edges).
//!
//! So this module watches [`Cinematic`]'s published shot and follows it: a new shot starts its
//! narration, and the shot going away stops it. That keeps the coupling one-way — the cinematic
//! plugin never learns what a mixer is.
