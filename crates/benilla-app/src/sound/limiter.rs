//! The **output limiter** — the mix's last stage, and the one that stops a busy soundscape from
//! tearing (decision 1551).
//!
//! ## What it replaces
//!
//! Every WoW SFX ships mastered to full scale: `HolyProtection.wav` (the Fortitude buff, the
//! director's own example) peaks at **1.000**, `MetalShieldBlock1.wav` at 1.000,
//! `LightningBoltImpact.wav` at 0.992 — measured off the shipped `sound.MPQ`. benilla's owned
//! gain chain is `category · v · rolloff · near_field`, every factor `<= 1.0`, so a single close
//! kit at `SoundEntries.Volume 1.0` (2 175 of the 4 623 rows) *already sits on 0 dBFS*. There is
//! no headroom anywhere in the chain, and the mix is a plain sum.
//!
//! So two of them is +6 dB past full scale and five is +14, and kira answers that with
//! `frame.clamp(-1.0, 1.0)` (`backend/renderer.rs`) — a squared-off waveform, which is broadband
//! distortion, which is what a speaker breaking sounds like. A priest's Prayer of Fortitude
//! lands `HolyProtection` on five party members inside one frame: five sample-aligned copies of
//! one 0 dBFS file, summing to exactly 5.0. Nothing upstream prevents it — `SoundEntries` id 3116
//! carries `Flags 0x0000`, so the no-duplicate bit (0x20, which 2 776 of the 4 623 rows *do*
//! carry) does not apply to it.
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! A **look-ahead brickwall limiter**, stereo-linked, with a mathematically exact guarantee of no
//! overshoot — so nothing ever reaches the renderer's clamp and the clamp stops being audible.
//! Three stages, all fixed-size and allocation-free on the render path:
//!
//! 1. **Required gain.** Per frame, `required = min(1, CEILING / max(|L|, |R|))` — stereo-linked so
//!    a limited transient never shifts the stereo image.
//! 2. **Anticipation.** A sliding *minimum* of `required` over the next [`LOOKAHEAD_MS`], then a
//!    moving *average* of that minimum over the same span. The audio is delayed by one look-ahead
//!    so the gain is already down when the transient arrives. The two windows are what make the
//!    bound exact: every term of the average is a minimum over a window that still contains the
//!    sample being scaled, so the average is `<= required` at that sample — a smooth gain curve
//!    that provably never overshoots. (The naive one-pole attack does overshoot: it approaches
//!    its target asymptotically and lets the first millisecond of a +14 dB transient straight
//!    through, which is the part you actually hear.)
//! 3. **Release.** The gain returns to unity exponentially over [`RELEASE_MS`] instead of snapping
//!    back the instant the peak passes. A limiter whose gain recovers in two milliseconds is
//!    modulating the signal at audio rate, which is its own distortion — worse on bass than the
//!    clipping it replaces.
//!
//! ## Why this and not fidelity
//!
//! This is **below** the decision-0070 seam, not across it: WoW's owned parameter math upstream is
//! untouched, and the thing being replaced is not a reference behaviour but *kira's* hard clamp.
//!
//! **The reference has no headroom mechanism at all — on either side of its API boundary.** That
//! is now read, not assumed: wow-re's §6 proved no constant factor exists anywhere in `WoW.exe`
//! (a close-up 1.0 kit reaches `FSOUND_SetVolume(255)` with the SFX master also 255), and
//! decision 1563 opened `fmod.dll` itself and found the other half — a complete multiply census
//! over all three software mixers turns up per-channel volume, `1/255`, `1/256`, `2⁻³¹` and a
//! mix-rate-derived ramp constant, and **nothing that depends on how many voices are live**. The
//! FPU mixer sums into a float buffer and clamps once; the MMX mixers (what the reference
//! actually runs) accumulate with **saturating** `paddsw` and their output stage is a bare
//! `movq` copy. So the real client sums at full scale and clips, exactly as we did.
//!
//! Two things it does have are often mistaken for headroom and are neither: the 12-voice device
//! ceiling with the 13 per-bus caps (ported — 1555, 1557), which bounds the *count*; and the SFX
//! auto-duck (`0x457960`), which wow-re §10 corrected — it is a **sidechain for server-pushed
//! unit voice lines** (`SMSG_PLAY_OBJECT_SOUND`), armed only by that one packet's pool, with the
//! arming sound itself exempt. Footsteps, spell impacts, weapon hits, UI sounds, creature barks,
//! music and ambience never arm it. It is not a bus limiter and would not have saved the mass
//! buff.
//!
//! Modern engines put a limiter here for exactly this reason — FMOD Studio ships one on the
//! master bus by default, and Wwise's own guidance is a peak limiter on the master output.
//! `SoundOutputLimiter 0` turns it off to A/B against what the director reported.
