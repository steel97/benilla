//! The dismount sound — the ONE genuine mount-transition sound the client plays (decision 0441
//! fold-back; byte-verified wow-re `mount-composition.md` Q4): the dismount handler `0x607ce0`
//! unconditionally tail-plays a FIXED global SoundEntries kit, resolved once at startup by
//! name-match — `"SpiritWolf_DONOTRENAME"` (`0x623110` → `0x8627bc`) — positioned at the
//! dismounting unit. It is NOT CreatureSoundData: no mount/dismount column exists, and the
//! attach path `0x607a00` plays nothing at all — mount-UP is silent (any summon whoosh rides
//! the summoning spell's own visual kit, spell-node, untraced). Fires on the live
//! mounted→unmounted transition of any visible unit; first sight of an unmounted unit records
//! silently, and a remount (id→id′) is not a dismount.
