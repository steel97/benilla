//! **Measuring mode** — `$WOW_SOUND_PROBE`: record a session so a sound report becomes evidence.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The output limiter (decision 1551) was built, measured, and proven offline — five sample-aligned
//! copies of a 0 dBFS buff go from `5.00x` full scale and 28 524 clipped samples to `0.99x` and
//! none. It shipped on by default. The director then played a real session and reported **no
//! audible change**: the mix still "gets really dirty, like a speaker breaking".
//!
//! That gap is the whole reason for this module. Per the contract, what the director hears
//! outranks any mechanism we found: a verified fix that does not change what they hear means the
//! mechanism we verified is not the mechanism they are hearing. Being right about *a* cause is not
//! being right about *the* cause, and the honest next move is not another fix — it is an
//! instrument that can tell the candidates apart in a **real run**, on their machine, on the
//! encounter they are describing.
//!
//! The candidates are genuinely different failures that sound alike through a speaker:
//!
//! | mechanism | signature in a probe capture |
//! |---|---|
//! | over-scale sum (1551's claim) | `pre.wav` past ±1.0, `post.wav` clean, `gain` well under 1 |
//! | **limiter not actually engaging** | `pre.wav` past ±1.0 **and** `post.wav` past ±1.0 |
//! | buffer underrun / missed deadline | both WAVs clean at the mark; `load >= 1.0`, `overruns` climbing |
//! | starved stream decoder | both WAVs clean; a hard step to zero in `post.wav` at the mark |
//! | **non-finite samples** | `nan > 0` — invisible to every other counter (see [`super::meter`]) |
//! | voice-steal / refusal clicks | `refused` climbing, a discontinuity at the mark |
//! | the limiter's *own* pumping | `post.wav` clean but `gain` diving repeatedly — a fix that is itself the complaint |
//!
//! Note the last row. An instrument that can only confirm its author's fix is not an instrument;
//! this one is built so that "1551 made it worse" is a reading it can produce.
//!
//! ## What a run produces
//!
//! Three files in `benilla-config/sound-probe/`, all written off the game thread:
//!
//! - **`pre.wav`** — the summed mix *as the game asked for it*, tapped ahead of the limiter.
//! - **`post.wav`** — what was actually heard, tapped after it.
//! - **`timeline.jsonl`** — the game-side story on a shared clock: a row every
//!   [`TICK`] with level/health/voice counts, plus an event per kit start, per marker keypress,
//!   and per refusal.
//!
//! Two taps rather than one is the point: with only the post-limiter tap the 1551 hunt could not
//! have distinguished "the mix never clipped" from "the limiter failed", which is exactly the
//! question the director's report raises.
//!
//! ## The shared clock
//!
//! A capture is only useful if a game-thread event can be placed on the waveform. The game clock
//! and the device clock are different clocks and they drift, so every row carries `a` — the frame
//! index published by the pre-tap ([`super::mix_tap::install_at`]), i.e. the exact sample offset
//! in `pre.wav`. A marker is then a *sample position*, not an approximate timestamp.
//!
//! ## The marker
//!
//! **F9** stamps the timeline the instant the director hears something. This is the piece that
//! makes a ten-minute session tractable: instead of scanning the whole capture for anomalies and
//! guessing which one they meant, the analysis starts at the marks and reads outward. The key is
//! bound *only* while probing, so it cannot collide with a game binding by construction.
