//! The **placed-doodad ambient emitter pool** — the reference's registration table at `0xb06dd8`
//! and its per-frame pump `0x461990` (wow-re `sound/scratch/doodad-sound-emitters.md`, §7/§8/§17).
//!
//! B345's fix gave every world-placed doodad a clock and routed its `$DSL` key to audio, which is
//! what made a lamp hum at all. It played that hum the obvious way — one channel per doodad, tagged
//! to the doodad — and that is **not the shape the reference has**. The client does not voice
//! doodads; it voices **sound ids**, and a doodad is only a *position* it can put one at:
//!
//! - `$DSL` registers the doodad's position as one **record** inside the pool entry that holds its
//!   SoundEntries id (`0x461d80`, handle `((entry+1) << 16) | record` kept in
//!   `[CMapDoodadDef+0x168]`). Every doodad naming the same id shares one entry.
//! - Each entry runs **exactly one channel**, positioned at whichever of its records is **nearest
//!   the listener** (`0x461ca0`'s 256-wide argmin), repositioned as that changes and **never
//!   restarted** (`0x7a5b10`). One hum follows you down a row of thirty lamps.
//! - The pump walks the 32 entries and lets the first **four** hold a channel (`0x4619c0 cmp
//!   edi,4`). Arbitration is by **ascending entry index — claim order, not distance**: a fifth
//!   distinct ambience is faded out over 3.0 s and does *not* take over when you walk toward it.
//!
//! So the three limits are structural, not a budget bolted on: **32 distinct ids**, **256 emitters
//! per id**, **4 sounding at once**.
//!
//! **What we had instead**, measured rather than assumed (`benilla-extract soundeventscan`): a
//! channel per doodad, parked on its own model and restarted every time you crossed its
//! `DistanceCutoff`. The *count* was held down by two gates that were never about ambience —
//! **45 of the 60** resolvable `$DSL` kits carry the reference's own `NO_DUPLICATES` bit (0x20),
//! which benilla applied on every lane, so three-quarters of doodad ambience already played
//! exactly one channel; the other 15 got up to two from `SAME_KIT_MAX`. One channel, yes — but at
//! whichever doodad happened to fire first rather than the nearest, retriggering at every cutoff
//! crossing, and with **nothing whatever** bounding the number of *distinct* ambiences, so a
//! torch-and-campfire cluster could take a third of the 12-voice ceiling away from the sounds a
//! player is actually listening for. Applying 0x20 here was itself wrong: it is the **one-shot**
//! lane's suppressor (§15), and this lane is now exempt from it
//! ([`super::kit::PlayExtras::dedupe_exempt`]).
//!
//! **What the pool is not.** It is not a cache and not an optimisation — it is the mechanism that
//! decides *where* a doodad ambience comes from and *which* ones you hear. Sharing a channel is
//! what makes the emitter track the nearest lamp; the cap is what makes the fifth one silent.
//!
//! **Deliberate divergences**, both documented at their site: a failed kit is flagged in place
//! rather than by negating the entry's id, and a channel the frame pump culls past the kit's own
//! `DistanceCutoff` is stopped rather than left running at zero gain. Neither changes what is
//! audible; see the notes on [`Entry::failed`] and [`pump_doodad_emitters`].
