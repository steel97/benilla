//! Footsteps (decision 0070 slice 3): the `$FSD` anim tag resolved through the terrain-type
//! chain — `surface under the unit → TerrainType → × the unit's footstep class →
//! FootstepTerrainLookup → SoundEntries`.
//!
//! **The surface is [`benilla_world::surface`]'s to answer, not this module's** (decision 1161). It is the
//! client's two-leg down-ray: a building that owns the column supplies its own floor's material,
//! and only outdoors does the ADT ground-effect layer decide. Reading the ADT unconditionally is
//! what put a snow crunch under the Kharanos inn's floorboards. `None` there is the reference's
//! `−1` and means silent — never "ask the other leg".
//!
//! **Trigger: `$FSD` and nothing else** (decision 1080). A footfall is two disjoint channels in
//! the client's event dispatcher `0x5ffbd0` — `$FSD → 0x623390` is the *sound*, the per-foot side
//! tags (`$FL/$FR/$RL/$RR/$SL/$SR/$BL/$BR/$WL/$WR`) `→ 0x5fbf70` are the *visual* footfall (the
//! decal + spray, [`crate::footprints`]) and play nothing (wow-re `footprint-decals.md` §1, §5
//! byte-arbitrated). Reading both as steps rang **every gait at double rate** — HumanMale's Walk
//! keys `$FR0 · $FSD · $FL0 · $FSD`, a horse's gallop four of each per 0.8 s cycle — and made the
//! turn-in-place shuffle, whose *only* keys are `$SL0 $SR0` at `t = 0.000`, clatter where the
//! reference is silent ([`crate::creature_anim::is_footstep_sound`]).
//!
//! ## A footfall is two sounds
//!
//! `$FSD` fires the terrain step **and** an armor foley, and the reference orders them: the foley
//! is `0x623390`'s first act after the state gates (`0x6233d9 call [vt+0x8c]`), *ahead of* the
//! class gate and every terrain lookup below. So a creature whose footstep class is 0 still
//! rustles, and the two land on different buses — the foley uncapped on bus 0, the step on bus
//! 9's cap of 6. Both are voiced here, in that order, rather than in two systems, because they
//! share those three gates and the client shares them too.
//!
//! The foley's material has two sources, one per vtable slot:
//! - **a unit** (`0x623610`) — `CreatureModelData.FoleyMaterialID` off its display
//!   (`[[unit+0xb3c]+0x28]`), i.e. what the *model* is dressed in.
//! - **a player** (`0x62fa30`) — the **chest** item's `Material`, read through the equipment
//!   GUID array at `[player+0x1d38]` element 4. That array is populated only for the local
//!   player (its ctor writes a count of 113 when the object's guid matches
//!   `0x468550`'s and **0 otherwise**, `0x5dd454`), so in the reference *other* players are
//!   silent-bodied. benilla reproduces that for free: `PLAYER_FIELD_INV_SLOT_*` is a private
//!   field the server sends only to you, so the same read is naturally self-only.
//!
//! `Material.dbc` then names the kit, and only three of its eight rows carry one — chain, plate
//! and leather. **Cloth is silent**, which is data, not a gap: a robed mage rustles nothing.
//!
//! The unit's class comes from its voice row (`CreatureSoundData.FootstepID`) through the
//! generic display→sound chain incl. the model fallback (`benilla_formats::creature_sound` —
//! characters reach class 7 as *data*). **Class 0, or no row at all, = no footstep sounds**:
//! the client's `$FSD` handler bails on a zero class before any lookup (`0x6233ec`, wow-re
//! `benilla-pins.md` B11, byte-confirmed); the lookup's class-0 rows are the Ancient
//! Protector's stomps (kit 661), reached only by that model's own nonzero class.
//!
//! Ahead of the class, `0x623390` opens on the same three state gates the visual handler does,
//! read on the ROOT unit (the rider of a mounted composite): **hover** (`0x6233aa`, move flag
//! `0x4000_0000`), **stealth/CREEP** (`0x62339c`, `BYTES_1` byte 3 bit `0x2` — not death) and
//! **player ghost** (`0x6233d3`, `PLAYER_FLAGS & 0x10`) — a stealthed unit is silent-footed.
//!
//! Wading (feet below a water surface, down to the unit's own swim boundary `0.75·h`) picks the
//! lookup's **splash** slot instead of dry (falling back to dry when the class has no splash kit);
//! deeper the unit swims and footfalls go silent. The flat 2.0-yd stand-in that boundary used to be
//! is retired now 0464's `collisionHeight` plumb has landed (decision 0645) — a murloc's footfalls
//! now go quiet in water that only reaches a human's knees. Still open: this reads a *depth* even
//! for the local player rather than its real mode flag — the named follow-up in decision 0530.
