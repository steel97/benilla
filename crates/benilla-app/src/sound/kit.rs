//! The **kit player** — WoW's owned sound selection over the mixer seam (decision 0070).
//!
//! A play request names a `SoundEntries` kit (by id or name, mirroring the client's
//! `PlaySoundById`/`PlaySoundByName` surface `0x458850`/`0x458030`); this module does what the
//! client does between that call and the backend: the audibility gate, duplicate suppression,
//! the weighted variation pick with a depleting pool (`0x45bb70`/`0x45bd40`), per-shot
//! volume/pitch variation (`0x458c60`/`0x458da0`), and the per-frame channel pump (reap finished,
//! distance-cull, recompute `category · v · rolloff · near_field` and feed the channel volume —
//! the `0x7a4ad0`/`0x7a5000`/`0x7a5dc0` loop).
//!
//! Pinned by the 2026-07-03 wow-re dispatch (`benilla-pins.md`, decision 0079): variation gates
//! are separate DBC bits (0x400 pitch / 0x800 volume — raw-copied flag word, B2), the draw is
//! the mulhi scale [`math::variation_draw`] (B1), and **no Type→category table exists** (B3) —
//! the client's volume category is set by which play driver was invoked, so [`play_kit`] takes
//! the category from its caller (SFX for world/UI triggers, ambience/music for the scheduler
//! drivers). Remaining INTERIM: out-of-range looping channels stop (audible again = restart by
//! the trigger) rather than pause/resume-virtualize.

/// overlapping copies, when it was played ungated). A voice cap that manufactures that under
/// load is worse than no voice cap: it breaks hardest in exactly the crowded moment it was added
