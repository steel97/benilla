//! **Vocal UI error speech** — the lines your own character says out loud when the client refuses
//! something: *"I can't do that yet."*, *"Not enough mana."*, *"Out of range."* (decision 1815).
//!
//! One engine function owns this in the reference — `SndInterfacePlayVocalUISound` `0x458250`,
//! whose **sole caller** is the message dispatcher `CGGameUI::DisplayError 0x496720` — and one
//! builder fills the table it reads, `0x4580f0`, called once from the local player's world-entry
//! (`0x5dea50`: race from the descriptor's own byte, sex from `0x5ed5b0`). Both are transcribed
//! here; the byte-level decode of each, and the shipped-data facts behind it, are in decision 1815.
//!
//! ## The table (`0x4580f0` → `[0xb06240]`)
//!
//! `2 × 0x44` twelve-byte slots indexed `sex * 0x44 + line`, filled for the player's **race** from
//! `VocalUISounds.dbc` ([`benilla_formats::VocalUiSound`]). Each slot carries the ordinary kit, the
//! annoyed kit, and the annoyed kit's variation count — the reference reads that count at build
//! time through `0x45cda0(kit) + 0x94`, which is the runtime kit record's populated-`File[i]`
//! counter, i.e. [`benilla_formats::SoundKit::files`]`.len()`.
//!
//! **benilla resolves BOTH kits at build time; the reference resolves only the annoyed one there.**
//! Same answer, and deliberately so: the reference's play core looks the ordinary id up at play
//! time and treats an unresolvable one as "did not play" (`0x45cda0`'s `cmp ecx,count; jae → NULL`),
//! whereas [`kit::play_kit_ext`] reports an unknown kit as an **error** — which for a table where
//! 281 of 1 066 ids are `0`/`-1` would be a warning per refusal rather than the silence the
//! reference produces. Resolving once, up front, keeps the observable identical and the log clean.
//!
//! ## The cycle (`0x458250`)
//!
//! Transcribed in [`VocalSpeech::speak`], and it is stranger than "play the line":
//!
//! 1. A **different** line than last time resets the escalation state (`0x4582ad`).
//! 2. If escalation is armed, play the **annoyed** kit at variation `n` — an *explicit* index that
//!    walks `0, 1, 2, …` (the ordinary line uses `-1`, the weighted-random pool). Advance `n`; if
//!    the kit is exhausted or the play was refused, disarm and reset.
//! 3. **Then attempt the ordinary line anyway** — there is no early return at `0x458316`, the
//!    annoyed arm falls straight through into `0x458324`. What stops you hearing both is the
//!    **bus-1 cap of 1** ([`kit::Bus::ERROR_SPEECH`]): the annoyed line is already holding the
//!    single slot, so the second attempt is refused at the gate and reports back that it did not
//!    play. That refusal is why [`kit::play_kit_ext`] returns a bool at all.
//! 4. On an ordinary line that *did* play, count it; at **four** consecutive plays of the same
//!    line, arm the escalation and reset the counter (`0x458359 cmp eax,4`).
//!
//! **On 5875's data the escalation is inaudible, and that is a fact about the data, not a gap.**
//! Every one of `VocalUISounds.dbc`'s 1 066 annoyed ids is absent from `SoundEntries.dbc`, so the
//! variation count is always 0, step 2 always disarms on its first attempt, and step 3 always
//! plays the ordinary line — pinned by `benilla_formats`'
//! `the_annoyed_column_resolves_to_nothing_in_this_build`. The cycle is transcribed anyway
//! because it *is* the mechanism, on the same footing as the dormant `0x800` volume-variation gate
//! in [`super::kit`].
//!
//! ## Gates
//!
//! `MasterSoundEffects` **and** `EnableErrorSpeech`, both read before anything else happens
//! (`0x458264`/`0x45827f`) — so a player with error speech off does not silently advance the
//! escalation counter either. The second is a real 1.12 CVar (`CVar::Register` at `0x457877`,
//! default `"1"`) wired to the stock Sound panel's fourth checkbox; [`super::SoundConfig`] carries
//! it and `crate::cvars` registers it.
