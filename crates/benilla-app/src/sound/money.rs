//! The money coin sound — `LOOTWINDOWCOINSOUND` on every change to the self-player's coinage.
//!
//! The real 1.12 client has **no dedicated money kit**: every coinage change plays
//! `LOOTWINDOWCOINSOUND` (SoundEntries kit 895) from a `CMirrorHandler` callback registered on
//! `PLAYER_FIELD_COINAGE` (`0x5ddf30`, wow-re `system/sound/scratch/acquire-spend-sounds.md`) — the
//! same watcher that also fires the `PLAYER_MONEY` UI event. So one rule reproduces the coin for
//! **buy** (spend), **sell** (gain), and **loot money** — all three move `PLAYER_FIELD_COINAGE` on
//! the wire — plus any other purse change (quest reward, mail, trade), exactly as the client does.
//! (Looting an *item* is the only acquire that plays a per-item sound instead; that lives in
//! [`super::ui`].)
//!
//! benilla plays it 2D on the SFX bucket when the mirrored coinage moves. The **first** observation
//! after login/reconnect is a seed, not a change — it never plays for the initial populate (the one
//! INFERRED point in the wow-re note; suppressing it is the correct-feeling choice and avoids a coin
//! on every zone-in). The real client double-plays loot money (an optimistic play at the click plus
//! this watcher); benilla keeps the single watcher-driven play — one clean coin on the confirmed
//! change, imperceptibly latent on localhost.
