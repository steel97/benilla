//! **The message catalog's sound half** — the branch of `CGGameUI::DisplayError 0x496720` that
//! nobody had wired (decision 1815).
//!
//! Every displayed client message is a row of the registry at `0xb4b498`
//! ([`benilla_ui::messages`], decision 1770), and the dispatcher reads two of that row's fields
//! before it ever reaches the text: `+0x08`, a **sound cue name**, and `+0x0c`, a **type tag**.
//! The test is one comparison (`0x49673d cmp [row+0xc],0x44 / je 0x496784`) and it picks between
//! two entirely different sounds:
//!
//! - **tag `== 0x44`** — play `+0x08` as a `SoundEntries` **name** through `PlaySoundByName`
//!   (`0x458030`), unless the name is the literal `"NONE"`. 30 of the 465 rows name a cue:
//!   `QUESTADDED`, `igQuestFailed`, `LEVELUP`, `TaxiNodeDiscovered`, `FRIENDJOINGAME`, …
//! - **tag `!= 0x44`** — ignore `+0x08` entirely and speak the tag as an **error-speech line id**
//!   in the player's own race and gender voice ([`super::vocal`]). 56 rows do this.
//!
//! benilla's catalog has carried both fields since 1770 and read neither; the one place a message
//! is displayed (`crate::ui_action::show_messages`) queues the record here instead, and this drains
//! it. So a message's sound now comes from the same row its text and its surface do, and cannot
//! drift from them — which is the whole argument for the table existing.
//!
//! **Where in `0x496720` this happens matters and is easy to get backwards** — the sound branch
//! runs *first*, before the row's key guard and before any text is resolved. See
//! [`MessageSounds::push`].
//!
//! **The reference's own gate ordering is preserved across the two arms and it is not symmetric.**
//! The cue arm plays like any other UI kit and is silenced by `MasterSoundEffects` at the mixer,
//! the way every other kit here is; the speech arm tests `MasterSoundEffects` *and*
//! `EnableErrorSpeech` in its own body, before touching any state (`0x458264`/`0x45827f`) — see
//! [`super::vocal::speak_line`].
