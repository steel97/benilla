//! **The death thud** — the body-fall impact as a corpse lands, fired on the `$DTH` animation
//! event (`0x6236e0`). The *other* half of the same event: its camera shake is
//! [`crate::camera_shake`]'s (`0x625c30`), and the two are siblings, not one system — the shake
//! is authored per model in `CreatureModelData` and only 49 of the 430 shipped models carry one,
//! while the **sound is universal**: **329 of the 407 creature-model files the archives hold** key
//! a `$DTH` (`benilla-extract thudcensus`; 430 rows collapse to 410 distinct paths, 407 of which
//! ship), and only the *sample* scales with the body. **Players included** — every character model keys one,
//! and `[unit+0xb34]` is filled from `UNIT_FIELD_DISPLAYID` for a player exactly as for a creature
//! (wow-re `base-render-alpha.md` §3), so your own body lands audibly too.
//!
//! ```text
//! $DTH → sizeClass = CreatureDisplayInfo.SizeClass ?? CreatureModelData.SizeClass
//!        terrain   = the surface under the unit → TerrainType → TerrainType.SoundID
//!        DeathThudLookups[sizeClass][terrainSound] → SoundEntries (land | water)
//! ```
//!
//! The terrain leg is **exactly the footstep sound's** ([`super::footsteps`]) — the reference
//! keeps one cached terrain-type dword per unit (`CGUnit+0xc60`) and the `$DTH` handler reads that
//! same dword at `0x623749`, as the `$FSD` handler does at `0x62341d`. `None` (the client's `−1`)
//! is silence here too, never "ask the other leg".
//!
//! ## Indoors is silent, and that is the data
//!
//! The two consumers share the terrain id and then **diverge on it**, which is the single most
//! surprising thing about this system. Both tables are keyed on `TerrainType.SoundID`, and
//! `TerrainType 10 "None"` — the id a WMO surface takes when its `MOMT+0x20` says nothing — has
//! `SoundID = 0`. `FootstepTerrainLookup` carries a row at terrain sound **0** for 17 footstep
//! classes; `DeathThudLookups` carries **none at all**. So the same floor that creaks underfoot
//! swallows the body that lands on it.
//!
//! That is not a rounding error in the content: `benilla-extract thudcensus` measures **10 075 of
//! the 10 299 shipped MOMT materials (97.8 %) at `TerrainType 10`**, and **694 of the 815 WMO
//! roots have no surface that can thud at all** — every inn and tavern in the game among them.
//! What *does* thud indoors is the blacksmiths, barns, barracks, chapels, Stormwind, Ironforge and
//! most dungeon sets, whose floors carry a real Stone/Metallic/Wood material.
//!
//! So "a big corpse hit the ground silently *indoors*" is the **reference's own behaviour**, not a
//! gap — and the retest for this system has to be run outdoors, or in one of the 121 buildings the
//! census names.
//!
//! **Three gates, and no others.** The handler's early-returns in order (`0x6236e0`):
//!
//! 1. **In liquid, and more than `2.0` yd of it over the corpse's feet** (`0x62372a`, the float
//!    at `0x801628` — the same dword the armor foley lifts its emitter by) ⇒ **completely
//!    silent**. Not "play the land one": a body that sinks makes no sound at all.
//! 2. **Size class outside `0..=4`** (`0x623744`, an *unsigned* `>= 5`, so a `−1` from both DBC
//!    rows lands here) ⇒ silent. No shipped display reaches it.
//! 3. **No terrain, or no lookup row** ⇒ silent, and a resolved kit of `0` is silence too.
//!
//! And that is the whole list. Unlike the footstep it does **not** gate on hover, stealth,
//! player-ghost, a CVar or distance — the same "no gates at all" the sibling camera shake has.
//! Nor does it walk to a root unit: a `$DTH` is a corpse's own collapse, and nothing rides a
//! dying mount.
//!
//! **One deliberate deviation, on gate 1's *other* half.** The reference picks the water column
//! on "the unit's liquid node reports liquid" alone (`[node+0x90] & 0x20`, `0x670630`) — a flag
//! with no depth test of its own, so a body lying on a beach beside a lake would splash. benilla
//! asks the question the footstep splash already asks: is the surface **above the feet**
//! (`depth > 0`). Same answer wherever the reference is right, and the shore case is the one
//! place they differ. (`0x670630`'s own semantics are out at the RE; if the node flag turns out
//! to already mean "submerged", the two collapse into one.)
//!
//! The play is `0x458870` — **bus 0, uncapped** (`0x458880 xor ecx,ecx`; cap `0x7FFFFFFF`), 3D at
//! the unit's own position origin (its feet, `vtbl+0x14`), with no Z lift. That is the same call
//! the armor foley makes, and deliberately *not* the capped [`Bus::FOOTSTEP`] the step itself
//! takes: a battlefield's worth of bodies all land. The `1.0` it passes is a **multiplier** on the
//! kit's authored `SoundEntries.Volume`, not the final gain — the shipped rows carry 0.4 for
//! Small/Medium, 1.0 for Large/Giant/Colossal, 0.3/0.6 in water — and the `-1` beside it is a
//! **file-variation index** (`variant != -1`), not a channel. Every `DeathThud*` row sets flag
//! `0x400`, so the kit player's own ±15 % pitch draw applies (`0x458da0`, [`super::math`]).
