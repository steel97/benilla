//! Water audio (decision 0070 slice 4): the water splash. (The wading **footstep** splash
//! lives in [`super::footsteps`]; the submerged ambience swap lives in [`super::zone`] — the
//! client swaps the one background-ambience slot to the underwater loop, B6.)
//!
//! **The splash trigger is a symmetric depth edge** — VERIFIED (the swim §5's TU-D, wow-re
//! `swim-mechanism.md`, resolving benilla-pins B7/B8's trigger half): a dedicated detector inside
//! the per-frame water decision `0x6030c0` (`0x60314a`) compares `depth = surface − feet` against
//! **`0.4·collisionHeight`** and fires a positioned unit sound on crossing in **either direction**
//! — entering fires it, and so does surfacing back past the line (exit is NOT silent). It is
//! *distinct from* the swim boundary (`0.75·h`): the splash fires waist-deep, before the swim
//! mode starts. Walking the shallows below the line makes only per-step wading splashes
//! (director-verified against the ref, 2026-07-03).
//!
//! What stays INTERIM (same dispatch, still open): the **size class** — the client routes the
//! play through the unit's own sound emitter (`[CGUnit+0xb18]`) where Small/Medium/Large
//! resolves; that selector is not pinned, so kit 1096 Medium plays for everyone. The per-unit
//! **collision height** the line scales by is no longer interim: 0464's named
//! `CreatureModelData.collisionHeight` plumb landed in decision 0645, and this reads it off the
//! unit ([`crate::entities::CollisionHeight`]) instead of scaling the player capsule.
