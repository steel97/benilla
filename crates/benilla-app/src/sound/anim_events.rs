//! Route M2 animation event tags (`crate::creature_anim::AnimSoundEvent`) to audio — the
//! anim-driven trigger surface (decision 0070 slice 3).
//!
//! Routed here: `$SND`/`$DSO` (one-shot kit `data` at the model), `$DSL`/`$DSE` (an ambient loop
//! — **registered into, and released from, the emitter pool** [`super::emitter_pool`], which owns
//! everything about how it sounds; the two dispatchers' arms differ and both are modelled below),
//! `$CSD` — the **character emote clips' embedded voice** (HumanMale EmoteLaugh 70 carries
//! `$CSD 6923` = the SoundEntries kit literally named `HumanMaleEmoteLaugh`; Cry 77 → 6921,
//! Chicken 78 → 6919, Applaud 80 → 4× `ClapSounds` 6576 — probe-verified on the real 5875 M2 +
//! SoundEntries; the client's `$CSD` handler `0x623c10` → `0x459230` plays the event payload as
//! a literal SoundEntries id, byte-confirming the routing — wow-re
//! `sound/scratch/gather-sound-anim-events.md`) — and the **gathering/work pair** (decision
//! 0562, same wow-re note):
//!
//! - **`$TRD`** (`0x62faa0`): the in-flight spell's `SpellVisual` **field-14 strike sound**,
//!   positioned — **the mining pick clang** (visual 93 → 1143 "Mining Impact") and the crafting
//!   hammer (the smithing visuals carry the same field), fired at the work anims' 0.666 s
//!   impact keyframe. Fully client-side: the in-flight spell is the unit's cast hold (the
//!   client caches it from the local GO interaction, `0x6ec220` → `[CGUnit+0xc8c]`), so no
//!   server state is involved.
//! - **`$ESD`** (`0x6239f0`): the unit's `UNIT_NPC_EMOTESTATE` → `Emotes.dbc` `EventSoundID`,
//!   gated on `EmoteSpecProc == 2`, positioned at the unit — wire-driven work-state sounds
//!   (a chopwood camp worker's state 234 → 3202; state 233 carries a second mining kit 3782,
//!   which no vmangos path ever sets for a player — verified at its source).
//!
//! `$CST`/`$CSL`/`$CSR` are still NOT routed, but **the reason we gave was wrong** and is
//! corrected here (wow-re `anim-event-position-law.md` §5). The handler `0x60c940` does only
//! 3D-**reposition** the already-playing cast handle — that part held — but it repositions it to
//! the **event's own point** (`0x600143 mov edx,[ebx+0x10]` → `0x60c960`/`0x60c990` → `0x61ceb0`),
//! i.e. to the casting hand, not to the caster. benilla's kit player tracks a looping cast sound
//! to the caster's origin, so the role is *not* covered: we are a body-width out for the whole
//! cast. Left unbuilt rather than half-built, because what the reference does when the
//! GUID-tracked follow and this reposition disagree is not settled here — decision 1915's open.
//!
//! `$FD1..$FD9`/`$FDX` have no sound route at all yet (they are the CreatureSoundData fidget
//! family). When one lands it wants the **unit origin + 2.0 z** (`0x6232c0` → `0x6230a0`), not
//! the fired key's point — the same shape `$TRD` takes below.
//!
//! The footstep family and the CreatureSoundData-driven tags (`$FD*` fidgets, `$AH*` attacks,
//! `$CSS` swings) are routed by their own consumers as those land (slice-3 tasks); unrecognized
//! tags are trace-logged so the stream is observable without spam.
