///   Both take the class-bark route (`0x5fff9c` pushes class 7, `0x5fff78` class 10, into
///   `[vtable+0x88]`), so they *are* rolled — against thresholds of **100**, which the inclusive

///   uncapped bus. Playing them unconditionally is faithful; it is worth knowing that it is
///   faithful for a reason living in a table rather than in the control flow.
/// - **`$FDX` → the stand vocal, gated three times over**, which is what this function had wrong:
///   the local-player skip (`0x6236c2` — you never hear your own), then a **40.6 %** chance roll
///   ([`STAND_CHANCE`]), then a **10 s cooldown on one world-global timestamp**

///   `$FDX` at t=0.000 of a 4.000 s **loop-flag** Stand variation carrying 45 % of the variation
///   weight, and a t=0 key re-fires on every wrap. Row 136's stand column is kit 571
