//! Glue-screen audio (decision 0423's polish pass) — the two sounds of the pre-world screens:
//!
//! - **Clicks**: the char select/create screens emit [`GlueSound`] messages naming the SoundEntries
//!   kits the 1.12 GlueXML plays verbatim (`gsCharacterCreationClass`, `gsCharacterSelectionEnterWorld`,
//!   …); [`play_glue_sounds`] drains them into the kit player as 2D SFX — the same shape as
//!   [`super::ui`]'s `PlaySound` seam, but from the glue screens (which have no Lua VM).
//! - **Music**: the glue title theme (`GlueParent.lua`'s `CurrentGlueMusic`,
//!   `Sound\Music\GlueScreenMusic\wow_main_theme.mp3`), streamed from the login screen on
//!   (decision 0539) and kept across the glue screens (the ref keeps it through select ⇄ create).
//!   **The click into the world does not end it** (1550/1553, wow-re §5): it plays unbroken through
//!   the whole map load, and the stop is armed by the *load draining* — a 3.0 s fade, still behind
//!   the loading screen. Re-entering the glue after a logout starts it again.
