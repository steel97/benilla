//! **The ranged weapon prop's own animation** (decision 2281) — the bow's limbs bend, the gun
//! fires its muzzle blast.
//!
//! An equipped ranged weapon is not just a mesh in a hand. The reference keeps its M2 *instance*
//! at `[CGUnit+0xd24]` (written by the ranged-attach helper `0x611e10` @`0x611eca`, populated on
//! any sheath→2) and re-arms **that model's own animation** from two keyframes on the body clip:
//!
//! - **`$BWP`** (BowPull, keyed only in LoadBow 105 @0.434 s / LoadRifle 106 @0.433 s) →
//!   `0x624cc0`: if the prop's model *owns* animation **160 BowPull** (`0x624cee push 0xa0; call
//!   0x711960` — a presence test it bails on), play it on the prop at a rate that fits its
//!   authored length into the body clip's REMAINING time (`0x624e31`'s computed float arg).
//! - **`$BWR`** (BowRelease, keyed only in AttackBow 46 @0.033 s / AttackRifle 49 @0.000 s) →
//!   `0x600159`, which **forks on the weapon family** and arms a different clip for each:
//!   - the body is playing a **bow** clip (`0x5fcfb0`: 46 AttackBow / 105 LoadBow / 109 HoldBow) →
//!     the prop plays **animation 0 (Stand)** (`0x600209`) — the drawn limbs relax;
//!   - the body is playing a **rifle** clip (`0x5fcfd0`: 49 AttackRifle / 106 LoadRifle / 110
//!     HoldRifle — guns AND crossbows) → the prop plays **animation 161 (BowRelease)**
//!     (`0x600273`, `push 0xa1`).
//!
//! **That second arm is the gun's muzzle blast, and it is why this file exists.** A firearm M2
//! authors exactly two sequences — Stand(0) and BowRelease(161) — and hangs its whole flash on the
//! second: `Firearm_2H_Rifle_A_01.m2` carries **seven** particle emitters, each holding a flat rate
//! in every sequence (100/s, 50/s, 40/s, 30/s, 20/s) and keying only its **enabled gate** — shut
//! across Stand, open from the head of 161 for a window of its own (34 ms, 134 ms, 4 × 200 ms,
//! 334 ms: a spark, a flare, the body of the flash, a smoke tail). Bone 2, the parent of all seven
//! emitter bones, is keyed a constant **+90° about Y** in 161 against 0° in Stand — which is what
//! aims the blast down the barrel instead of straight up out of the receiver. 21 of the 22 firearms
//! in the 5875 chain author 161; 25 bows and crossbows author 160 *and* 161; nothing else in the
//! 571-model weapon corpus authors either. Without this arm the emitters build, pool and tick for
//! ever on a sequence whose gate is shut, and a gun shot is silent art.
//!
//! **It is the GATE that is keyed, never the rate** — the track at `def+0x1dc`, outside the ten
//! scalar ones, `u8`-valued, step-interpolated (decision 2286). A consumer that asks "does this
//! emitter emit anything?" of the *rate* sees a non-zero constant in every sequence, for a bank
//! that has never once been switched on; that false negative is why this shipped broken and why a
//! wow-re round briefly published the opposite reading.
//!
//! **wow-re recorded the opposite**, flagged INFERRED: `ranged-shot-anim.md` read the mechanism as
//! "bow-only by asset … gun/crossbow/thrown/wand have **no** analogous prop re-anim call anywhere
//! (exhaustive search)". The rifle arm is in the same function as the bow arm, eleven instructions
//! apart. The §5 correction round landed as wow-re `ranged-prop-reanim-two-arm.md`: the fork is
//! CONFIRMED in every detail, and its census finds **exactly four** sites that arm `[+0xd24]` —
//! `0x624e31` (160), `0x600209` (0), `0x600273` (161) and `0x60f59d` (0, the reset below). The
//! surviving, precise form of "no analog" is **thrown and wand**: a third family predicate
//! `0x5fcf90` = {107, 111, 112} exists and the `$BWR` handler never calls it, so those two match
//! neither arm and get no prop animation at all.
//!
//! **Both arms sit under a gate, and it is the projectile queue** (decision 2288). `[CGUnit+0xac]`
//! is not a spell-visual list, as this file first guessed from its readers — it is the queue of
//! `CMissile` nodes waiting for the caster's release event, and `$BWR` reads it (`0x600182`) before
//! draining it (`0x600294` → `0x60c940`, the launcher). So the prop's re-anim and the projectile's
//! launch are two effects of one act: no missile queued, no flex. benilla already held that queue —
//! [`crate::entities::PendingMissiles`], whose own doc named `+0xac` correctly long before this
//! round — and the chain runs this arm ahead of the drain, which is the order the two addresses
//! sit in.
//!
//! What this file does NOT own: the prop's rig and palette rows (the rider lane —
//! [`benilla_world::rig_rider`], given a posed arm by 2281), the emitters' clock (`EmitClock::Host`
//! on the prop root, wired at the attach), or the bowstring chord ([`crate::bowstring`], which now
//! spans the *posed* limb tips because of this).
