//! The minimap **blip layer** (decision 0203 phase 3; the byte law per the wow-re fold-back,
//! decision 0337): AreaPOI landmarks + quest dots + the hover tooltip.
//!
//! **Landmarks** — byte-verified end to end (`wow-5875-re` `system/ui/scratch/
//! minimap-poi-questdot.md`, §5 four-pair cross-check; selection `0x6d9a90`, candidates
//! `0x6d8e10`, draw `0x4ed148`/`0x4ee170`):
//! - **Candidates**: `ContinentID == current map` AND `Flags & 1` — nothing else (no faction,
//!   no importance gate; both factions' rows are candidates).
//! - **In-range** (`d/viewRadius ≤ 0.8`): draws the `POIIcons.blp` cell indexed by the DBC
//!   `Icon` column at the POI's true position — but **only** rows with `Flags & 2` (in 5875
//!   data that is exactly the 32 world-PvP tower rows, e.g. the EPL towers). An ordinary
//!   in-range landmark (town/city, `Flags & 2` clear) draws nothing.
//! - **Out-of-range**, `d ≤ 694.444`: the nearest **3**, ranked by (`Importance` **signed**
//!   asc, dist asc) — the rank key is Importance, NOT AreaID (the fold-back's C2 correction) —
//!   drawn ON the 0.8 rim, each **rotated to point at its POI** (the client bakes direction +
//!   `0.8·radius` into the arrow frame's matrix), in the art its **source** calls for: see
//!   [`RimArrow`], the four-way table 1519 pinned.
//!
//! **Quest dots** — the ObjectIcons classifier `0x4eaa90`: reads the SAME per-guid
//! DIALOG_STATUS cache the overhead `!`/`?` markers mirror (one `SMSG_QUESTGIVER_STATUS`, two
//! consumers), and draws a dot **only for status == 7** (REWARD2) → the gold **cell 3**.
//! Status 6 draws NO dot (the vmangos "6 = red dot" comment is server intent, not this
//! client; blue cell 4 is party members, green cell 2 is never populated in 1.12.1). Dots
//! hard-cull at the live zoom radius in **3-D** world distance (no rim ride), and draw
//! LAST — above every arrow.
//!
//! **Tracking dots** (decisions 0560/0564) — the classifier's fall-through for objects NOT
//! at quest status 7, **byte-carved end to end** (wow-re `minimap-poi-questdot.md` §B2 +
//! `track-predicates.md`, the §5 trio): a GameObject passing `0x5ed2b0` draws the gold
//! **cell 0** (Find Herbs/Minerals), a unit passing `0x5ed210` the red **cell 1**. The
//! masks are the `PLAYER_TRACK_CREATURES`/`PLAYER_TRACK_RESOURCES` descriptor mirror
//! (fields 1104/1105 — `values[UNIT_END] + 0x394/0x395`, byte-exact) with one bit per
//! active tracking aura's MiscValue. A GO tests its lockId → `Lock.dbc` skill-slot
//! `LockType`; a unit its creature type via the 3-way resolver `0x605570` (shapeshift-form
//! override → cached creature template → race/Humanoid), behind two always-show clauses:
//! `UNIT_DYNFLAG_TRACK_UNIT` (Hunter's Mark) and our track-stealthed bit vs the target's
//! CREEP vis-flag (the TRACK_STEALTHED consumer). No alive/dead or faction gate.
//!
//! **Sizes are byte-pinned** (wow-re §SIZE, the 0342 fold-back): every blip constant is
//! frozen once by the CGMinimapFrame ctor against the stock widget's 140.8-px screen basis —
//! dot 8 px, POI icon 16 px, orbit 0.8 × the 70.4-px half-disc; the arrows render their M2
//! models at 768 px/unit (rim, modelScale 0.6) and 1280 px/unit (player). Both arrow models
//! are plain textured quads (measured from the real M2s), so the flat-sprite stand-in is
//! geometry-exact at the model's own quad size — no uv crop, the padding is authored. The rim
//! model stacks six of them, but only ever shows one at a time ([`RimArrow`]).
//!
//! **The guard's directions marker** ([`crate::poi_marker`], decisions 1514/1516) is a landmark
//! candidate like any other, appended after the DBC filter the way the reference appends its
//! static blip slot — everything above applies to it unchanged, except the one thing that is
//! *about* being a different kind of thing: its rim arrow is the gold guide arrow ([`RimArrow`]).
//!
//! Remaining residue: one gate the landmark selection here does NOT implement, found by the 1516
//! §5 and belonging to the DBC rows rather than the marker — a `WorldStateID` gate at `0x6d9b27`.
//!
//! Three more from the 1525 §5, all recorded rather than built (each is a visible change to a
//! feature that is not the arrow art, and one is contested):
//! - **The corpse is in the wrong array and the pet blip is missing** — see [`emit_party_arrows`].
//! - **Rim arrows have a per-source z-order we flatten.** `+0x48` doubles as a frame-level offset
//!   (`[minimap+0xc4]+3+kind`, POI frames re-levelled every draw at `0x4ed344`; party frames once
//!   at creation), giving bottom→top: landmark, party/pet, quest, gossip, corpse. We paint every
//!   arrow at one `z_key` in emission order, which happens to agree on landmark-under-party and
//!   disagrees above that. **NOT built because wow-re's two findings conflict**: `0x4ed7b7` has the
//!   object dots drawing LAST, above every arrow, while this table puts gossip and corpse above the
//!   quest dot. Frame level vs. the parent's own draw order is a compositing question neither note
//!   settles, and guessing would move a look on a coin flip. Needs its own scoped pin.
//! - **Static blip slot 0 is `SelectQuestLogEntry()`'s marker** (`0x4def70`, cleared by
//!   `0x4df0e0`): selecting a quest in the log drops a gold guide arrow at that quest's POI —
//!   `flags = 0`, so it is **arrow-only**, showing nothing once you are inside the 0.8 rim. Live
//!   code, not a dead hook, and a feature we do not have. (Its `PointX/PointY` source is INFERRED
//!   from use, not byte-derived.)
//!
//! Also: dots re-project every frame where the reference draws ~1 Hz-stale
//! snapshot coords verbatim (a throttle quirk, deliberately not aped — positions agree for
//! standing NPCs); the subzone grey tint (`0xffb0b0b0`) on dots and their tooltip is drawn
//! from the indoor-containment MISMATCH — the exact `0x670540` compare is INTERIM pending its
//! scoped pin; the tooltip anchor beside the map is an eyeball (the engine handler `0x4eb0c0`
//! law gives content, not the exact seat).
