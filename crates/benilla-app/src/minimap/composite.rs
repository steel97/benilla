//! The WMO-interior minimap's **offscreen composite** — the client's own compositing pipeline
//! (decision 1466, from wow-re `system/minimap/scratch/wmo-interior-minimap-composite.md`).
//!
//! Indoors the reference does not draw the group tiles onto the screen. It draws them into a fixed
//! **256 × 256** render target created once at `0x4eda42`/`0x4eda48`, under an ortho half-extent of
//! **1.5 × the view radius** (`0x4ec130`, the `× 1.5` at `0x80308c`), cleared **colour-only** to
//! opaque black (the packed `0xAARRGGBB` unpacked at `0x59b910`), with **blending disabled** and an
//! **alpha test** at `GEQUAL 224/255` — then blits the **middle two-thirds** of that target, which
//! is what nets the `1.0 × radius` on screen.
//!
//! **Both halves of that are load-bearing, and they only work together.** The alpha test is what
//! stops two group tiles that meet along a shared wall from leaving the clear colour between them
//! (blended, each contributes a filtered partial edge and up to 25% of the black shows through —
//! B141's "odd black lines", at *every* joint). But the target's resolution is what stops the
//! **genuine** gaps in the bake from reading: `3 · radius / 256` model-yd per texel is 0.703 yd at
//! the default indoor zoom against the tiles' authored 0.5 — a ~1.4× **minification before the
//! test**, in which a one-texel bake gap is simply never sampled. Drawing the tiles alpha-tested
//! straight to the screen, where we rasterise ~1.85× *finer* than the client ever did, turns those
//! same gaps from a soft grey line into a hard black one — measured, and the reason this module
//! exists rather than just the render state (1466's "why part 1 alone makes it worse").
//!
//! Mechanically: [`super::emit_minimap`]'s interior branch fills [`MinimapComposite`] with this
//! frame's tiles in **target space** instead of pushing them at the screen; [`drive_composite`]
//! materialises them as pooled quads on the composite camera's own render layer; and the interior
//! branch draws ONE screen quad sampling the target, masked to the minimap circle as usual.
//!
//! The tiles ride a **shared unit-quad mesh and a per-texture material**, moving on their
//! `Transform` alone (1463's law): the composite re-aims every frame the player walks, and
//! rebuilding ~50 meshes a frame to express a pan is exactly the churn that pass avoids.
