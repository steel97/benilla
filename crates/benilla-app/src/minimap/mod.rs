//! The HUD minimap renderer (decision 0203 phase 1) — the app half of the `<Minimap>` widget.
//!
//! The engine side (benilla-ui) carries the widget's rect + zoom and emits a
//! `QuadContent::Minimap` hole at the frame's own draw slot; `ui_script::extract::drive_script` parks that
//! in [`MinimapWidget`], and [`emit_minimap`] (in the [`UiQuadAppend`] window) fills it: the
//! streamed tile window around the player, clipped to the widget rect and masked to the
//! `MinimapMask.blp` circle at present time, with the player arrow rotating on top. Children of
//! the widget (border art, buttons, zone text — `MinimapCluster.xml`) draw above per the normal
//! z order.
//!
//! Mechanism per wow-re's T3 minimap node (byte-verified there, transcribed here):
//! - **Tile grid**: one 256² minimap BLP per ADT tile (533.33 yd), named `map<X>_<Y>.blp` in the
//!   map's directory and resolved through `md5translate.trs` to a hashed file under
//!   `textures\Minimap\` ([`benilla_formats::MinimapTranslate`]). Index order = the ADT order
//!   (chain-verified, see the formats re-export note).
//! - **Zoom → world radius** (`zoom_to_scale` 0x6da9b0): the client keeps **two** zoom indices,
//!   selected by whether the player is inside a WMO. **Outdoors** the chunk-count table
//!   `{14,12,10,8,6,4} · 0.5 · 33.333` yd of half-extent; **indoors** the radius table
//!   `{150,120,90,60,40,25}` yd outright ([`INTERIOR_ZOOM_RADIUS`]). Each index persists separately
//!   (CVars `minimapZoom` / `minimapInsideZoom`).
//! - **North-up orientation**: screen up = world +X (north), screen left = world +Y (west).
//!
//! Tiles stream through the `mpq://` async asset source (the terrain streamer's hitch-free bulk
//! path); handles cache per tile in [`MinimapTileCache`] and reset on a map change.
//!
//! Submodules: [`interior`] — the WMO-interior group selection (portal flood-fill) + tile-name
//! stem; [`blips`] — the phase-3 blip layer (AreaPOI landmark arrows, quest-giver dots, the
//! hover tooltip).
