//! The minimap **ping** (decision 1596; the feature 0471 paused and this brings back).
//!
//! ## The pin
//!
//! A ping marks a **place in the world**, so a world point `(x, y)` is the only thing this module
//! stores. Where it lands on screen is *derived* — by the stock `Minimap_OnUpdate`, which
//! re-seats the `MiniMapPing` frame every frame from `GetPingPosition()`, the normalized offset
//! [`drive_minimap_ping`] republishes from the pin against the live view radius. It therefore
//! cannot drift from the map, cannot lag the pan by a frame, and cannot survive a zoom change at
//! the old scale: there is no second copy of the position to fall out of step with.
//!
//! That is the whole difference from the first attempt (decision 0453 / 0471), which stored the
//! world point in the engine but drew the marker from **Lua** off a stale push; 1596 §2 has the
//! autopsy.
//!
//! ## The three legs
//!
//! - **In** — a click reaches Lua's `Minimap_OnClick` (the stock one, hookable: the corpus's
//!   `CleanMinimap` replaces that global outright), which calls `Minimap:PingLocation(dx, dy)`
//!   with centre-relative offsets in **UI units**. [`seat_click`]'s caller drains it in the *same
//!   frame it draws the map*, converting through that frame's own geometry: UI units × the 0582
//!   seam scale = window px, ÷ `px_per_yd` = yards. (Skipping that seam multiply is what put the
//!   first version's ping ~27 % too far from the player at 1080p.)
//! - **Across** — our own ping sends `MSG_MINIMAP_PING` (raw world floats; the server relays them
//!   verbatim to the rest of the group and nowhere else). A group member's arrives through the
//!   session event and seats the same way. A ping is seated **locally at click time**, never
//!   waited for off the wire: vanilla pings work solo.
//! - **Out** — `MINIMAP_PING (unitToken, nx, ny)` fires for addons, with the same normalized
//!   offsets the byte-verified relay `0x4ee330` hands Lua (`(−dy·k, dx·k)`, `k = 1/(2·radius)` —
//!   wow-re `party-group-wire.md` §TU-D). `Minimap:GetPingPosition()` reads the live value back.
//!
//! ## Lifetime and pixels — the stock `Minimap.lua`'s and its `<Model>`'s, not ours
//!
//! The reference splits the ping in two: the engine stores the world point in a pair of statics
//! **nothing ever clears** (wow-re `minimap-ping-law.md` §3 — six instructions touch those cells
//! and the only zeroing is a CRT initializer), and FrameXML owns everything visible — the
//! `MiniMapPing` `<Model>` it shows on `MINIMAP_PING`, re-seats every frame from
//! `GetPingPosition()`, holds 5 s (`MINIMAPPING_TIMER`), "fades" 0.5 s through a `SetAlpha(255·t)`
//! that clamps to full until the last ~2 ms, and hides. Since 1751's swap that file runs here
//! verbatim (1974), and since decision 2013 the `<Model>` it shows **renders its own file**
//! (`Interface\MiniMap\Ping\MinimapPing.mdx`, through `crate::ui_models`): the spinner on its
//! global-sequence clock, the static centre, the ring on the looping Stand — the model's own
//! bones, weight tracks and additive quads, on the pane's private clock that runs only while the
//! frame is shown (decision 2007). The sprite this module used to draw in their place (1596/1599's
//! byte-measured re-expression of those quads) is gone with it, and so is the world-map ping gap
//! 1980 named: `WorldMapPing` is the same file on the map sheet.
//!
//! What is *not* a lifetime: proximity. The first version applied the client's 10-yd
//! `d² < 100` auto-clear to the party ping, and that clear belongs to the **`SMSG_GOSSIP_POI`
//! marker** — a different feature in a different slot (wow-re `party-group-wire.md` §TU-D
//! corrects it explicitly). Walking to your own ping used to delete it mid-hold.
