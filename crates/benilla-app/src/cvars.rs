//! benilla's **CVar host** — registration, knob sync, and the client's first persistence
//! (decision 0954). The engine holds the table and the Lua API ([`benilla_ui::script`]'s
//! `GetCVar`/`SetCVar`); this module is everything host-side:
//!
//! - **The registered set** ([`REGISTERED`]): only vars something actually reads — a host knob,
//!   or (since 1140) a live Lua consumer, which is the same rule seen from the UI side and the
//!   only refinement the honest-tree law has needed. Defaults are the code's own truths — the sound quartet is the client's
//!   verified CVar registration defaults (wow-re `benilla-pins.md` B10, quoted in
//!   [`crate::sound::SoundConfig`]), `uiScale`/`farclip` are benilla's shipped defaults —
//!   and a test welds each string to the constant it mirrors so they cannot drift.
//! - **Boot**: read `benilla-config/config.toml` ([`crate::local_state`]) and apply it to the knob
//!   resources; when the UI VM exists, register the table and push the resolved session values
//!   so `GetCVar` answers what the client is actually doing.
//! - **Sync**: drain Lua `SetCVar` changes into the knob resources each frame and mark the
//!   config dirty.
//! - **Save**: dirty + one quiet second → rewrite `config.toml` atomically (and flush on
//!   `AppExit`). The file holds **only values that moved off their default** — a diff, not a
//!   dump — plus any entries this build doesn't know (a newer build's keys survive a downgrade;
//!   same posture for a hand-added key: preserved verbatim, warned once).
//!
//! **Env overrides win for the session and never touch the file**: `WOW_UI_SCALE`/`WOW_FARCLIP`
//! beat the loaded config (they exist to make taste iteration a relaunch — pinning one into the
//! config would make the A/B sticky), the session runs and saves around them, and the file keeps
//! whatever it already said for those keys.
