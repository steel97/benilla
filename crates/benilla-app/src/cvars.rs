//! benilla's **CVar registry** — the client's configuration store, host side (decisions 0954,
//! 2303). The reference keeps every player setting in one engine-side table
//! (`ConsoleVar.cpp`, a `TSHashTable<CVar>` of 0xc4-byte records: name, value, default, the
//! latch slot, and a change callback the owning subsystem hands `CVar::Register 0x63db90`).
//! This module is that table: [`Cvars`] holds the live value of every registered row, it is
//! what survives a VM replacement, and it is what `config.toml` is composed from. The script VM
//! carries a **mirror** of it for Lua's synchronous `GetCVar`/`SetCVar`
//! ([`benilla_ui::script::UiScript::seed_cvars`]); the mirror's writes ride a queue back here.
//!
//! - **The registered set** ([`REGISTERED`]): only vars something actually reads — a host knob,
//!   or (since 1140) a live Lua consumer. **A row's default is the REFERENCE's default**
//!   (decision 1804), and every row says where it stands against it — [`Registered::reference`],
//!   a mandatory column with no "unknown" variant. Two tests hold it: one checks each row's claim
//!   in both directions, the other pins the deviation set as a readable list. A row the reference
//!   **latches** (flag bit1 at its register site) says so with [`Registered::latched`]; a
//!   structural test insists every row has a reader somewhere in the source.
//!
//!   **The reference column has one source**: wow-re's
//!   `system/cvar/scratch/registered-defaults-census.md` and the regenerable manifest beside it,
//!   `re/cvar/cvar-register-sites.tsv` — all 214 of the reference's `CVar::Register` sites with
//!   name, help, flags, default string, callback, category and record global. A new row looks
//!   its answer up there rather than re-deriving it.
//!
//! - **The change callback is a Bevy observer** ([`CvarChanged`]). An accepted move of a row's
//!   applied value is triggered as one event, and the subsystem that owns the knob observes it
//!   beside the knob (`sound::on_cvar`, `video::on_cvar`, …), writing only its own resource — so
//!   `Res::is_changed()` on a knob is honest again, which the 32-resource bundle this replaced
//!   could not offer (it deref-mutted every knob on every write; three consumers carried the
//!   written workaround). The registry never applies anything itself: it has no knob, and no arm.
//!
//! - **The latch** ([`Row::pending`]): a write to a latched row is staged, `GetCVar` keeps
//!   answering the applied value, and nothing fires until [`Cvars::commit_latched`] — which is
//!   the reference's `CVar::Update 0x63e060`, called for the `gx*` rows from inside `RestartGx`
//!   (the video window's Okay). A staged value that is never committed is dropped at exit, as
//!   the reference's is (`SaveConfig` writes `rec+0x20`, the applied value).
//!
//! - **Boot**: read `benilla-config/config.toml` ([`crate::local_state`]) into the registry and
//!   fire the observers synchronously, before anything ordered after [`CvarLoad`] runs; when the
//!   UI VM exists, seed its mirror from the registry so `GetCVar` answers what the client is doing.
//! - **Sync**: per frame, drain the VM's registrations and writes into the registry, push the
//!   registry's own writes into the mirror, and trigger the accepted moves.
//! - **Save**: dirty + one quiet second → rewrite `config.toml` atomically (and flush on
//!   `AppExit`). The file holds **only values that moved off their default** — a diff, not a
//!   dump — plus any entries this build doesn't know (a newer build's keys, an addon's before it
//!   registers them: preserved verbatim, warned once).
//!
//! **Env overrides win for the session and never touch the file**: `WOW_UI_SCALE`/`WOW_FARCLIP`
//! and their siblings beat the loaded config (they exist to make taste iteration a relaunch —
//! pinning one into the config would make the A/B sticky), the session runs and saves around
//! them, and the file keeps whatever it already said for those keys ([`Cvars::own_for_session`]).

        //     and is reported raw, because `OptionsFrame.lua:124` matches it against

        //     `Interface\Cursor\*.blp` into an OS cursor on every target (an `NSCursor` on macOS,
        //     winit's `CursorIcon::Custom` elsewhere).
