//! The auction house's mail seam — how a mail from the auction house stops being
//! `4428:0:1` / `6C:10000:10000` and becomes "Auction won: Small Blue Pouch" over a receipt.
//!
//! **The invoice is TEXT.** Nothing structured rides the wire: the auction house writes its numbers
//! into the mail's *subject* and *body* as colon-separated fields, and the client parses them back
//! out. That is not an emulator shortcut — it is what the real 1.12 client does, byte-verified
//! (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/auction-house.md` §11.1a: `0x4ace70` for the subject,
//! `GetInboxInvoiceInfo 0x4af360` for the body).
//!
//! Two halves, and they answer different questions from different places:
//!
//! * **The subject says WHAT HAPPENED.** `<itemEntry>:<randomProperty>:<resultCode>` — five outcomes
//!   over six codes. The client parses it, formats the matching `AUCTION_*_MAIL_SUBJECT`
//!   GlobalString with the item's name, and writes the result back over the *displayed* subject, so
//!   the inbox list and the open letter both read it. The raw triplet is never shown.
//! * **The body says HOW MUCH**, and only for the two outcomes that move money: won (`1`) and sold
//!   (`2`). The other four carry no body at all, which is why an outbid notice has no invoice and
//!   why [`parse_body`] is only ever asked about those two.
//!
//! The identity comes from the subject and the numbers come from the body — so a mail can be
//! recognisably "Auction won: X" in the inbox list while its invoice is still unanswerable, because
//! the body is fetched lazily (`CMSG_ITEM_TEXT_QUERY`) when the letter is opened.
