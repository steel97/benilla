//! The app-side **honor feed** (decision 1512) — the local player's PRIVATE honor descriptor
//! fields turned into the snapshot both Honor tabs read, the inspect-honor request/reply round
//! trip, and the `SMSG_PVP_CREDIT` award turned into its chat line and floating number.
//!
//! The display law lives in `benilla-ui`'s `script::pvp`; this is the **data** law it consumes,
//! and there are three pieces of it.
//!
//! ## 1 · The self snapshot is one descriptor read, and every field of it is PRIVATE
//!
//! The whole honor block (`PLAYER_FIELD_SESSION_KILLS` … `PLAYER_FIELD_BYTES2`) streams for
//! nobody but the local player, so there is no per-unit form of this feed and there cannot be one.
//! What a *foreign* player exposes is exactly two things — the PUBLIC current-rank byte, which
//! rides [`crate::ui_unit`]'s snapshot, and whatever `MSG_INSPECT_HONOR_STATS` chooses to answer.
//! That asymmetry is the shape of the entire arc.
//!
//! ## 2 · The two events are a field diff, and the reference watches **exactly three fields**
//!
//! The pane repaints on `PLAYER_PVP_KILLS_CHANGED` and `PLAYER_PVP_RANK_CHANGED`, which the real
//! engine fires from field watches. wow-re carved the watch table (`0x467e70`, callback
//! `0x5de4b0` carrying the event id) and there are **three registrations and no more**:
//!
//! | watched | fires |
//! |---|---|
//! | `PLAYER_FIELD_SESSION_KILLS` | `PLAYER_PVP_KILLS_CHANGED` (523) |
//! | `PLAYER_BYTES_3` | `PLAYER_PVP_RANK_CHANGED` (524) |
//! | `PLAYER_FIELD_BYTES2` byte 0 | `PLAYER_PVP_RANK_CHANGED` (524) |
//!
//! **Nothing watches the yesterday / this-week / last-week / lifetime / contribution fields, and
//! nothing watches `+0x102b` (the highest-lifetime rank).** That is not an omission in the client;
//! it is *why* `HonorFrame.lua` refreshes those rows on `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` alone. The two
//! facts are one fact, and a feed that fired `KILLS_CHANGED` on a lifetime total — which this one
//! did until the verdict landed — would be firing an event the real client has no source for.
//!
//! One divergence, stated: the reference watches the **whole `PLAYER_BYTES_3` dword**, so a
//! drunkenness change fires `PLAYER_PVP_RANK_CHANGED` there too. We watch byte 3 alone. The
//! repaint that spurious fire produces is byte-identical to the one before it, so the difference
//! is unobservable; carrying the other three bytes in an honor snapshot to reproduce it would cost
//! a field nothing reads.
//!
//! ## 3 · The inspect round trip is a real one, unlike `CMSG_INSPECT`
//!
//! 0631's inspect request is fire-and-forget: the gear was already streamed and `SMSG_INSPECT`
//! echoes the guid. This one is the opposite — `MSG_INSPECT_HONOR_STATS` is the *only* source of
//! another player's honor numbers, the reply rides the **same opcode** as the request, and the
//! reference's pane gates on `HasInspectHonorData()` precisely because the data may not be here
//! yet. So: the pane asks, we resolve the inspect target's guid and send, the reply lands in
//! [`InspectHonor`], and `INSPECT_HONOR_UPDATE` tells the pane to repaint.
//!
//! **A refusal is silent by construction.** The server answers nothing when the target is gone,
//! out of the 10-yard `INSPECT_DISTANCE`, or attackable (`MiscHandler.cpp:962-977`) — there is no
//! error shape on this opcode. The pane's own `OnShow` re-asks whenever it holds nothing, which is
//! the reference's retry and the only one there is.
