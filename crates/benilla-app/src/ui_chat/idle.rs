//! **The idle handler** — `WorldFrame::Render 0x482ea0`, the one reference function that watches
//! how long it has been since the player last touched anything and does three unrelated-looking
//! things about it (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/standstate-movement-trigger.md` §5.4 and
//! `ui/scratch/afk-dnd-command-law.md` §10/§12).
//!
//! One module because it is **one timer**, read once per frame against one global stamp, with a
//! three-way branch hung off it:
//!
//! | idle | what happens |
//! |---|---|
//! | `< 300 000 ms` | nothing at all — `0x482ed8 jl 0x482fbf` leaves the whole block |
//! | `300 000 – 1 799 999 ms` | **auto-sit** (`0x482f91 call 0x5ed430(1)`), then **auto-AFK** (`0x482fba call 0x5eb740(NULL)`) |
//! | `>= 1 800 000 ms` | print `IDLE_MESSAGE`, then `0x5ab000` — and pointedly **no** sit and **no** AFK |
//!
//! Both thresholds are read off the immediates: `0x482ecd lea ecx,[eax-0x493e0]` is `-300 000`, and
//! `0x482ede add eax,0xffe488c0` is `-1 800 000`.
//!
//! **The 30-minute leg is a CAMP, not a kick.** `0x5ab000` is `ClientServices::SendLogout(flag,
//! force)` (wow-re `system/net/ledger.tsv`) — the *same* function the game menu's Logout button
//! reaches through `Logout 0x489390`, sending `CMSG_LOGOUT_REQUEST 0x4B`. So the server decides:
//! it refuses outright in combat, logs you out instantly in an inn, and otherwise runs the
//! twenty-second countdown that [`crate::ui_logout`] already narrates as the CAMP dialog. A
//! re-implementation that tore the socket down here would be both unfaithful and much ruder than
//! the thing it was imitating.
//!
//! **Nothing here needs a latch of its own, because every leg is gated on the state it is about to
//! create.** The sit is refused once seated, the auto-AFK is gated on the mirror `[0xb6e5cc] == 0`
//! and sets it, and the logout request is swallowed by the dispatcher's own pending byte
//! `[session+0x1b1d]`. That self-limiting shape is the reference's, and it is why a handler that
//! runs every single frame for twenty-five minutes does not spam the wire.
//!
//! The third of those did not exist here until this landed. [`crate::ui_logout`] knew about
//! `[session+0x1b1d]` in prose and never modelled it, because the only caller was a button a human
//! presses once; a caller that asks sixty times a second is what made the gap load-bearing. It is
//! built where the reference has it — in the dispatcher, covering every caller — rather than as a
//! private flag here.

/// - Zero-motion moves and the pump's synthetic hover re-pick (`0x7660d0`'s `0x766122`–`0x766140`
