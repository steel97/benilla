//! The slash-command **table** (decision 0881): every `/command` the client answers, built at boot
//! from the reference's OWN alias strings rather than hand-typed here.
//!
//! ## Why a table
//!
//! `ChatEdit_ParseText` (ChatFrame.lua l.2163-2199) resolves a typed command in three passes, and
//! **none of them holds a literal**: the chat-type switches walk `SLASH_<ChatTypeInfo index><n>`,
//! the actions walk `SLASH_<SlashCmdList index><n>`, and the emotes walk `EMOTE<i>_CMD<j>` →
//! `EMOTE<i>_TOKEN` → `DoEmote(token)`. The aliases are DATA (`GlobalStrings.lua`), the handlers
//! are code, and the two are joined by an index name.
//!
//! Benilla used to re-type each command's aliases into a Rust `match` as its system was built.
//! Every alias nobody happened to copy was a command that silently did not exist: the audit behind
//! 0881 found **61 live reference aliases dead** (`/lol`, `/hi`, `/ty`, `/congrats`, `/sorry`,
//! `/yes`, `/bravo`, …) because the emote arm matched the *`EmotesText.dbc` name* instead of the
//! alias table — and four names the reference has NO command for (`/joke`, `/puzzle`,
//! `/attackmytarget`, and `/follow`, which fired a text emote where the real client follows your
//! target) answering as emotes. A table keyed on the shipped strings cannot have that class of bug:
//! registering a handler is naming its index, and the aliases come from the data.
//!
//! ## Where each half comes from
//!
//! - **`SLASH_<INDEX><n>`** — the real `GlobalStrings.lua`, already executed into the UI VM at boot
//!   (`crate::ui_script`). One [`SlashIndex`] per command benilla implements; the reference's own
//!   index name is the key.
//! - **`EMOTE<i>_CMD<j>` / `EMOTE<i>_TOKEN`** — the alias→token join, also read off the VM globals
//!   (`crate::ui_script::load_emote_tokens` runs the token half's data lines out of the shipped
//!   `ChatFrame.lua`). The token resolves to an `EmotesText` id through the emote catalog.
//! - **benilla's own instruments** ([`DevCmd`]) — `/castvis`, `/chattest`, `/shot`, … have no
//!   reference strings because they are not reference commands; their aliases are literals here,
//!   the one place in this module where that is honest.
//!
//! Precedence is the reference's resolution ORDER, made static at insert time: a slash index wins
//! over an emote alias of the same name (the reference reaches `SlashCmdList` first), and benilla's
//! instruments are inserted last so they can never shadow a real command.
