//! The combat log's chat lines — the content pipeline decision 0288 §3 named out of its own scope
//! ("transcribing ATTACKERSTATEUPDATE/spell-log packets into COMBATHIT strings is the combat-log
//! arc"), and B297 is the bill for leaving it. The wire has been decoded for a long time; it fed
//! the floating numbers, the portrait indicator and the center text, and produced **no chat at
//! all**, which is why a damage meter or Quiver's TranqAnnouncer sees nothing to parse.
//!
//! This module is the reference's `UnitCombatLog_C` TU (`~0x625000-0x62e7xx`, wow-re
//! `object-layer/scratch/w2f2.md`), the presentation half: it owns **no** arithmetic, only the
//! composition — classify both endpoints, pick a chat type, pick a GlobalString *key*, fill it.
//! The reference's own chain is four hops and we take the same four:
//!
//! ```text
//!   packet  →  classify(attacker), classify(victim)   →  0..9  (the range table names them)
//!           →  msgType selector                       →  the chat type  (0x5e = drop)
//!           →  format-string selector                 →  a GlobalString KEY + a variant code
//!           →  FrameScript_GetText(key) → vsnprintf    →  the line
//! ```
//!
//! **We ship keys, never Blizzard's text.** The reference's selectors (`0x62a290`, `0x629f90`, the
//! other 43) return the *name* of a localized template; `0x703bf0` (`FrameScript_GetText`) resolves
//! it, and when it comes back empty `0x6269f0` prints "Warning: string %s not found" instead of a
//! line. benilla already runs the player's own `Interface\FrameXML\GlobalStrings.lua` into the VM
//! at boot ([`crate::ui_script`]'s `load_global_strings`), so [`global_string`] is that same hop:
//! the key is ours, the text is the install's. That is the licence-clean shape *and* the faithful
//! one — and it is why a non-enUS install gets its own language for free.
//!
//! **The slot orders are the one thing we author.** A family's format string is Blizzard's, but
//! which value lands in which `%s`/`%d` is a fact about that string, and we state it as an ordered
//! [`Slot`] list. Two properties make that safe rather than fragile: within a family the order is
//! **invariant across the four variants** (the variant only decides whether the `Attacker`/`Victim`
//! slots are *present* — "Your %s hits %s for %d." and "%s's %s hits %s for %d." are the same list
//! with one slot dropped), and [`tests`] fills every declared family against the *real*
//! `GlobalStrings.lua` and checks the `%s`/`%d` type signature it produces matches the shipped
//! template's. A transposition cannot survive that; a drift cannot either.
