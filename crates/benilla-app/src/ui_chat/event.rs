//! The chat arc's internal currency (decision 0288 §1): [`ChatEvent`] mirrors the reference
//! client's `CHAT_MSG_*` event + `arg1..argN` shape as typed fields, so every source — the wire
//! (`SMSG_MESSAGECHAT`, `SMSG_CHANNEL_NOTIFY`, whisper-fail errors, `SMSG_TEXT_EMOTE`) and the
//! client-composed feeds (loot receive lines, played time, rolls) — speaks one vocabulary, and
//! the router/composer ([`super::frames`]) is the single place lines are formatted, colored, and
//! fanned across the docked windows.
//!
//! The kind set is the renderable subset of the reference's `ChatTypeInfo` (its `COMBAT_*`/
//! `SPELL_*` block is the combat-log content arc, deliberately out — 0288 §3, except
//! `COMBAT_XP_GAIN`, pulled in by the ding arc 0304: the XP line is part of leveling feedback);
//! the group tables are `ChatTypeGroup` transcribed; the colors are the complete shipped default
//! table (the ref client's own `chat-cache.txt` COLORS block ≡ wow-re's byte-verified
//! `.rdata 0x804710` table, double-sourced in 0288's pin).
//!
//! This module also carries the **Lua face** of that currency: [`event_name`]
//! (kind → the reference's `CHAT_MSG_*` event name) and [`ChatEvent::script_args`] (the ten
//! positional args the client's own fire helper passes). 0288 §1 left that door open in its own
//! words — *"a future 0068 addon-API phase can move it into the VM (fire CHAT_MSG_* events at Lua)
//! without touching sources or sinks"* — and this is that phase: the router
//! ([`super::frames::route`]) now fires the real event beside the Rust render, so an addon sees the
//! same chat the window does.

/// | 3 | `language` | already a *name* ("Orcish"); empty = no header (l.1442) |
//
// (arg3's empty case, checked rather than assumed: l.1442 also guards `arg3 ~= "Universal"`, which
// reads like the client passes that word for language 0. It does not — "Universal" is in neither
// `Languages.dbc` (13 rows, ids 1-33, no 0) nor `WoW.exe` nor `GlobalStrings.lua`, so that arm is
// vestigial in 1.12 and `strlen(arg3) > 0` is what actually suppresses the header. Our
// [`language_name`] answering "" for 0 is therefore the right shape, not a shortcut.)
/// | 4 | `channel` | the display form, "N. Name - Zone" when numbered (l.1373, l.1463) |
/// | 5 | `target` | the second name of a two-name notice — "X kicked by Y" (l.1414-1416) |
/// | 6 | `flag` | "AFK"/"DND"/"GM", empty none; read as `CHAT_FLAG_<flag>` (l.1431) |
/// | 7 | `zone_channel_id` | the **`ChatChannels.dbc` ChannelID** behind a zone channel, 0 for a custom one — matched against `ChatFrame.zoneChannelList` (l.1379) |
/// | 8 | `channel_number` | the client-local joined-channel slot; `ChatTypeInfo["CHANNEL"..arg8]` (l.1381) |
/// | 9 | `channel_base` | the channel name **without** the leading number (l.1378's own comment) |
/// | 10 | — (always 0) | the channel's **split/instance index**, appended as `arg4.." "..arg10` when `> 0` (l.1421-1423) |
///
/// **arg10 is deliberately not a field.** It is `slot+0x98`, the same value `GetChannelName`
/// returns third, and its wire source is the **second** `u32` of `SMSG_CHANNEL_NOTIFY`'s YOU_JOINED
/// tail — the one `Channel::MakeYouJoined` (`Chat/Channel.cpp:823-827`) hardcodes to 0 with the

/// l.1421-1423 exactly. (The *first* u32 of that tail is the channel flags, which the client reads
/// and discards.) Our decode already drops the second for that reason
/// (`ChannelNoticeTail::YouJoined`), so [`ChatEvent::script_args`] passes the literal 0 rather than
/// carrying a field that can only ever hold it.
///
/// **arg4/arg7/arg8/arg9 are one record**, all `""`/`0`/`0`/`""` together when the channel is not
/// in the local list — see [`super::edit::ChannelState::stamp_channel`], which is the only place

///
/// **arg1 IS the garbled text** (B262, decision 1485). The reference fills `0x49a870`'s one buffer
/// exactly once — a plain `SStrCopy` at `0x49a9f0` or the garble `0x49b560` at `0x49aa7c` — and
