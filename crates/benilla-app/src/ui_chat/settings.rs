//! The chat windows' **saved state** — the background tint, the background alpha and the font size
//! the player picks off a chat tab's right-click menu (decision 1589, fixing **B246**: *"no chat
//! options at all — background transparency has no home, and chat can be hard to read"*), plus the
//! window's **lock**, which joined them when the windows became movable and resizable.
//!
//! The state itself lives in the VM ([`benilla_ui::script::ChatWindowLook`], written by the
//! reference's own `SetChatWindowColor`/`SetChatWindowAlpha`/`SetChatWindowSize` and read straight
//! back out of `GetChatWindowInfo`); this module is the two ends the VM cannot own — **where it
//! comes from at login and where it goes at logout**.
//!
//! ## Character-scoped, like the reference
//!
//! 1.12 keeps these in `WTF/Account/<ACC>/<REALM>/<CHAR>/chat-cache.txt`, whose per-window block a
//! stock client writes as
//!
//! ```text
//! WINDOW 1   SIZE 0  COLOR 0 0 0 0  LOCKED 1  DOCKED 1  SHOWN 1
//! ```
//!
//! `LOCKED` is an `i32` in the record (`CHATWINDOW+0x8c`) but the cache writer booleanises it
//! through `setne`, so only `{0,1}` round-trip there — which is why ours is a `bool` and writes the
//! same two digits.
//!
//! `COLOR` there is **R G B A**, written from the record's packed BGRA quad and parsed straight
//! back as bytes, so the reference's own file round-trip is bit-exact (§5,
//! wow-re `system/ui/scratch/chat-window-record.md`). Ours writes the same four in the same order.
//!
//! **Its loader's `WINDOW` bound is off by one** — `0x498d1c` uses `ja` where the array wants
//! `jae`, so a hand-edited `WINDOW 11` writes a full record past the end at `0xb50440` (the same
//! §5 found it, incidentally). Ours cannot: the index is bounds-checked at the seam that consumes
//! it (`set_chat_window_looks` uses `get_mut`), and an out-of-range window is simply dropped.
//!
//! (the real file from the pin's install, quoted in
//! [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `chat_window` module docs). Ours is
//! `benilla-config/chat/<realm>-<character>.txt` ([`crate::local_state::chat_character_path`]) —
//! the camera pose's shape one folder over (decision 1131/1138), with the reference's own key
//! spellings and its own byte-valued `COLOR r g b a`, so the file reads as a narrower relative of
//! its ancestor rather than as an invention.
//!
//! **It is deliberately a SUBSET and says so in its header.** The reference's cache also carries
//! `DOCKED`/`SHOWN`, the per-window `MESSAGES`/`CHANNELS` registration and the whole `COLORS`
//! table; benilla has no rename, no undock and no per-type colour editor (0288 §2), so writing
//! those keys would persist state nothing can move — the honest-tree rule (1134 §4) at the
//! persistence layer. Each joins the file the day something can change it, **which is exactly what
//! `LOCKED` just did**: the tab menu's *Lock/Unlock Window* row moves it, so a file that dropped it
//! would reset the player's unlocked window at every login.
//!
//! ## Why per character, and not a CVar
//!
//! Both halves matter. *Per character*, because it is where the reference puts it and because it
//! is what the setting means — a raid alt reading a 40-man combat log wants a solid box where a
//! questing alt wants glass. And *not a CVar*, because `SetChatWindowAlpha` is the API 1.12 addons
//! are written against: an addon that reads a window's alpha calls `GetChatWindowInfo`, and
//! routing benilla's store through `config.toml` instead would have given the same player setting
//! two different names depending on who asked.
//!
//! ## The write posture
//!
//! **Debounced by one quiet second, plus both session edges** — the colour picker's opacity slider
//! drives `FCF_SetChatWindowOpacity` on *every drag step*, so this is a slider, not a discrete
//! edit: [`crate::cvars`]'s `SAVE_QUIET` reasoning applies verbatim ("long enough to coalesce a
//! slider drag, short enough that a crash loses one gesture, not a session"). The edges are
//! `OnExit(InWorld)` and `AppExit`, the same two the camera pose and the saved variables use.
