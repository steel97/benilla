//! The chat windows' **saved state** — the whole `chat-cache.txt` record: the per-type colour
//! table and, per window, the tint, alpha, font size, lock, dock, shown flag, name, the message
//! types it shows and the channels it carries (decisions 1589 → 1714 → 1948).
//!
//! The state itself lives in the VM ([`benilla_ui::script::ChatWindowLook`] and the chat-type
//! registry, written by the reference's own `SetChatWindow*`, `Add/RemoveChatWindowMessages`,
//! `Add/RemoveChatWindowChannel`, `ChangeChatColor`, and read straight back out of
//! `GetChatWindowInfo`/`GetChatWindowMessages`/`GetChatWindowChannels`/`GetChatTypeIndex`); this
//! module is the two ends the VM cannot own — **where it comes from at login and where it goes at
//! logout**.
//!
//! ## The grammar is the reference's
//!
//! 1.12 keeps these in `WTF/Account/<ACC>/<REALM>/<CHAR>/chat-cache.txt`, written whole by
//! `0x499a80` and read by `0x498a60` (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/chat-cache-grammar.md`, §1 and
//! §3 — every line below is that note's):
//!
//! ```text
//! VERSION 2
//! ADDEDVERSION 2
//! OPTION_GUILD_RECRUITMENT_CHANNEL AUTO
//! CHANNELS                 ← the custom channels the client is in, re-joined at login
//! MyChannel
//! END
//! ZONECHANNELS 18874371    ← the joined zone channels, as bits 1<<(ChannelID-1)
//! COLORS                   ← the chat-type registry, R G B bytes
//! SAY 255 255 255
//! …
//! END
//!
//! WINDOW 1
//! NAME General             ← only when a name was stored (name[0] != 0)
//! SIZE 0
//! COLOR 0 0 0 0            ← R G B A bytes, from the record's packed BGRA quad
//! LOCKED 1
//! DOCKED 1
//! SHOWN 1
//!
//! MESSAGES                 ← the enabled groups of the 68-entry CHATMSGGROUP table, table order
//! SYSTEM
//! …
//! END
//! CHANNELS                 ← this window's CUSTOM channels only — a zone channel is never a name
//! END
//! ZONECHANNELS 18874371    ← this window's zone channels, as bits, masked by the joined set
//! END
//! ```
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating. **The file is the sole source**: the loader zeroes every
//! window's flags before parsing, so a `MESSAGES` block is the set, not an addition — and a
//! window the file does not mention keeps the boot init ([`ChatWindowLook::stock`]). **Zone
//! channels are bits, not names**: the record stores the DBC Shortcut (`General`) with its id,
//! the file stores the bit, and the loader's in-window `ZONECHANNELS` arm turns bits back into
//! `(Shortcut, id)` rows. A file older than `ADDEDVERSION 2` gets the groups added since
//! back-filled (`COMBAT_FACTION_CHANGE`, `MONEY` — into window 2), exactly as the loader does.
//!
//! Ours is `benilla-config/chat/<realm>-<character>.txt`
//! ([`crate::local_state::chat_character_path`]) in that grammar, so a stock file reads here and
//! ours reads there. The reader is as lenient as the reference's — case-insensitive keys, an
//! unknown key skipped rather than failing the line, blank lines nothing — and still accepts the
//! one-line `WINDOW 1  SIZE 0  COLOR …` rows the files written before 1948 hold, so no player's
//! saved looks are lost to the grammar change.
//!
//! `LOCKED` is an `i32` in the record (`CHATWINDOW+0x8c`) but the cache writer booleanises it
//! through `setne`, so only `{0,1}` round-trip there — which is why ours is a `bool`.
//!
//! **The loader's `WINDOW` bound is off by one in the reference** — `0x498d1c` uses `ja` where the
//! array wants `jae`. Ours cannot: the index is bounds-checked at the seam that consumes it
//! (`set_chat_window_looks` uses `get_mut`), and an out-of-range window is simply dropped.
//!
//! ## The login events
//!
//! The loader fires `UPDATE_CHAT_WINDOWS` once and then `UPDATE_CHAT_COLOR` for **every** registry
//! entry — file or no file (§8). The first is what `FloatingChatFrame_Update` docks, hides and
//! colours the windows from; the second is how a saved colour reaches `ChatTypeInfo` and repaints
//! the lines already in the window (`ChatFrame_OnEvent`'s arm). So does ours, once per character
//! per VM.
//!
//! ## Why per character, and not a CVar
//!
//! Both halves matter. *Per character*, because it is where the reference puts it and because it
//! is what the setting means — a raid alt reading a 40-man combat log wants a solid box where a
//! questing alt wants glass. And *not a CVar*, because `SetChatWindowAlpha` is the API 1.12 addons
//! are written against: an addon that reads a window's alpha calls `GetChatWindowInfo`, and
//! routing benilla's store through `config.toml` instead would have given the same player setting
//! two different names depending on who asked.
//!
//! ## The write posture
//!
//! **Debounced by one quiet second, plus both session edges** — the colour picker's opacity slider
//! drives `FCF_SetChatWindowOpacity` on *every drag step*, so this is a slider, not a discrete
//! edit: [`crate::cvars`]'s `SAVE_QUIET` reasoning applies verbatim ("long enough to coalesce a
//! slider drag, short enough that a crash loses one gesture, not a session"). The edges are
//! `OnExit(InWorld)` and `AppExit`, the same two the camera pose and the saved variables use.
