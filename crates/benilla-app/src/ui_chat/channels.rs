//! The zone-channel auto-join (decision 0288 phase 6's remainder) — the client half of a
//! handshake the server deliberately does not perform.
//!
//! **Nobody joins these for you.** vmangos's `Player::UpdateLocalChannels`
//! (`src/game/Objects/Player.cpp:5121`) is an empty function whose entire body is the comment
//! `// Updated client-side`, so a client that never sends `CMSG_JOIN_CHANNEL` sits in no channel
//! at all — silently, because nothing on the wire complains. That is what benilla did until now:
//! `/join` worked, and General/Trade/LocalDefense simply never existed.
//!
//! The walk is [`ChatChannels.dbc`](benilla_formats::ChatChannelsCatalog)'s `INITIAL` rows
//! composed against the player's current **zone** and sent as ordinary joins. It re-runs whenever
//! the zone (or the in-a-capital answer) changes: the zone-dependent rows carry the zone name
//! *inside* the channel name, so crossing a border is genuinely leaving one channel and joining
//! another — LEAVE(old) then JOIN(new), interleaved per DBC row.
//!
//! The mechanism is byte-verified in wow-re's `system/ui/scratch/zone-chat-channel-autojoin.md`
//! (the whole thing is one function, `ZoneChannelRefresh 0x49a210`); each part below cites the
//! section it comes from.
//!
//! ## Why this is worth more than three channel names
//!
//! The server answers each join with `SMSG_CHANNEL_NOTIFY`/`YOU_JOINED`, which becomes a
//! `CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL_NOTICE` at the Lua VM (0288 §1's addon-API phase) — and that one event is the
//! condition for **Ace2's initialisation gate**. `AceEvent`'s `activate` registers
//! `CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL_NOTICE` and, on the first one, schedules the function that sets
//! `self.postInit = true` and fires `AceEvent_FullyInitialized`
//! (`AceEvent-2.0.lua:913-947`). Until that happens `AceEvent:IsFullyInitialized()` answers false
//! forever, with no error anywhere — and ~75 FuBar plugins, BigWigs, oRA2, RosterLib, Jostle and
//! AceComm all wait on it. `ui_chat::ace_gate_tests` is that claim, proved against the corpus's
//! own Ace2 chain.
