//! The `AUTO_JOIN_GUILD_CHANNEL` cascade — the reference's `0x49ea90`, the thing
//! `SetGuildRecruitmentMode(1)` tail-jumps into and the one place the client joins or leaves
//! `GuildRecruitment - City` on its own (decision 2144; every byte fact below is wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/guild-recruitment-mode.md`, a §5 round, and its callers' census in
//! `zone-chat-channel-autojoin.md` §11.5).
//!
//! **What it is for.** `GuildRecruitment` is the channel *unguilded* players sit in to be found.
//! Its `ChatChannels.dbc` row carries no `INITIAL` bit, so the zone walk never seeds it; instead
//! the option's latch (`[0x843608]`, `1` = AUTO, the shipped default) drives a cascade that reads
//! the local player's own `PLAYER_GUILDID` and acts on the wire:
//!
//! - **guilded** ⇒ leave-by-name `"GuildRecruitment - City"` (`0x49eb17` → `0x49ee70`):
//!   `CMSG_LEAVE_CHANNEL`, the channel stripped from every chat window's list, its `ZONECHANNELS`
//!   bit cleared, then `UPDATE_CHAT_WINDOWS`. **No already-a-member check.**
//! - **unguilded, in a capital** (`AreaTable Flags & 0x100`) ⇒ join `"GuildRecruitment"`
//!   (`0x49eb55` → `0x49eb70`): a slot, the composed name into chat window 1's list,
//!   `CMSG_JOIN_CHANNEL`, then `UPDATE_CHAT_WINDOWS`. **No already-joined check.**
//! - **otherwise** — no resolvable zone row, or unguilded outside a capital ⇒ the one-shot
//!   `[0xb6e5e4]` is armed and `ZoneChannelRefresh`'s tail consumes it on the next walk
//!   (`0x49a6a4`–`0x49a6b2`).
//!
//! Once the join confirms, the server's `YOU_JOINED` ORs bit 24 into the mask (`0x49bbaf`), and
//! from then on **the zone walk owns the channel exactly like Trade** — registered before the
//! gate, suspended outside a capital, re-joined on the way back in through the state-3 bypass
//! ([`super::channels::plan_walk`]). The cascade is the *entry*, not the upkeep.
//!
//! **Triggers** (`0x49ea90`'s closed caller census, §4.2): `SetGuildRecruitmentMode(1)`; the
//! chat-cache loader seating `AUTO`; the local player's `PLAYER_GUILDID` field-change watcher
//! (`0x5e2770`); and every `CGPlayer` create (`0x5dec1e`) — which includes the local player's own
//! at login. Ours: the Lua verb's ask, and a watcher over the local player's guild id whose first
//! sight of it *is* the create. The loader's call is subsumed (the watcher fires after the seat,
//! never before, because the walk's zone — which the cascade waits on — resolves only after the
//! world-entry load). **The per-*remote*-player re-fire is deliberately not modelled**: on the
//! bytes a guilded player re-sends the LEAVE every time another player streams in, which vmangos
//! answers "Not on channel" — a notice the stock `ChatFrame_OnEvent` then drops, because no slot
//! and no window carries the channel (`found == 0`). Invisible on screen, a packet per player on
//! the wire, and a quirk of where the hook sits rather than a behaviour; recorded in 2144.
//!
//! **Retry, generalised.** The reference arms a one-shot and the walk's tail consumes it on the
//! next zone change. Ours keeps the request pending and re-evaluates on every frame the zone
//! resolves; the observable is the same — it acts on the first zone change into a capital — and
//! it does not depend on the walk happening to run.
