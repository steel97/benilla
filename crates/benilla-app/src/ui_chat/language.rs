//! **The language gate** — everything that decides *whether* a chat line is garbled, and by how
//! much. The substitution itself is [`benilla_formats::garble`] (the reference's `0x49b560`); this
//! module is `0x49a870`'s share of the work: the exemptions, and the "how well does this character
//! know that language" answer the routine takes as its second argument.
//!
//! Byte-verified in wow-re `system/ui/scratch/chat-language-scramble.md` §8. The chain is entirely
//! client-side over server-synced skill data — **nothing is pushed as a "language list"**:
//!
//! ```text
//! language id ──(the spell whose Effect_1 == 39 declares it, over the KNOWN spells)──▶ spell id
//!             ──(that spell's SkillLineAbility row)──▶ SkillLine.dbc id
//!             ──(the player's PLAYER_SKILL_INFO block)──▶ skill value
//! ```
//!
//! Then `skill >= 300` is fluent and the line passes through untouched; below that every *word*
//! runs its own `hash % 300 < skill` test, so partial skill is graduated rather than a switch.
//!
//! **Why the first hop reads spell → language and not the reverse** is the shipped data, and it is
//! recorded on [`benilla_formats::SpellCatalog::declared_language`]: five spells declare Common
//! rather than their own language, so a whole-DBC map inverted the other way makes *Common* resolve
//! to Old Tongue and garbles everyone's own faction chat. Folding spell → language over the
//! character's own known-spell set is what the reference does (`0x4b2656` runs on spell *add*) and
//! it is the only shape that survives that data.
