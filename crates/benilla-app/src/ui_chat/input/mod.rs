//! The **submitted-line** side of the chat (decision 0288 P5) — what we DO about a line.
//! [`drain_chat_input`] routes each Entered line: a plain line sends as the box's CURRENT type (the
//! edit machine's law, [`super::edit`]); a `/`-line runs the Enter-path type switch, the reply arm,
//! then the action table. What a line *means* is [`parse`]'s ([`parse_line`] → [`ParsedChat`]);
//! which strings reach which arm is [`super::commands`]'s table.
//!
//! The emote arm is the client's `DoEmote` (`0x5ef560`) in full: the eligibility gate
//! ([`emote_send_eligible`]), the asleep gate, the stow, the **posture** branch that makes `/sit`
//! sit, then `CMSG_TEXT_EMOTE`. Opening keys + live parsing live in [`super::edit`]; the inbound
//! half is [`super::feed`]. Own sends are never echoed locally — the wire echoes back (vanilla
//! behavior).

/// Its own drain rather than a branch in [`drain_addon_chat_sends`] because the two queues carry
/// different things: a `SendChatMessage` line still needs a chat-type token resolved and may be
/// refused here, while a `SendAddonMessage` broadcast arrives **already validated** — the binding
/// owns the four-value whitelist, the `prefix` TAB `message` composition and the outside-a-raid
/// downgrade, exactly as the reference's `0x49f920` does, so nothing is left for this side to
/// decide. That is why there is no "unknown distribution" arm here and no way to add one: the
/// queue's own type is the enum.
///
/// **The lane is traced in both directions, under one tag.** An addon channel is invisible by
/// construction — it never reaches a chat frame, which is the entire point of `LANG_ADDON` — so
/// without a line here a broadcast that went out and one that never happened look identical from
/// our own logs, which is exactly how a silently-discarded wire body survives (method.md's rule
/// that new wire bodies are proved, not assumed). `net::apply::chat` already writes inbound addon
/// traffic to the `addon` trace tag; this writes the outbound half to the same tag, so
/// `WOW_MOVE_TRACE=<path> WOW_MOVE_TRACE_TAGS=addon` on a live run is the whole conversation in
/// one file, in order.
