//! The world broadcasts — the three that become chat lines, and the resolve pass they need first.
//!
//! `SMSG_ZONE_UNDER_ATTACK`, `SMSG_DEFENSE_MESSAGE` and `SMSG_SERVER_MESSAGE` arrive as ids and
//! fills, never as finished lines: an `AreaTable.dbc` id to name, a `ServerMessages.dbc` row to
//! format, and — for the two defense broadcasts — **the joined-channel list to walk**. That last one
//! is why they cannot ride [`super::feed`]'s drain: the walk needs the AreaTable catalog and the
//! zone under the player, which the chat drain does not hold. So the wire arms park them on
//! [`super::ChatLog`]'s second queue and this module's system resolves each into an ordinary
//! [`ChatEvent`], one frame earlier in the same schedule.
//!
//! ## The defense broadcasts are CHANNEL lines, not system lines
//!
//! This is the part a reimplementation gets wrong, and the reference is unambiguous about it. Both
//! handlers (`0x49dcc0` for ZONE_UNDER_ATTACK, `0x49de30` for DEFENSE_MESSAGE) end in the same
//! loop over the client's own joined-channel array (`[0xb4fe04]`, count `[0xb4fe00]`, stride
//! `0xa0` — wow-re `system/ui/scratch/chat-msg-event-args.md` §7 owns that record), delivering the
//! text once per surviving channel as chat type **`0xE` = `CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL`** with a NULL sender
//! and language `0`. `0x49de04` and `0x49df4c` are the **only two sites in the whole image** that
//! hand the composer a literal chat type `0xE`: engine-composed channel chat exists for these two
//! opcodes and nothing else. A channel survives when:
//!
//! - its slot is taken — `[e+0x00]` is the **1-based slot number**, `0` meaning free, not a
//!   liveness flag — and its join state is `joined` (`[e+0x9c] == 0`);
//! - its `ChatChannels.dbc` row exists and carries `DEFENSE` (`0x10000`) — `0x49dd94`
//!   `test ecx,0x10000`. In the shipped table that is exactly rows 22 (LocalDefense) and 23
//!   (WorldDefense);
//! - and, **if** the row also carries `ZONE_DEP` (`0x2` — LocalDefense but not WorldDefense), the
//!   broadcast's zone equals the player's current zone (`0x49dda4`
//!   `cmp ecx, ds:0xb6e5d0`).
//!
//! So a character who has joined neither channel sees **nothing at all**, and that is the faithful
//! answer rather than a dropped packet. The whole test is [`defense_targets`].
//!
//! **In practice that means LocalDefense alone**, and it is worth writing down because it later
//! reads as a bug: only rows 1, 2 and 22 carry `INITIAL`, so the auto-join walk never joins
//! **WorldDefense** — the reference does not either (its own `chat-cache.txt` persists
//! `ZONECHANNELS 0x200003`, General + Trade + LocalDefense). vmangos sends `SMSG_DEFENSE_MESSAGE`
//! to the whole *map*, but the client's filter narrows it to players standing in the broadcast's
//! zone unless they typed `/join WorldDefense` themselves. An Eastern Plaguelands tower capture
//! reaching only players in the Eastern Plaguelands is the mechanism working.
//!
//! **The zone compared is the PARENT.** Both handlers resolve the packet's id through
//! `AreaTable.dbc` and replace it with the row's parent (`[rec+0x8]`) when that is nonzero
//! (`0x49dd2b`, `0x49de80`) — so "Sentinel Hill is under attack!" is matched against *Westfall*, and
//! a player standing anywhere in Westfall hears it. ZONE_UNDER_ATTACK's *text* still names the
//! packet's own area, because the name is read off the row **before** the remap (`0x49dd05`).
//!
//! **A missing row is not the same refusal in the two handlers**, and that difference is
//! deliberate on the client's side: ZONE_UNDER_ATTACK bails outright (`0x49dcdc`/`0x49dce8`/
//! `0x49dcf9` all jump to the epilogue — with no row there is no name, so there is no line),
//! while DEFENSE_MESSAGE keeps its wire text and simply skips the remap (`0x49de8a`), leaving the
//! raw zone id as the comparison subject.
//!
//! ## `SMSG_SERVER_MESSAGE` is the ordinary one
//!
//! One `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` line (chat type `0xA`, `0x49e047`), composed by
//! [`benilla_formats::ServerMessagesCatalog::compose`] — the DBC row is the format string, the
//! packet's text is its `%s`, and a type with no row falls back to the client's own `"[%d]: %s"`.
//!
//! ## `SMSG_CHAT_RESTRICTED` is a system line too, and that is not the obvious answer
//!
//! Its arm reads nothing off the wire — `0x5e4a09` is `push 0x1c3; call 0x496720`, three
//! instructions — so the whole packet is "show message 451". benilla already models
//! `CGGameUI::DisplayError 0x496720` and its message registry
//! ([`crate::ui_action::MsgKind`]); what this packet needed was the two facts that registry
//! entry carries, and both are VERIFIED here:
//!
//! - **451 is `ERR_CHAT_RESTRICTED`.** The string `"ERR_CHAT_RESTRICTED"` (`0x83f6d4`) has exactly
//!   ONE pointer anywhere in the image, at `0x4882f1`, inside the table's initializer — and the
//!   record it is written into is `0xb4d7d4`, which is `0xb4b498 + 451 × 20` on the nose.
//! - **Its surface is the chat window, not the red toast.** The registrar `0x488410` stores its
//!   second argument at `[rec+0x04]`, and that call site pushes **`0`** — the arm `0x496822`, which
//!   ends `call 0x49a870` with `edx = [rec+0x10]`. That field is `esi` throughout the initializer,
//!   loaded once at `0x484cac` as **`0xA` = `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM`**. (Its neighbours in the same block
//!   — `ERR_MAIL_REACHED_CAP`, `ERR_INVALID_RAID_TARGET` — push `2`, the red line, which is what
//!   makes the `0` here a deliberate difference rather than a default.)
//!
//! So a trial account's whisper cap prints "Trial accounts cannot send unlimited tells…" into chat.
//! It is a dead letter against vmangos, which has no trial accounts and never sends it — but the
//! reference is the spec, and an opcode we drop is one we cannot notice arriving.
