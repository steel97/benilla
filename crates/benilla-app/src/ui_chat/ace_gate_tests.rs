//! **Ace2's initialisation gate, opened end to end** — the reason 0288 §1's chat-event fire and
//! 0288 phase 6's zone auto-join were worth doing together.
//!
//! ## The failure this closes
//!
//! `AceEvent:IsFullyInitialized()` is called by 85 of the 218 addons in the vanilla corpus, and
//! under benilla it answered **false forever** — with no Lua error anywhere, which is why it went
//! unnoticed. The consequences are all silent: RosterLib never scans, BigWigs and oRA2 are
//! complete no-ops, Jostle never repositions, AceComm refuses to join its channels, and FuBar's
//! bar stays permanently blank across ~75 `FuBar_*` plugins.
//!
//! The gate is `AceEvent-2.0.lua:913-947`. On a fresh load `self.postInit` is false, and exactly
//! three things can set it:
//!
//! | armed by | what it schedules |
//! |---|---|
//! | `CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL_NOTICE` | `func` after 0.05 s |
//! | `MEETINGSTONE_CHANGED` | `func` after 1 s |
//! | `LANGUAGE_LIST_CHANGED` → `MINIMAP_ZONE_CHANGED` | `func` after 1 s |
//!
//! `func` sets `postInit = true` and fires `AceEvent_FullyInitialized`. Of the three arming
//! events, `CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL_NOTICE` is the one that can honestly fire at login on a 1.12 server —
//! it is the server's answer to joining a channel. benilla fired **no** `CHAT_MSG_*` at all, and
//! joined **no** channels, so none of the three ever arrived.
//!
//! ## What this file proves, and how
//!
//! Against the corpus's own Ace2 chain, loaded in FuBar's `.toc` order into a VM with our whole
//! FrameXML under it — not a stub, because the thing under test is third-party library code and a
//! stub would only ever prove that our stub works.
//!
//! **Nothing from the corpus is committed**, and the tests skip cleanly on a machine without it
//! (see [`corpus`]) — a checkout with no addon folder must never go red here.
