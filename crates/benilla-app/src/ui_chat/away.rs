//! **`/afk` and `/dnd` — the client-side command law** (decision 2088; wow-re
//! `ui/scratch/afk-dnd-command-law.md`, a §5 trio incl. one cold derivation + orchestrator
//! arbitration).
//!
//! The two commands look like a pair and are not one. `SendChatMessage 0x49f1e0` handles them
//! **asymmetrically**, and the reference's own string pool shows why: the DND keys live in the chat
//! translation unit, the AFK keys in `Player_C.h`'s.
//!
//! - **DND** (`0x49f3de`-`0x49f591`) is inline, reads `PLAYER_FLAGS` bit `0x4` **live**, and falls
//!   through to the generic `CMSG_MESSAGECHAT` send.
//! - **AFK** (`0x49f4f3`-`0x49f562`) reads the client-side mirror [`AfkMirror`] — *not* the
//!   descriptor bit — and returns, delegating to `CGPlayer_C::SetAFK 0x5eb740` /
//!   `ClearAFK 0x5eb830`, which build their own packets.
//!
//! **The echo is OPTIMISTIC, never descriptor-driven** (§8): the print and the mirror write are
//! straight-line before the send. `0x5ee990`'s `test al,0xe` arm — the `PLAYER_FLAGS` delta arm
//! that carries AFK/DND/GM — calls only `0x6c78f0` (name invalidation) and `0x468550` between
//! `0x5ee9c0` and `0x5ee9f8`: no string resolve, no chat sink. So a client that waited for the
//! server's flag to come back before printing would be wrong, and would also print nothing at all
//! when the send is dropped.
//!
//! **All four lines are `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM`** (`0x49a870` with `edx = 0xa`; `[0x8062e0 + 4*0xa]` =
//! 238, name slot `0xbe1550` ← `"CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM"`), whose yellow is the **engine's** own
//! (`.rdata 0x8049ae` = `ff ff 00`), not a FrameXML `ChatTypeInfo` colour. The incoming events
//! `CHAT_MSG_AFK`/`DND` (249/250) are a different thing entirely — those are *other* players'
//! auto-replies, and never these.
