//! `WOW_FX_CENSUS=1` — where this frame's particle draws are actually addressed, and whether the
//! view they name is switched on.
//!
//! Built to answer "the login screen's braziers are simulating but nothing is on screen." A draw
//! record names the **main-world camera entity** whose view it belongs to
//! ([`super::buffer::EffectDraw::cam`]), and `particles::sim` resolves that for a booth-layered
//! emitter by finding the first booth camera whose `RenderLayers` intersect the emitter's. If two
//! booths share a layer, the wrong camera can win — and if that camera is inactive, the emitter
//! simulates forever and never draws. Nothing about that is visible in a frame time, a trace, or
//! the emitter's own state: the particles are all *correct*, just addressed to a view nobody is
//! rendering. The census makes it a line of output (decision 0775).
//!
//! Prints every 2 s: frames, live vertex count, how many DISTINCT vertex-buffer states were seen
//! (the liveness check — a frozen sim repeats one state), and the per-camera draw histogram with
//! each camera's booth token and active flag.
