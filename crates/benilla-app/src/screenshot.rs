//! **Print screen** (decision 1487) — the capture key, the writer, and the "Screen Captured" text
//! that must never appear in the file it announces.
//!
//! The reference's shape, which this reproduces exactly (its own `Bindings.xml` + `WorldFrame.lua`,
//! read off the 1.12.1 install):
//!
//! ```text
//! PRINTSCREEN → binding SCREENSHOT → TakeScreenshot()   [FrameXML]
//!                                      ScreenshotStatus:Hide()   ← last frame's text, gone first
//!                                      Screenshot()              [engine]
//!                                    … the frame is captured …
//! engine → SCREENSHOT_SUCCEEDED / SCREENSHOT_FAILED   → ScreenshotStatus shows, fades over 1.5 s
//! ```
//!
//! **That ordering is most of the answer to B261's third clause, and the rest is ours to arrange.**
//! For a single press nothing can leak: `Screenshot()` returns nothing and the outcome comes back
//! as an *event*, frames later, because the readback is asynchronous — the confirmation does not
//! exist yet when the shutter fires. The leak is the SECOND press inside the 1.5 s fade, when the
//! previous shot's "Screen Captured" is still on screen; that is what the reference's `Hide()`
//! before the capture is for.
//!
//! **And on our pipeline that `Hide()` lands one frame too late** — measured, not reasoned:
//! a live double press wrote the text straight into the second PNG. `ui_script`'s `drive_script`
//! ticks the VM and builds this frame's UI quad list at the TOP of the `UiInput` set; the binding
//! dispatch that runs `TakeScreenshot()` sits at the BOTTOM of that same set. So by the time the
//! binding hides the frame, the quads carrying its text are already built, and the frame that then
//! renders — and gets captured — still has the line in it. Nothing in the reference's design says
//! otherwise; the real client simply does not build its draw list in that order.
//!
//! So [`ask_for_captures`] **holds each ask for one frame** ([`ScreenshotState::pending`]). The
//! capture is requested on the frame AFTER the press, whose `drive_script` has rebuilt the quads
//! with the frame hidden. One frame is the whole fix and also the minimum: any less and the stale
//! quads are what gets photographed, any more and the shutter drifts from the keypress for no
//! reason. `ui_script::screenshot_tests` pins the UI contract; this file's own test pins the
//! deferral, and the live falsifier is a double press 0.6 s apart (decision 1487).
//!
//! **Two deliberate divergences, both recorded in 1487:**
//!
//! 1 · **PNG, where the reference writes TGA.** An uncompressed 32-bit Targa of a modern window is
//!     ~8 MB and no ordinary tool on a 2026 desktop previews one. This is the "mandatory unfaithful
//!     change" the report came in with; the mechanism, the folder and the naming are otherwise the
//!     reference's.
//! 2 · **`benilla-config/Screenshots/`, not `<install>/Screenshots/`** — decision 1486's rule:
//!     benilla reads a WoW install and never writes to one. Same folder name, different parent.
//!
//! **One reference behaviour deliberately NOT transcribed.** The real client fires
//! `SCREENSHOT_SUCCEEDED` whether or not the file was written — it discards the writer's return
//! value, so the event means "the device gave us a buffer" — and it has already deleted the
//! partial file. That is a bug, not a contract: [`report_captures`] answers `SCREENSHOT_FAILED`
//! when the encode or the write actually failed, and puts the reason in the log.
//!
//! **Two gaps that ARE faithful**, named so they are not mistaken for oversights: a raw
//! `Screenshot()` from a macro or addon skips `TakeScreenshot`'s `Hide()` and so can photograph a
//! fading confirmation (the reference's hide is in Lua too, and inventing an engine-side one would
//! be inventing behaviour); and the key does nothing at the glue screens, where the reference
//! captures through hard-coded, unrebindable `OnKeyDown` handlers that print nothing — a separate
//! slice, in the glue arc.
//!
//! Nothing here is dev-gated: this is a player feature, and it links in the `--no-default-features`
//! player build like the rest of the UI arc.
