//! The item-text reader session (`ItemTextFrame.xml`) — the one window every *readable* opens in:
//! a bag letter, a book in your bags, and a book/plaque lying in the world.
//!
//! **One reader, keyed on an object guid, opened locally with no permission packet.** That is the
//! reference's own shape, byte-verified (decision 1105): every route ends at `0x4e32e0(guid, flag)`,
//! which looks the guid up with typemask `1` (*any* object — item or GameObject), asks the object
//! for its page id through the shared `vtbl+0x74` getter, and pulls the text out of a cache. Which
//! of the two text sources applies is the object's own answer, not the caller's:
//!
//! - **a letter** — an item *instance* carrying `ITEM_FIELD_ITEM_TEXT_ID` (a mail-made permanent
//!   copy). One body, no pages; it rides the ask-once `CMSG_ITEM_TEXT_QUERY` cache mail letters use
//!   ([`crate::ui_mail::MailOpen::bodies`] — that map is the client's item-text cache, mail is just
//!   its first tenant), and its creator line resolves `ITEM_FIELD_CREATOR` through the name cache.
//! - **a page chain** — a readable item *template*'s `PageText`, or a `GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_TEXT` world
//!   object's template `data[0]`. Pages chain by `nextPageId` over the ask-once
//!   [`PageTexts`] cache (`CMSG_PAGE_TEXT_QUERY`), and the reader's prev/next buttons walk them.
//!   Authorless — a book has no `From,` tail.
//!
//! The routes in: `ui_items::drain::drain_container_uses` (the bag click's dispatcher arms #5 and
//! #6) and `target::click::act_on_right_click` (the world right-click's GO type-9 arm). None of
//! them sends a use/read packet — vmangos has no `GameObject::Use` case for type 9 at all, and its
//! `CMSG_READ_ITEM` handler gates on a template `PageText` the Plain Letter doesn't have, so both
//! would be answered with silence even if we asked.
//!
//! The feed mirrors the reference event flow (ItemTextFrame.lua l.10-96): open →
//! `ITEM_TEXT_BEGIN` (title known), everything fetched → `ITEM_TEXT_READY`, `CloseItemText()` →
//! session cleared + `ITEM_TEXT_CLOSED`. `ITEM_TEXT_TRANSLATION` (the foreign-language progress
//! bar) never fires — no translation mechanic on a private server's readables, and the `language`
//! column (`data[1]`/`LanguageID`) is carried by neither source here.
