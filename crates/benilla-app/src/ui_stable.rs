//! The app-side **stable feed** (decision 1676) — `PetStableFrame`'s data, the inward half of the
//! stable seam around [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `stable` module, and the twin of
//! [`crate::ui_trainer`]'s trainer feed.
//!
//! The net bridge fills [`StableOpen`] from the wire (`MSG_LIST_STABLED_PETS`, which the server
//! sends unprompted when the gossip stable option is chosen — the trainer's and the vendor's
//! arrangement exactly). Each frame [`feed_stable`] resolves each wire [`StabledPet`] into a
//! Lua-facing [`StablePetSlot`], pushes the snapshot, and fires `PET_STABLE_SHOW` on open /
//! `PET_STABLE_UPDATE` on a content change / `PET_STABLE_CLOSED` on clear. [`drain_stable`] pulls
//! the intents back out into the four wire verbs.
//!
//! ## The resolve, and the one round trip it needs
//!
//! The wire names a `creature_template` **entry** and a loyalty **level**; the window wants an
//! icon, a family word, a loyalty name and a diet. Three of those come from tables already loaded
//! for the live pet ([`PetFamilyTables`], [`PetStatTables`] — decisions 1062/1005); the fourth,
//! the family *id*, is not on the wire at all and must come from the creature query
//! ([`NameCache::resolve_creature`], ask-once).
//!
//! **So a stabled pet's row fills in two steps**, and that is not a defect to paper over: the name
//! and level render immediately off the wire, and the icon/family/diet appear when the template
//! answer lands a frame or two later. The feed diffs, so the arrival re-pushes and fires
//! `PET_STABLE_UPDATE` on its own. The reference has the same two-step (its own template cache
//! misses the first time too); what it does not have is our *empty* first step, because
//! `creaturecache.wdb` persists across sessions and ours does not yet.
//!
//! ## Why the current pet's row is read from the wire, not from the live pet
//!
//! Slot 0 can be occupied while `UnitExists("pet")` is false — a dismissed pet, or one left too far
//! away to be summoned, still gets a row from the server's character-pet cache. The reference
//! prefers the live unit and falls back to `GetStablePetInfo(0)` (`PetStable.lua:120-146`), so both
//! sources must be right; this feed fills the wire half for every row uniformly and lets the Lua
//! choose, rather than special-casing slot 0 into a live-unit read that would be blank for exactly
//! the hunter who needs the window most.
