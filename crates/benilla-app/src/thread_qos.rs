//! macOS thread QoS: keep frame-critical threads on the P-cores under system load.
//!
//! Apple Silicon schedules by QoS class, not fairness: a default-QoS thread queues behind any
//! higher class for P-core time. The main thread is user-interactive out of the box (verified by
//! probe — even bare `cargo run`, no bundle), but every worker Bevy spawns — compute pool, IO
//! pool, the pipelined-rendering thread — starts at default, the same class as `rustc` or an OBS
//! encoder. Under a background build the frame's own workers wait in the compiler's queue and the
//! client drops to 20 fps while the retail client (whose workers are promoted, plus Game Mode)
//! holds steady. Promoting the workers is the per-thread half of that story; the Game Mode half
//! needs an app bundle and is release-track (decision 0609).
//!
//! `pthread_set_qos_class_self_np` is not bound by the `libc` crate, so the extern lives here.
//! Everything is a no-op off macOS.
