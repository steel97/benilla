//! The 1.12 glue string table, read off the MPQ chain at startup — the localized text the glue
//! screens quote: faction/race/class description paragraphs (`FACTION_INFO_*`, `RACE_INFO_*`,
//! `ABILITY_INFO_*`, `CLASS_*`), the per-race customization dial labels (`HAIR_<tok>_STYLE`,
//! `FACIAL_HAIR_<tok>`), the login refusals, and the button captions.
//!
//! **It is two files, in the reference's own order** (decision 2052). `GlueXML.toc` sources
//! `GlueStrings.lua` at line 1 and `GlueLocalization.xml` at line 3, and that XML exists only to
//! load its script and call `Localize()` — a function of nothing but assignments, which *overwrite*
//! the base table. In 1.12 enGB it rewrites 32 keys, among them every long login refusal
//! (`AUTH_BANNED`, `LOGIN_UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT`, …) and the realm-type suffixes. Reading only the base
//! file showed the player sentences their own client never shows. The in-game side already loads
//! its exact twin — `Interface\FrameXML\Localization.xml`, same two-part shape, sourced from
//! `benilla.toc` — so the glue side was the half that had been left behind.
//!
//! Runtime-read, never embedded: the paragraphs are Blizzard content, so they load from the
//! player's own client data like every other asset (the repo's never-commit rule) — which is also
//! what makes the locale *theirs* rather than ours to guess. Both files are plain `KEY = "value";`
//! Lua assignments, one per line — a full Lua VM would be theater here; [`parse_glue_strings`]
//! handles exactly that shape (and skips everything else).
