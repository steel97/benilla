//! **`WOW_GPU_MS=1` — the whole-frame GPU meter** (1389's scoped follow-on, built 2026-08-18;
//! the drastic-options census' unknown #2 was "GPU frame time and VRAM headroom — no instrument
//! exists").
//!
//! Two plain render-graph nodes bracket the camera driver — `begin` writes timestamp 0 into a
//! two-slot query set from its command encoder, `end` writes timestamp 1 — legal on this machine
//! because we hold `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_ENCODERS` (Apple Silicon samples at stage boundaries;
//! bevy's own `RenderDiagnosticsPlugin` needs INSIDE_PASSES and reads zero GPU spans here — the
//! `perf` module header's ⚠ note, measured in 1389).
//!
//! **The resolve rides the NEXT frame's command buffer, ahead of that frame's own stamps.**
//! 1389's recorded trap: resolving the query set in the SAME command buffer as the timed work
//! returns zeros on Metal (5 of 6 reads; the 6th a plausible-looking near-miss) — resolve on a
//! later submission. The first build of this meter did that with a submission of its own: a
//! fresh encoder, a second `queue.submit` and an explicit `device.poll` in `Cleanup`, every
//! frame — a per-frame poll that traced at 1.8 ms on Intel's DX12 driver (2236) and priced
//! untraced in 2254. So the query set holds TWO stamp pairs and the frames alternate between
//! them ([`pairs`]): the `begin` node first resolves the pair the previous frame wrote — a later
//! submission, 1389's rule kept — and copies it into a free slot of a small ring of MAP_READ
//! buffers, on the graph's own shared encoder; then it writes this frame's pair. `Cleanup` only
//! kicks the map on the slot the graph just filled, and that map lands inside the NEXT frame's
//! own `queue.submit`, which runs wgpu's device maintenance as part of every submit
//! (`wgpu_core::device::queue::Queue::submit` ends in `Device::maintain(Poll)`) — the shape of
//! bevy's own `DiagnosticsRecorder`, and no submission or poll of the meter's own. The
//! published number is the freshest mapped delta, nanoseconds in one `AtomicU64` shared with
//! the main world — `FPS_PROBE` samples it per frame under the same env and prints its own
//! percentiles, so a leg gets `gpu_p50/gpu_p99` beside `cpu_ms` with zero cost when the env is
//! off (nothing registers).
