//! The FRAME-PHASE breakdown (`WOW_FRAME_PHASES=<ms>`) — *which phase* of a slow frame spent it.
//!
//! The instruments we had bracket this question from both sides and answer neither half of it.
//! `WOW_STREAM_TRACE` says a frame cost 411 ms and how many tiles/meshes/pipelines it touched;
//! the stall sampler (0713) shells `/usr/bin/sample` at a *600 ms* main-thread stall and hands
//! back a stack. Between them sits the whole class this project actually reports — the
//! 40–500 ms world-entry and teleport hitches (0962, 1116, 1345) — where the diagnosis has each
//! time been *"guess the suspect, then time it by hand"*. 1345 named that cost outright: the
//! FrameXML burst was found by reading a log's wall-clock stamps and subtracting.
//!
//! So: stamp the frame at boundaries that are **exact by construction**, and print the
//! breakdown for any frame over the threshold.
//!
//! - **Between the main schedules** the stamps are their own *marker schedules*, spliced into
//!   [`bevy::app::MainScheduleOrder`]. A schedule boundary is a hard sync point, so the stamp is
//!   the boundary — no ordering constraint to get wrong, no executor freedom to float in.
//! - **Inside `Update`** the stamps ride the four [`WorldStage`] sets the frame contract already
//!   defines (0737's Net → Input → Stream → Present chain), as **exclusive** systems so each one
//!   is a sync point too. That is a real perturbation of `Update`'s parallelism — which is why it
//!   is opt-in, and why the printed line carries `total=` measured across the whole frame rather
//!   than summed from the parts.
//!
//! **The residue is the point, not an afterthought.** A frame is `Main` *plus* the render
//! sub-app — extract, prepare, queue, render, present — and on macOS every first-sight pipeline
//! variant is compiled with `block_on` **inline on the render thread** (`pipe_warm`'s header),
//! which is invisible to every stamp inside `Main`. So the total is measured frame-start to
//! frame-start and the unaccounted remainder is printed as its own span, `render+present`. The
//! first cut of this instrument closed the tape at the end of `Last` and silently reported a
//! 506 ms frame as fitting inside 20 ms of `Main`.
//!
//! One line per slow frame, spans in the order they closed:
//!
//! ```text
//! [phase] frame 1972 total=60.5ms  First=0.2 PreUpdate=1.1 StateTransition=8.9 … render+present=31.2
//! ```
//!
//! Off unless `WOW_FRAME_PHASES` is set; `WOW_FRAME_PHASES=0` prints every frame.
