//! The stuck-main-thread self-sampler (`WOW_STALL_SAMPLE=0` to disable; macOS only): a watchdog
//! thread notices the main-thread heartbeat has gone stale and shells the stock profiler
//! (`/usr/bin/sample`) at our own PID, so an intermittent stall or teardown hang **diagnoses
//! itself the next time it happens** — on anyone's run, no reproduction needed. Two bugs that
//! each lost their reproduction motivated it (decision 0713): the ~1 s silent frame stalls at
//! the BWL pin, and the on-close beachball the director had to force-quit — where even the probe
//! backstop's `process::exit(0)` can wedge, because libc `exit(3)` runs the same atexit teardown
//! the hang may own. Samples land in `benilla-config/Diagnostics/` and the path prints on stderr
//! (the tracing subscriber may already be gone during teardown).
//!
//! After a teardown sample, an [`EXIT_KILL_MS`] backstop `_exit` ends the wedged process —
//! diagnosis first, then the force-quit the director would otherwise perform by hand.
//! `libc::_exit`, never `process::exit`: it skips the atexit handlers. It exits with the code
//! [`AppExit`] asked for, not a blanket 0 — a capture that already failed its own deadline must
//! not be laundered into a success by the thing that unwedges it.
//!
//! **The backstop is not a diagnostic, and it runs where the samples cannot.** A hermetic capture
//! run has no `benilla-config/` to write into ([`crate::local_state::home`] returns `None` under
//! `$WOW_CAPTURE`), and for one day in 1631 that turned the whole plugin off for exactly the runs
//! that most need a liveness guarantee — an agent-driven run with nobody watching it. So the split
//! is by concern, not by run: the watchdog thread and its `_exit` always run; the sample *file* is
//! written only where there is a folder that may hold one. Decision 1637.
//!
//! Verification is end-to-end via two injectors (used by the 0713 probe rounds, kept as standing
//! test affordances): `WOW_STALL_INJECT=<at_secs>:<ms>` sleeps the main thread mid-run, and
//! `WOW_TEARDOWN_INJECT=<ms>` wedges World drop via a resource whose `Drop` sleeps — the
//! director's beachball, synthetically.
