//! `perf` — performance instrumentation + the standing dev HUD ([`PerfPlugin`]).
//!
//! Owns the **frame-cost measurement layer** that every future subsystem is measured against (the
//! standard), and draws the always-on pill (top-center) that you **click to expand** into the full
//! readout; the **dev chord + `P`** toggles the whole HUD (`Ctrl+Shift+P` — decisions
//! 0585/0867/0870).
//!
//! The concerns, one file each:
//! - [`clock`] — the three CPU clocks (process, main thread, machine) every number is denominated in,
//! - [`stats`] — the rolling windows, their tails, and the spike latch,
//! - [`hud`] — the collapsed cost pill and the expanded readout,
//! - [`trace`] / [`journal`] — the two CSV instruments (`WOW_STREAM_TRACE`, `WOW_FPS_JOURNAL`),
//! - [`stall`] — the stuck-main-thread self-sampler (macOS),
//! - [`census`] — the env-gated premise counters.
//!
//! **The law the whole surface obeys (0717): while synced, wall frame time measures the display's
//! present grant, not our cost.** Only the CPU series measure work. That is why the pill's headline
//! is `cpu ms` and not fps — on a 120 Hz-adaptive panel, cost can double with the granted interval
//! unchanged and framerate unmoved, and the pill's old red threshold (fps < 58) sat ~5.7× above a
//! healthy frame. fps is still there, dimmed, as the familiar anchor.
//!
//! The budget is a **60 fps floor = 16.7 ms; no frame should exceed it** — but note that the
//! *missed-interval* threshold is derived from the interval we actually observe, not from this
//! constant (see [`stats::DROPPED_FACTOR`]). Deep per-system attribution is via Tracy
//! (`cargo run --features tracy`) — the `info_span!` markers on the hot systems feed it.
//!
//! ⚠️ **macOS/Metal — GPU timing.** We have `Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY` on this machine, but
//! **`TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES` is `false`**: Apple GPUs sample counters only at stage
//! boundaries (`MTLCounterSamplingPoint::AtStageBoundary`). Bevy's `RenderDiagnosticsPlugin` writes
//! its timestamps *inside* passes, so on Apple Silicon every span falls through to the CPU-only
//! branch and the store carries **zero** `elapsed_gpu` paths — verified on a live run: 14 diagnostic
//! paths, all `elapsed_cpu`. (bevy_render's own "Vulkan and DX12 only" comment is stale as a
//! statement about the *platform* — an Intel Mac would report `INSIDE_PASSES` and emit GPU spans.)
//! Pass-boundary `timestamp_writes` **does** work here and is the route to real GPU-ms — measured
//! 0.015/0.019/0.049 ms across 256²/1920×1080/4096² clears, 12/12 reproducible. It needs two
//! sentinel render-graph nodes at ~0.03 ms/frame, and the query set must be resolved in a
//! *different* command buffer than the timed pass or Metal returns zeros. Until that is built, a
//! GPU-bound frame is identified rather than timed: it is the one that runs long while both CPU
//! meters stay flat ([`stats::SpikeKind::Stalled`]).
