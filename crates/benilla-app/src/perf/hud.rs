//! The standing dev HUD: the cost pill, and nothing else.
//!
//! **The pill is two small numbers** (1448 pared it back; 1454 made it the whole HUD; 1455
//! dropped the spike arrow). fps dim — the familiar anchor, and by construction the number that
//! cannot see cost (0717) — then process-CPU cost per frame, the meter vsync cannot rail; both
//! under-size, because the pill sits over the game all session. Anything deeper is an
//! instrument's job, not a panel's: the journal (`WOW_FPS_JOURNAL`), the probes, Tracy, the
//! `frame hitch` log line and the stall self-sampler. The expanded egui readout that used to
//! live behind a click is gone (1454) — it duplicated the instruments at a standing cost — and
//! the spike-latch arrow went the same way (1455, the director's call).
//!
//! **Drawn from a 4 Hz snapshot, not the live meters.** The pill renders from [`PerfHud::snap`];
//! the meters keep sampling every frame — only the *view* is quantized, and 250 ms is inside a
//! human read of a number.
//!
//! **The pill does not touch egui at all** (1453). Drawing anything through egui wakes the whole
//! lane — bevy_egui's per-frame pipeline plus a full-screen compositing camera — which the
//! director's live toggle priced at ~1 ms for a 20-glyph pill. So [`pill_quads`] lays the pill
//! onto the player-UI quad pass, whose append lane is rebuilt every frame anyway; since 1454 the
//! HUD has no egui surface left and [`crate::debug_panel`]'s 1445 gate no longer consults it.
//!
//! **The HUD does not own settings.** It briefly carried a VSync checkbox and an MSAA readout;
//! VSync is a player video option now ([`crate::video`], the Graphics page's `gxVSync` row) and
//! MSAA is a startup knob (`$WOW_MSAA`). An instrument reports — it does not double as the control
//! panel, and this one is `#[cfg(feature = "dev")]`, so anything a player must reach cannot live
//! here at all. The measurement knob the checkbox actually existed for is `$WOW_NOVSYNC=1`.
