//! The standing dev HUD: a collapsed cost pill you can read while playing, and the full readout
//! behind a click.
//!
//! **The collapsed pill covers three timescales, because a regression can arrive on any of them.**
//! *Now* is the cost number. *The last few seconds* is the latched spike badge — a burst is ~250 ms
//! (0610) and the director is looking at the game when it happens, so the evidence has to outlive
//! the event. *The last minute* is the sparkline, which is the only lane that can see cost merely
//! sitting higher than it used to.
//!
//! **What is deliberately no longer the headline: fps.** 0717 established that while synced, wall
//! frame time measures the display's present grant rather than our cost — but it only ever applied
//! that to the expanded lines, and the pill went on reading framerate. On a 120 Hz-adaptive panel
//! that hides a doubling: cost can go 3 → 6 ms with the grant unchanged and the number unmoved, and
//! the old red threshold (fps < 58) sat ~5.7× above a healthy frame's cost. fps stays on the pill,
//! dimmed, as the familiar anchor it is — not as the thing being watched.
//!
//! **Detail lives behind the click, and nowhere else.** The pill briefly carried a hover tooltip
//! holding the whole readout, on the theory that hovering costs no screen — but the pill is
//! top-center, the mouse crosses it constantly, and a panel-sized popup over the game is worse than
//! the panel it was avoiding. One surface, opened deliberately.
//!
//! **The HUD does not own settings.** It briefly carried a VSync checkbox and an MSAA readout;
//! VSync is a player video option now ([`crate::video`], the Graphics page's `gxVSync` row) and
//! MSAA is a startup knob (`$WOW_MSAA`). An instrument reports — it does not double as the control
//! panel, and this one is `#[cfg(feature = "dev")]`, so anything a player must reach cannot live
//! here at all. The measurement knob the checkbox actually existed for is `$WOW_NOVSYNC=1`.

/// It is a *measured* string rather than a pixel constant so the panel stays correct at any font

/// whenever no spike badge is up.

/// **Why a governed width at all, twice over.** First, the numbers change width as they change
/// value (`8.55` → `11.73`), so an auto-sized panel jitters under your eye while you read it.
/// Second — and this is what actually shipped broken — auto-sizing here does not merely wobble, it
/// blows up:
///
/// - [`crate::debug_panel::overlay_text`] sets `TextWrapMode::Extend`, so **every label allocates
///   its full natural width and ignores `max_rect` entirely.** One long line (`SpikeKind::describe`
///   is ~110 characters) therefore *defines* the window width, and `set_width` alone cannot stop it.
/// - `Area` runs its sizing pass only on the frame the area is *created*
///   (`sizing_pass = state.is_none()`, egui 0.33 `containers/area.rs`). This HUD is born collapsed,
///   so that pass measures the pill; every later expand has no sizing pass, and `Separator` falls
///   through to `available_size_before_wrap()` — the room it *could* take.
///
/// Together those are the ragged panel the director reported: prose setting the width, separators
