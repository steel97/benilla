//! The FPS JOURNAL — `/console fpsJournal 1` in any build, or `WOW_FPS_JOURNAL=<csv path>` on a
//! harness run: once a second, append one row of where the player is, what the frame cost on
//! the wall, on the CPU and on the GPU, and **what is resident** (see [`JOURNAL_HEADER`] for the
//! column order, written into every fresh file) — the "where does it dip" instrument for a
//! director-driven run, and since decision 2008 the instrument a PLAYER on hardware we do not
//! own can run for us. They play normally; the journal turns "it drops in the Dwarven District"
//! into coordinates a headless probe can tele straight back to, and its GPU columns turn a Steam
//! Deck's "GPU 94 % busy" into which pass is eating it. Negligible cost: one line of IO a second,
//! samples reused from the frame meters.
//!
//! **Player-facing, so it lives outside the `dev` seam** (2008, on 1495's precedent): the people
//! whose frames we need to read run the player build, which compiles every other instrument out
//! (1173). The CVar's knob is [`FpsJournalSetting`]; the file is
//! `benilla-config/Diagnostics/fps-journal.csv` ([`crate::local_state::fps_journal_path`]), the
//! thing a reporter attaches. `WOW_FPS_JOURNAL` names another path and turns the journal on for
//! the run regardless of the CVar — the harness lever it always was. A fresh file opens with one
//! `#` line naming the adapter, the backend and whether the device can time passes, so a journal
//! from a machine we have never seen says what it was read on.
//!
//! **The GPU columns read bevy's render diagnostics** (`RenderDiagnosticsPlugin`, registered here
//! so it is present in every build): one timestamp pair per render pass, resolved a few frames
//! later into `render/<pass>/elapsed_gpu` measurements. Those exist where the device offers
//! `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES` — Vulkan and DX12, so the Linux and Windows builds — and never
//! on an Apple GPU, which samples counters only at stage boundaries (the `perf` module header);
//! there the columns stay EMPTY rather than zero, so "no reading" cannot be mistaken for "free".
//! Our own passes (`static_gx`, the `ffx_glow` chain, `ui_gamma_decode`) open spans of their own,
//! because a city's biggest draw must not land in `gpu_other`. The buckets are [`gpu_bucket`]; a
//! pass this file does not name is still counted, under `gpu_other`, and `gpu_ms` is the sum of
//! every pass — the GPU's busy time inside passes, which is what "GPU-bound" reads against the
//! wall `mean_ms` beside it.
//!
//! The residency columns make it the **leak curve** instrument too (B131): `FPS_PROBE`'s residency
//! meter samples once per run, which can only compare two runs at one point each — it cannot tell
//! "grows with distance streamed" from "grows with time elapsed", and cannot show *where* on a
//! route the cost arrives. A per-second row of `cpu_ms` beside `mats/images/uv/tint` plots the
//! per-frame cost directly against residency along one continuous leg, on the same time axis as
//! the position — so a same-map traverse (no `MapChange`, so no map-scoped eviction) shows its
//! accumulation as a slope instead of a before/after pair.
