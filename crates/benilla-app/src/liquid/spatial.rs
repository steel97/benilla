//! The liquid **spatial index** — which surfaces are over an XY, without walking them all.
//!
//! [`super::surfaces_at`] answers "what liquid is at this XY" by testing every loaded
//! [`WaterChunkInfo`] in turn. That is fine for the consumers that ask once or twice a frame
//! (the camera waterline, the submersion verdict, a footstep) — and it detonates the moment a
//! consumer asks per *draw*: the water-plane interleave's mesh lane (0919) classified ~13k
//! transparent batches against ~2.2k loaded surfaces every frame — 29 M box tests, 54 ms, the
//! 2026-08-03 "60 → 12 fps" regression, measured at the Stormwind pin by the live FPS probe.
//!
//! The index is a plain XY grid hash: one bucket per [`CELL`]-sized cell, each holding every
//! surface whose wet-footprint box overlaps that cell. A point query is one hash lookup, and the
//! hot path re-uses the exact same predicates ([`WaterChunkInfo::contains`] et al.) on the
//! handful of candidates it returns — the verdict set is identical to the full walk by
//! construction, because a surface is registered in every cell its box overlaps.
//!
//! Membership only changes when surfaces stream in or out with their tiles, so the rebuild is
//! edge-triggered (`Added` / `RemovedComponents`) and costs nothing on a steady frame. A stale
//! entry between despawn and rebuild self-filters at the consumer (`Query::get` on a dead entity
//! misses), and a surface spawned this frame is indexed before the next frame's consumers run.
