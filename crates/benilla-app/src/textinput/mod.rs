//! **The one text-input law, host half.** Every text field in the client — the FrameXML EditBoxes
//! (chat, `/who`, the StaticPopup) and the three glue-screen fields (login account/password, the
//! character name, the delete confirmation) — resolves its keystrokes here.
//!
//! There are three parts, and the split is deliberate:
//!
//! - [`keymap`] — *which chord means what*, per OS. The one place Ctrl+V vs Cmd+V is decided
//!   (decision 0301).
//! - [`clipboard`] — *the OS pasteboard*, one held handle per process, per-platform backend
//!   (decision 0702).
//! - [`feed_key`] (here) — the glue between them and the **engine's** byte-verified box law
//!   ([`EditBoxState`], decision 0704). It owns no editing semantics of its own.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists
//!
//! The editing law was reachable only through the Lua UI runtime, so the glue screens — which have
//! no Lua VM — each hand-rolled a three-case imitation: append a printable char, Backspace, Tab.
//! No caret movement, no selection, no Ctrl+A, and no clipboard at all. Worse, they matched on
//! winit's `logical_key`, which is `Character("v")` for Ctrl+V, so **pasting into the login box
//! typed a literal `v` into the password**. Four fields, four different laws, three of them wrong.
//!
//! Now the law is [`EditBoxState`]'s (pure, no Lua — decision 0704) and the *routing* is this
//! module's, so a field gets the whole thing by owning an `EditBoxState` and calling [`feed_key`].
//! The FrameXML path keeps its own dispatcher because it must also fire Lua handlers and route
//! focus through the widget arena, but it reads the same [`keymap`] and the same [`clipboard`].
