//! **TOGGLEUI** — the hide-the-interface binding (`ALT-Z`).
//!
//! The state ([`UiHidden`]) and the binding that flips it; the two things that *obey* it are the
//! quad pass's mesh rebuild (`ui_pass::rebuild_ui_mesh` draws nothing) and the UI's pointer feed
//! (`ui_script::input::feed_ui_input` stops hit-testing). Kept out of `ui_pass` deliberately: this
//! is a *game binding*, not part of the render substrate.

/// Is the player UI hidden right now? (`ALT-Z` — [`toggle_ui_hidden`].)
///
/// Hidden means *"draw nothing"*, not *"stop producing"*: the widget arena keeps ticking and both
/// quad lanes keep filling, so open panels, tooltip state, cooldown sweeps and chat scrollback are
/// exactly where they were the moment the UI comes back — only the pass's mesh batches go away.
/// **Everything that lands in `ui_pass::UiQuads` goes dark together**: the FrameXML layer, the
/// minimap, the V-plates, chat bubbles and floating combat text — the world and nothing else,
/// which is the point of the binding. What stays up: the dev overlays (their own camera and their
/// own dev chords — an instrument, not the player's UI), the glue/loading screens (Bevy UI
/// nodes, not quads), and the cursor.
///
/// The UI also stops taking the **mouse** while hidden: an invisible action bar must not eat a
/// click or arm a tooltip. The keyboard feed stays live — a hidden UI is still the client you're
/// playing, and `ENTER`/`ESCAPE`/the bar keys keep working exactly as the reference's do.
