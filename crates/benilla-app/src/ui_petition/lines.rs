//! The charter session's **system lines** — the messages the engine composes, and *which of the
//! client's two message channels each one goes to*.
//!
//! The split is the part a re-implementation cannot guess, and we did guess it wrong first: by the
//! key names, `ERR_PETITION_SIGNED_S` and `ERR_PETITION_ALREADY_SIGNED` look like the same kind of
//! thing. They are not. wow-re
//! `system/object-layer/scratch/petition-wire-law.md` §4 read the message catalog at `0xb4b498`
//! (stride `0x14`, field `+4` = kind, routed through the four-entry table at `0x496888`) and swept
//! every row:
//!
//! - the **four** `_S`/success ids `0x141`-`0x144` carry kind `0` → the shared chat chokepoint
//!   `0x49a870` with the row's own `+0x10` chat type, which is `0xa` → **`CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM`**, the
//!   same channel every `ERR_GUILD_*` line uses;
//! - the **five** refusals `0x145`-`0x149`, and `ERR_NO_GUILD_CHARTER` (`0x7c`), carry kind `2` →
//!   `UI_ERROR_MESSAGE` (`0xe0`), the **red UIErrorsFrame line**.
//!
//! That sweep is no longer this module's to carry: since decision 1770 the whole registry ships as
//! [`benilla_ui::messages`], and each line below asks it by key. The paragraphs above stay because
//! they record *why* the split is not guessable — the reason a lookup was worth building.
//!
//! Two more facts from the same sweep that shape the tables below:
//!
//! - **`PETITION_SIGN_NEED_MORE` (4) has no user-visible message on the SIGN path at all.** It
//!   falls into the default arm with `>= 6` and reaches only the debug console
//!   (`0x63cb50("Petition error")`). It *does* have one on the turn-in path. Same code, two
//!   packets, two behaviours.
//! - **A successful turn-in emits no text whatsoever** (`0x5ef166`). It fires
//!   `GUILD_REGISTRAR_CLOSED` and says nothing. This file first shipped an `ERR_GUILD_FOUNDER_S`
//!   line there, reasoned from the fact that vmangos never sends the guild-command result that
//!   would produce one; the binary settles it — founding a guild really is silent, and the player
//!   learns of it from the guild pane lighting up.
//!
//! Every one of these rows also carries a named sound cue (`+0xc = 0x44`): `0x142`/`0x143` play
//! `igPlayerInviteAccept` and `0x144`-`0x149` play `igPlayerInviteDecline`, while `0x141` has none.
//! Recorded here; wiring the cue is [`super`]'s job, not this module's.
