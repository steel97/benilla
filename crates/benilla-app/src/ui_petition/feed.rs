//! The charter VM feed/drain — the systems half of [`super`]: resolve the wire's guids and ids into
//! the snapshot the two charter windows read, fire the four events on their edges, drain the
//! composed lines onto their two channels, and turn the Lua-side [`PetitionRequest`] intents into
//! their sends.
//!
//! **`PETITION_SHOW` is DEFERRED, and that is the load-bearing behaviour of this file.** The real
//! client fires it only when *no signer name is still resolving* **and** *the petition record has
//! arrived* (`0x4f419b`-`0x4f41ad`), and it fires exactly once however many names were outstanding
//! (`0x4f4320` decrements the pending counter and fires only on the transition to zero). wow-re's
//! note puts it flatly: *"A client that fires `PETITION_SHOW` straight off the packet paints a
//! window with blank signer names."* That is precisely what this file did before the carve — it
//! opened immediately and repainted as each lookup landed, which is a visibly different window.
//!
//! Two things follow, and they are why the deferral is a simplification rather than a cost:
//!
//! - the window never paints a partial state, so `PetitionFrame`'s `format(GUILD_CHARTER_TEMPLATE,
//!   title)` can never see a nil title;
//! - the *getters* still answer honestly at any moment (an addon may call them whenever it likes),
//!   which is why `benilla_ui::script::petition` keeps its no-record leg and its nil names. The
//!   deferral is about the **event**, not about the data.
//!
//! **The owner's name is deliberately NOT part of the defer condition.** The pending counter is
//! incremented only for *signers* (`0x4f4186`/`0x4f42e8`), so a charter whose owner name has not
//! resolved still opens, with `GetPetitionInfo`'s fifth return reading nil. Folding the owner in
//! would look tidier and would hold the window shut in a case the client does not.
//!
//! **Lines go to two different channels**, and which one is not guessable from the key names — see
//! [`super::lines`]. The red `UI_ERROR_MESSAGE` needs the `script` handle, which is why they are
//! composed at apply time and fired here.
