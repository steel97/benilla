//! The guild-charter session — the registrar window, the petition window, and the verbs that found
//! a guild (decision 1672).
//!
//! [`crate::ui_guild`] is *being* in a guild; this is *making* one, the slice 1257 §2 deliberately
//! left out and named as the next. It mirrors the wire the way that module does: the seven server
//! packets replace or patch [`PetitionState`] / [`GuildRegistrarState`], and [`feed`] turns them
//! into the display-ready snapshot `benilla_ui::script::petition` reads.
//!
//! **Two windows, two sessions, and only one of them is an NPC session.**
//!
//! - [`GuildRegistrarState`] is the NPC half: it opens on `SMSG_PETITION_SHOWLIST` (which the
//!   server pushes when the "How do I form a guild?" gossip row is selected — vmangos
//!   `Player.cpp:12428-12431` closes the gossip menu and calls `SendPetitionShowList`), it knows a
//!   price and an NPC guid, and it closes when the player walks away like every other NPC window
//!   ([`crate::ui_session`]). wow-re corroborates the shape rather than merely permitting it: the
//!   function that fires `GUILD_REGISTRAR_SHOW` (`0x4f4fb0`, firing at `0x4f4fff`) is one of the
//!   fourteen callers of `CGGameUI::SetInteractNPC 0x4930d0`
//!   (`system/object-layer/scratch/interaction-facing.md:177-178`), which is the *same* latch every
//!   other NPC window arms.
//! - [`PetitionState`] is the item half: it opens on `SMSG_PETITION_SHOW_SIGNATURES`, is bound to a
//!   charter **item guid**, and has no NPC at all. Walking away from the registrar must not close
//!   it, which is why the two are separate resources rather than one with a half-meaning `close()`.
//!
//! They meet at exactly one place: `TurnInGuildCharter()` is a *registrar* button that acts on a
//! charter in the *bags*, found by [`crate::ui_items::find_item`].
//!
//! **The gossip handoff needs no special case, and that is worth saying because the banker's did**
//! (decision 0607). vmangos's `GOSSIP_OPTION_PETITIONER` arm calls `PlayerTalkClass->CloseGossip()`
//! *before* `SendPetitionShowList` (`Player.cpp:12428-12431`), and `CloseGossip` really does send
//! `SMSG_GOSSIP_COMPLETE` (`GossipDef.cpp:231-236`) — so the menu closes itself, and the registrar
//! takes the left panel slot the gossip window has already released. The bank needed
//! `npc::show_bank` to force that close precisely because its option sends no such packet; this one
//! must NOT, or the close would be done twice.
//!
//! **The laws that are not what the obvious design would do:**
//!
//! - **The window opens before it knows what it is showing.**
//!   `SMSG_PETITION_SHOW_SIGNATURES` carries an item guid, an owner guid, a petition id and a list
//!   of signer guids — and no text whatsoever. The proposed guild's name and the signature
//!   requirement come only from `SMSG_PETITION_QUERY_RESPONSE`, keyed by petition id, and the
//!   names come from [`crate::names::NameCache`]. So the petition window's first paint is
//!   deliberately partial and repaints as each lookup lands. This is the identical two-caches shape
//!   `SMSG_GUILD_ROSTER` has with `SMSG_GUILD_QUERY_RESPONSE` ([`crate::ui_guild`]'s own module
//!   doc), and the cache is lazy for the same reason: nothing queries a petition we are not looking
//!   at.
//! - **One inbound packet, two meanings.** `SMSG_PETITION_SHOW_SIGNATURES` answers our own
//!   `CMSG_PETITION_SHOW_SIGNATURES` *and* is what arrives when somebody offers us their charter
//!   (`Handlers/PetitionsHandler.cpp:390-397`). Nothing distinguishes them but whether `owner` is
//!   us — so there is no "an offer arrived" path separate from "a charter opened", and building one
//!   would be inventing a distinction the wire does not make.
//! - **A signature does not push a new list.** vmangos answers a successful sign with
//!   `SMSG_PETITION_SIGN_RESULTS` to both parties and **no fresh signatures packet**
//!   (`:299`, `:312-316`), while the reference's `PetitionFrame` registers only `PETITION_SHOW` and
//!   `PETITION_CLOSED`. Nothing would ever repaint the name rows. So an `OK` result naming the open
//!   charter re-sends `CMSG_PETITION_SHOW_SIGNATURES` ([`apply::sign_results`]) — INFERRED, and
//!   flagged as such below.
//! - **Two success paths are silent on the wire and speak locally.** Offering a charter answers the
//!   *target*, not us, and finding no charter to turn in is refused before any packet is built —
//!   so `ERR_PETITION_OFFERED_S` and `ERR_NO_GUILD_CHARTER` are composed here. Both strings exist
//!   in `GlobalStrings.lua` and nothing on the wire can produce either, which is the same test
//!   [`crate::ui_guild::lines`] uses to identify an engine-composed line.
//!
//! ## What is INFERRED, and what would settle it
//!
//! wow-re had **not carved a single one of this subsystem's contracts** when this landed — it holds
//! the eight binding addresses (`system/ui/scratch/bindings.md:455-462`, all classified
//! ORCHESTRATION: located, contract never derived) and the four event ids
//! (`guild-api-carve.md:603-624`), and nothing about the wire or the handlers. Every claim below is
//! read off the *demand* side (the shipped `PetitionFrame.lua` / `GuildRegistrarFrame.lua`) plus
//! vmangos, and is named here so none of it is mistaken for byte law:
//!
//! 1. **`SMSG_PETITION_SHOWLIST` → `GUILD_REGISTRAR_SHOW`** (no args). The firer `0x4f4fb0` sits in
//!    the petition band with `0x5eeb80` as its sole caller; the byte read of that handler settles
//!    it.
//! 2. **`SMSG_PETITION_SHOW_SIGNATURES` → `PETITION_SHOW`** (no args), everything painted from
//!    getters. The reference's own OnEvent uses no `arg1`, which makes this weak-but-consistent.
//! 3. **`ClosePetition()` / `CloseGuildRegistrar()` send nothing.** Chosen because inventing
//!    traffic 1.12 never sends is the worse failure, and because wow-re already recorded exactly
//!    that verdict for the neighbouring `CloseGuildRoster` (`xor eax,eax; ret`).
//! 4. **Re-requesting the signature list on an `OK` sign result** (above).
//! 5. **`ERR_GUILD_FOUNDER_S` on a successful turn-in.** vmangos declares `GUILD_FOUNDER_S = 0x0E`
//!    and **never sends it** — `Guild::Create` broadcasts no event at all on the founding path
//!    (`Guild/Guild.cpp:104-119`), so without a local line, founding a guild is completely silent.
//!    The string is routed through [`crate::ui_guild::lines`]'s existing constant so there is one
//!    copy; a server that *does* send the command result would double the line, which is visible
//!    and cheap to undo.
//! 6. **Using a charter item opens it** — see [`crate::ui_items::ItemUseRoute::ShowPetition`],
//!    where the evidence and its limits are written down.
