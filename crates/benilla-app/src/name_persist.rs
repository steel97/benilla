//! **The name cache, kept across sessions** (decision 1689) — the load/save half of
//! [`crate::names::NameCache`], and benilla's answer to the reference's `WDB/*.wdb` files.
//!
//! ## Why this exists at all
//!
//! Three of benilla's caches are filled by a server round trip: player names, creature templates
//! and pet names. **The reference persists exactly one of the three** — `creaturecache.wdb` — and
//! that is what this module keeps. `'WNAM'` and `'WPNM'` are constructed with persistence
//! **disabled** (`0x554cd0`'s three `push 0x0`, against `'WNPC'`/`'WIDB'`'s `push 0x1; push 0x1`)
//! and are cleared at world-session start instead; a real 1.12 install's `WDB/` holds
//! `creaturecache.wdb`, `npccache.wdb`, `itemcache.wdb` … and no `namecache.wdb`. 1689 read the
//! carve as "all three" and wrote player and pet names to disk too, which is what answered a wiped
//! server's brand-new character with a deleted one's name (B386); **decision 2223** took them back
//! out and put the wipe in ([`NameCache::clear_world_session`]).
//!
//! What survives is the half that carried the value anyway: a city's worth of creature-template
//! queries on zone-in, answered from disk instead of the wire. The **key** is the whole argument —
//! a template entry means the same creature on every realm forever, while a player guid means one
//! character and a pet number one live spawn.
//!
//! ## The law, from the carve
//!
//! wow-re carved the whole `DBCache.cpp` machine (`system/dbcache/dbcache.md`, T3 — all 12 record
//! decoders diffed bit-exact). Two of its contracts are the ones a re-implementation must honour,
//! and both are about what the cache does *not* do:
//!
//! - **The header is compared by equality, and carries no checksum, no timestamp and no TTL.** Its
//!   20 bytes are `[FourCC | build 0x16f3 | locale | recordSize | version 1]`. A mismatch discards
//!   the file wholesale. Ours is a header line with the same job ([`NameCache::to_tsv`]).
//! - **Eviction is explicit only** — a high-bit key in a response, or `SMSG_INVALIDATE_PLAYER`
//!   (`0x31C`). Nothing ages out. That is survivable for a record whose key cannot change meaning,
//!   which is precisely why the stores whose keys *can* are not persisted at all.
//!
//! ## Where it lives, and the one place we deviate
//!
//! The reference writes `WDB/` **inside the install**, which is precisely where benilla may not
//! write (the contract's read-only rule). Ours goes to `benilla-config/cache/<realm>.tsv` through
//! [`crate::local_state`], like every other thing we persist — and it is **realm-scoped**, which
//! the reference's is not. That is a fix rather than a preference: every key is realm-local (a
//! player guid, a creature entry, a pet number), so one shared file would serve another realm's
//! names to this one.
