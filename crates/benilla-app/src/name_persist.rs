//! **The name cache, kept across sessions** (decision 1689) — the load/save half of
//! [`crate::names::NameCache`], and benilla's answer to the reference's `WDB/*.wdb` files.
//!
//! ## Why this exists at all
//!
//! Three of benilla's caches are filled by a server round trip: player names, creature templates
//! and pet names. The reference persists all three (`namecache.wdb`, `creaturecache.wdb`,
//! `petnamecache.wdb`), so on a machine that has played before, an answer is usually *already
//! there* when the packet that needs it arrives. benilla asked fresh every login, which made a
//! race the reference has practically closed wide open for us — the director hit it as a Lua error
//! when unstabling a pet, where `PetStable_Update` hands a nil `UnitName("pet")` to a
//! `GameTooltip:SetText` whose signature requires a string (decision 1688 closed that one path by
//! seeding from the stable list; this closes the class).
//!
//! ## The law, from the carve
//!
//! wow-re carved the whole `DBCache.cpp` machine (`system/dbcache/dbcache.md`, T3 — all 12 record
//! decoders diffed bit-exact). Two of its contracts are the ones a re-implementation must honour,
//! and both are about what the cache does *not* do:
//!
//! - **The header is compared by equality, and carries no checksum, no timestamp and no TTL.** Its
//!   20 bytes are `[FourCC | build 0x16f3 | locale | recordSize | version 1]`. A mismatch discards
//!   the file wholesale. Ours is a header line with the same job ([`NameCache::to_tsv`]).
//! - **Eviction is explicit only** — a high-bit key in a response, or `SMSG_INVALIDATE_PLAYER`
//!   (`0x31C` → remove-by-key `0x556ff0`). Nothing ages out. So a persisted name lives until the
//!   server says otherwise, which is why that opcode had to be wired before anything was written
//!   to disk: in memory a stale name costs a session, on disk it costs forever.
//!
//! ## Where it lives, and the one place we deviate
//!
//! The reference writes `WDB/` **inside the install**, which is precisely where benilla may not
//! write (the contract's read-only rule). Ours goes to `benilla-config/cache/<realm>.tsv` through
//! [`crate::local_state`], like every other thing we persist — and it is **realm-scoped**, which
//! the reference's is not. That is a fix rather than a preference: every key is realm-local (a
//! player guid, a creature entry, a pet number), so one shared file would serve another realm's
//! names to this one.
