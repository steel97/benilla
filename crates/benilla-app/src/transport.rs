//! Transports (decision 0438) — the client-computed cycle, two drives, one subsystem.
//!
//! The server never streams a transport's position. It sends one **anchor** — the movement
//! block's `UPDATE_FLAG_TRANSPORT` u32, the server's path-progress ms clock at create — and the
//! client computes everything else, per GameObject type:
//!
//! - **Type 15 (`MO_TRANSPORT`, boats/zeppelins):** the whole timetable (per-leg Catmull-Rom
//!   splines + stop-to-stop trapezoid times, [`benilla_formats::TransportTimetable`]) from
//!   `TaxiPathNode.dbc` and the template's `(taxiPathId, moveSpeed, accelRate)` tuple; the boat
//!   sits at `timetable((anchor + local_elapsed) % period)` every frame.
//! - **Type 11 (`TRANSPORT`, elevators/lifts/trams — decision 0438 phase 3's second consumer):**
//!   the authored keyframe path from `TransportAnimation.dbc` keyed by the **template entry**;
//!   the car sits at `spawn + R(spawn_quat)·lerp(keyframes, (anchor + local_elapsed) % period)`
//!   ([`benilla_formats::elevator_sample`] — the client's `gameobject_path_eval`, byte-verified
//!   in wow-re; vmangos `ElevatorTransport::Update` is the same math server-side).
//!
//! Re-creates (map transitions, the server's mid-course "update frames") re-anchor the clock;
//! decision 0318's replace semantics make that free.
//!
//! The armed entity is the ordinary streamed GameObject — the display (WMO for boats, M2 for
//! elevator cars), its collider, and its `Transform` all pre-exist on the GO-entity path
//! (decision 0438 §2); this module only *moves* it. Riding hangs off the same component set for
//! both drives — the mover's platform frame keys on [`Transport`], not on the drive.
