//! The always-up world-state readout (`WorldStateFrame`) — the app half behind
//! `assets/ui/WorldStateFrame.xml` and benilla-ui's `script/worldstate.rs` bindings.
//!
//! This is report **B190**'s second half: the alliance↔horde progress UI. `WorldStateUI.dbc` says
//! which world states are *displayed*, where, and with what label; [`crate::world_state`] holds
//! what the server actually sent; this module joins them and pushes the result.
//!
//! Everything below is the reference's, carved 2026-08-25 (wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/worldstate-ui-law.md`).
//!
//! ## The list builder (`0x4c56e0`)
//!
//! Walks the whole DBC and admits a row on three gates, each failure skipping the row rather than
//! aborting the walk:
//!
//! 1. **Map** — `MapID == -1` (a wildcard with *zero* shipped rows) or `MapID` equals the scope's
//!    map;
//! 2. **Area** — `AreaID == 0` (wildcard) or equal to the scope's area;
//! 3. **Type** — `0` accepts unconditionally, `1` accepts only while [`defense_channel_joined`],
//!    `2` (the battleground scoreboard columns) always rejects.
//!
//! **The scope is the server's last `SMSG_INIT_WORLD_STATES`, not the player's position**
//! ([`crate::world_state::WorldStates::scope`]). That is not a simplification: the two globals it
//! mirrors have exactly two writers each image-wide, the init clear and the logout reset, so a
//! plain zone change moves nothing here. It matters — walk into Eastern Plaguelands and the readout
//! appears when the *server* says so, which is also when the states it would read arrive.
//!
//! ## Why the towers need a chat channel
//!
//! The `Type == 1` gate is the surprising one, and it is the whole of what the world-PvP rows
//! (Eastern Plaguelands' three, Silithus's two) hang on. The reference recomputes a flag by
//! scanning the channels the player has **joined** and asking whether any of their
//! `ChatChannels.dbc` rows carries **both** `ZONE_DEP` and `DEFENSE` — which in the shipped table
//! is row 22 alone, the zone-scoped defense channel. Leave that channel and the tower readout
//! disappears; the map icons, which are gated on the world states themselves, stay.
//!
//! ## The text (`0x508560`)
//!
//! Exactly one of the ten returned values is expanded, and by an expander that is **not** the
//! NPC-text one — different function, different grammar, sharing only the table getter. See
//! [`expand`].
