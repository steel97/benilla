//! The guild session's **system lines** — the `ERR_GUILD_*` messages the engine composes.
//!
//! Every guild event and every command verdict prints one line, and the *engine* composes it, not
//! the FrameXML: `SMSG_GUILD_EVENT`'s handler `0x5e7180` routes its arms into
//! `CGGameUI::DisplayError 0x496720`, and the invite / decline / command-result handlers do the
//! same (`0x5e6f65`, `0x5e6f9a`, `0x5e7520`). Not one of the `ERR_GUILD_*` keys those resolve to
//! appears anywhere in the reference FrameXML, which is what identifies them as engine-composed —
//! [`crate::ui_social`]'s own test, applied again.
//!
//! **These are message ids, not sentences** (decision 2054). Each arm names a catalog key and the
//! arguments the reference pushes beside it; the drain resolves the key against the player's own
//! `GlobalStrings.lua` and the catalog row decides the surface and the sound. That is not a
//! restatement of what was here before: this module used to carry 34 re-typed English constants and
//! its own two `fill` helpers, which threw away three things the catalog knows —
//! `ERR_GUILD_NAME_INVALID` and `ERR_GUILD_NAME_EXISTS_S` are `kind 2`, the **red** error line and
//! not chat at all; `ERR_GUILD_CREATE_S` and `ERR_INVITED_TO_GUILD_SS` carry the `LEVELUP` cue; and
//! `ERR_GUILD_PERMISSIONS` has `type_tag 0x3e`, under `VOCAL_UI_LINES`, so the reference *speaks* it
//! (decision 1815).
//!
//! **The `GUILD_MOTD` line is deliberately not here.** The reference's `ChatFrame_OnEvent` composes
//! `GUILD_MOTD_TEMPLATE` itself off the `GUILD_MOTD` event (`ChatFrame.lua:1335-1340`), so firing
//! the event is the whole job and composing a line beside it would double it.
//!
//! **`/ginfo` is not here either, and that is faithful.** Its two lines are `GUILD_NAME_TEMPLATE`
//! and `GUILD_INFO_TEMPLATE` — *not* catalog rows: `0x5e6fb0` resolves each token through the
//! script VM (`0x703bf0` at `0x5e700f`/`0x5e706b`), formats it, and emits chat directly, never
//! passing a message record. A route with no record has no `kind` and no sound to read, so it is
//! resolved where the VM is — [`super::feed`] — rather than queued as a message.
//!
//! The id → key mapping is **wow-re `system/ui/scratch/guild-api-carve.md` §5's own table**, §5
//! cross-checked with the case-arm bytes quoted per row (`0x5e720a`→0x59 … `0x5e745a`→0x69), and
//! the keys are matched against benilla's generated catalog rather than by name.
