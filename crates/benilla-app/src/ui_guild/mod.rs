//! The guild session — the identity cache, the roster, the ranks, and the outbound verbs
//! (decision 1257).
//!
//! [`GuildState`] mirrors the wire the way [`crate::ui_social`]'s `SocialState` does: the seven
//! server packets replace it or patch it, and the feed ([`feed`]) turns it into the display-ready
//! snapshot `benilla_ui::script::guild` reads. The laws below are the ones that are *not* what the
//! obvious design would do, each verified at the reference's bytes (wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/guild-api-carve.md`, `guild-roster-wire.md`, RF-0077):
//!
//! - **Identity and roster are two caches with two lifetimes.** `SMSG_GUILD_ROSTER` carries the
//!   MOTD, the info text, the rank *rights* and the members; it carries neither the guild's name
//!   nor the rank *names*. Those come only from `SMSG_GUILD_QUERY_RESPONSE`, keyed by guild id.
//!   [`GuildState::identities`] is that second cache, keyed by id precisely because
//!   `PLAYER_GUILDID` (191) is PUBLIC: every visible player's guild has to be nameable, not just
//!   ours ([`unit_guild`]).
//! - **That cache is LAZY, and nothing primes it.** No query goes out at world entry. The first
//!   read that needs an uncached guild fires `CMSG_GUILD_QUERY` **and answers empty for that
//!   call** — `GetGuildRosterInfo` does it inline (`0x4d1291`, returning its whole nil tuple on
//!   the miss) and the arrival fires `GUILD_ROSTER_UPDATE` with no args (`0x4d1480`). Ours is
//!   [`GuildState::resolve_identity`], shaped like [`crate::names::NameCache::resolve`], which is
//!   this house's existing name for that idiom.
//! - **An empty name in the query response is "no such guild"**, not a guild with a blank name —
//!   the reference tests exactly that (`0x5552ae test al,al`, choosing the cache *insert*
//!   `0x561070` or the cache *remove* `0x561390`). Cached as a negative so the query is not
//!   re-sent forever.
//! - **The roster is sorted, never filtered.** Show-offline changes the *count*
//!   ([`GuildState::num_members`]), never the array. See [`sort`], and see
//!   `benilla_ui::script::GuildState::num_members` for why collapsing the two is wrong.
//! - **Selection is a guid**, not a row: `SetGuildRosterSelection 0x4d1820` stores the member's
//!   guid (`0x4d186a`/`0x4d1872`) and `GetGuildRosterSelection 0x4d1890` linear-searches it back
//!   to a 1-based index, so a re-sort keeps the same *player* highlighted and a member who leaves
//!   silently becomes "nothing selected" — exactly the friend list's `+0x648` shape.
//! - **`GuildRoster()` is throttled to one request per 10 s** (`0x4d10d0` against `0xb73130`), and
//!   the one branch that sets `GUILD_ROSTER_UPDATE`'s arg1 clears that throttle first
//!   (`0x4d1160`). See [`RosterUpdate`]: the two halves are one mechanism, and implementing either
//!   without the other breaks it.
