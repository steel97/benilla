//! **The outline blit recipe** — the client's baked-outline architecture, byte-for-byte.
//!
//! An outlined font (`outline="NORMAL"/"THICK"`, the Number* fonts) does not draw a ring and a fill
//! as two things. The real client composites both into **one** atlas cell and blits it once
//! (`glyph_blit_aa_outline 0x5cea30`, dispatched by `0x5cf310` off the font flags at
//! `[CGxFont+0x180]`), which is what makes an outlined string fade correctly: one quad, one alpha,
//! ring and fill thinning together. Stamping a ring behind a fill instead — which this codebase did
//! before the composite cell — blackens mid-fade on the `α(1−α)` compositing term.
//!
//! Under the size ladder these variants had to be **planned**: a census walked the shipped
//! `Fonts.xml` registry for every `(face, size, radius)` triple anything could ask for, baked those,
//! and left any unplanned runtime combination to a legacy stamped-halo fallback. On demand
//! (decision 1342) there is nothing to plan and no fallback to keep: a radius that is asked for is a
//! radius that is rasterized, so the composite cell is now the only outline path there is.

/// The cell radius for a font's outline flag: the ring reach in **logical** px (`r=1` NORMAL,

/// 3. **Alpha** per texel = [`AA_NEIGHBOUR_LUT`]`[count of marked cells in the in-bounds 3×3

/// white fill takes the text tint, black ring stays black — and ONE alpha per pass, so a frame fade
/// thins ring+fill together (no `α(1−α)` blackening, the defect the stamped halos had).
///
/// Returns `(rgba, out_w, out_h, pad)`: the cell grows by `pad = r·round(dpi)` texels each side
/// (the binary's cell `em+2/+4` and origin col `1/2`, generalized); the caller shifts bearings by
/// `pad`. The advance is untouched — the step law owns tracking (THICK `+1`, NORMAL none).
