//! **The font engine, as the script VM holds it** — the app's half of
//! [`benilla_ui::script::TextMeasure`].
//!
//! The engine seam (`benilla-ui`'s `script::measure`) exists because the reference answers
//! `GetStringWidth` from its font engine *inline* and ours could not: measuring needed the atlas,
//! and the atlas only met the VM at the frame boundary. What closes the gap is that the client's
//! width law is a **table**, not a computation — a sum of per-glyph steps with no kerning and no
//! neighbour term — so a measure needs only the face, the raster size, and the characters.
//!
//! **The same engine, not a copy of it.** This holds the very [`TextEngine`] the render path holds,
//! behind the same lock, so the answer a Lua call gets mid-tick and the answer the extract pass
//! computes are not merely equal — they are the same lookup in the same table. That property used
//! to be bought by making the table immutable and `Arc`-sharing it; since decision 1342 the table
//! fills on demand, so the sharing has to carry mutation, and the lock is how. A measure fills only
//! the **metrics** half ([`TextEngine::ensure_metrics`]): a string that is measured and never drawn
//! costs a shaping, never a raster and never a texture page.
//!
//! **One body, both callers.** [`measure_request`] is the whole of it; the batch pass
//! (`ui_script::extract::measure_fontstrings`) and [`AtlasMeasurer`] both call it and neither has
//! any measuring logic of its own. That is the trait's own contract, kept structurally rather than
//! by discipline.
