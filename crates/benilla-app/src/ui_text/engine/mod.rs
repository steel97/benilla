//! **The font engine** — an on-demand glyph cache keyed by exact integer device-pixel size.
//!
//! ## What this replaced, and why
//!
//! Until decision 1342 this module *baked*: at startup (and, after 1296, whenever the raster
//! environment moved) it rasterized the whole charset for every registered face at a fixed
//! **ladder** of sizes, packed it into one texture, and published it. A request for a size the
//! ladder did not carry snapped to the nearest rung, and the finished quads were then rescaled by
//! `k = requested / snapped`.
//!
//! That rescale is gone, and with it the ladder. It had to be, because `k` was never a rendering
//! detail — it was a second, parallel definition of where text sits, and every seam that forgot to
//! apply it produced a measure/render disagreement: a caret 28 % past its own text (0989), an
//! ellipsis eating a word that fits (B209), a tooltip past its border (B231), a Main Menu label
//! losing its last letter (1339). And one that names the mechanism better than any of them:
//! **letters that do not share a baseline.** That is what a rescale *is*. The emit pass rounds each
//! glyph onto the device-pixel grid — uniformly, so the line is flat — and the rescale then
//! multiplies each rounded position by a non-integer `k` about an anchor. Glyphs have different
//! vertical offsets (an `O` is not an `x` is not a `p`), so after the multiply every letter lands on
//! a *different* sub-pixel phase and resamples at a different offset. The line stops being a line.
//! No amount of care at the call sites fixes that; only not having a `k` does.
//!
//! ## What the real client does
//!
//! wow-re `system/font` (T3, verified — the lifecycle re-derived by a four-pair cross-check for
//! decision 1342): a `CGxFont` exists per (face, flags, **exact pixel size**), the size being
//! `min(32, round(H · max(reqSize, 2/H)))` (`0x5ca030` → `[CGxFont+0x24c]`) — integer device
//! pixels, always. Glyphs are rasterized **on demand** by `NewCodeDesc` (`0x5cabd0`) into a
//! per-font `TSHashTable<codepoint → CharCodeDesc>` (`+0x30/+0x38`) and land in a row-partitioned
//! texture cache (`texcache_set_cellsize` `0x5cf360`, cell size `em + 2·outline pad`, free-slot
//! search `0x5cf5a0`) of up to 8 pages (`CGxFont+0x18c`). One bitmap per (font, codepoint), zero
//! subpixel phases — the face is sized by `FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes` to a square integer ppem and the
//! module calls no `FT_Set_Transform` anywhere.
//!
//! There is no size ladder and no snapping. **`k` has no counterpart in the ordinary UI path**,
//! and the reason is precise: `CSimpleFontString`'s constructor sets the one-to-one bit
//! (`+0x120 & 0x200`, `0x770dd3`), which makes `GetFontHeight` return the font's own quantized em
//! back — so the draw's `scale = ScreenToPixelHeight / [CGxFont+0x24c]` comes out exactly `1.0`
//! and every glyph is an integer 1 texel : 1 pixel blit.
//!
//! So: [`TextEngine::ppem`] rounds a logical height to whole device pixels, everything downstream
//! is keyed by that integer, and [`TextEngine::logical_size`] is the `0x200` bit — the size a
//! string measures and lays out at is the size its glyphs were rasterized at, not the float that
//! was asked for. That is the mechanism that makes a rescale unnecessary, and it is the one worth
//! copying. (It is also the modern idiomatic design: cosmic-text's `SwashCache` over a shelf
//! allocator, which is what glyphon and egui do.)
//!
//! ## Where this deliberately goes further — and where it is thinner
//!
//! Being exact about the divergences, because "the client does it this way" is doing a lot of work
//! above and it should not be doing more than it has earned:
//!
//! - **The client scales cells in three places, and we scale in none.** `SetTextHeight` clears the
//!   one-to-one bit (`0x771600`) and draws at a size the atlas was not rasterized for; a requested
//!   em past 32 px clamps the raster while the numerator keeps growing; and every 3-D unit name
//!   goes through `UNIT_NAME_FONT` (created at size `0.99f`, so its em is permanently 32) with
//!   string flag `0x80` — the explicit magnified mode, ±½-texel UV insets and all. We rasterize
//!   all three at their true size instead. That is not a new posture: it is exactly the recorded
//!   divergence at [`super::FONTSTRING_EM_CAP`] — the 32-px ceiling is 2004 raster-memory
//!   budgeting, and following it literally on a modern display converges every string toward the
//!   same size and stretches the ones above it (the era's blurry big crits). **Crisper than the
//!   reference, on purpose, in the same three places we had already chosen to be.**
//! - **Measuring rasterizes, in the client.** All five measure/layout kernels
//!   (`0x5c6940`, `0x5c6b70`, `0x5c6c50`, `0x5c7300`, `0x5c7470`) call `NewCodeDesc`
//!   unconditionally per character, and its miss branch runs `FT_Load_Glyph` + `FT_Render_Glyph`
//!   with no flag that can skip the render — the advance the measure needs is written *by the
//!   rasterizer*. [`TextEngine::ensure_metrics`] is therefore a **divergence**: we shape for the
//!   metrics and skip the bitmap. It produces the same number (the step law reads only the
//!   advance) and it is what makes a `GetStringWidth` probe over a string nobody draws cost no
//!   texture at all.
//! - **The client evicts, we reset.** `NewCodeDesc`'s full-atlas path (`0x5cad2b`) is a true LRU
//!   over `[CGxFont+0x64..0x6c]`: evict the single least-recently-used glyph, free its cell, repack
//!   into the hole, and dirty every string on that font that used that page. We drop everything at
//!   once instead ([`super::pack::Sheet::reset`]) — coarser, but our sheet is far larger than the
//!   client's 256×256 pages, and a shelf allocator cannot reclaim an interior cell without the
//!   repack the client's row lists are built for. Recorded, with the occupancy instrument that
//!   would overturn it.
//! - **The client flushes on a viewport change; we do not.** `0x5c2b50` (edge-triggered from the
//!   OS resize event) walks every live `CGxFont` and calls `0x5ca6f0`, which clears the whole glyph
//!   cache in place and re-issues `FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes` — keeping the FreeType face. That is a
//!   perfectly good answer to raster-size churn and we may yet want it; what stopped us taking it
//!   now is that our nameplate meshes bake UVs, so a flush costs a mesh rebuild on every resize
//!   frame, while simply *keeping* the dead cells costs only sheet space. Same instrument decides.
//!
//! ## The shape of the thing
//!
//! Two caches, filled by one operation and read by two very different callers:
//!
//! - **[`CharCell`]** — per `(face, ppem, char)`: which glyphs the character shapes to, their
//!   advances, and the pre-summed floor the width law needs. **Never touches the GPU**, which is
//!   what lets the script VM's synchronous measurer fill it from inside a Lua call.
//! - **The cells** — per `(face, glyph, ppem, outline radius)`: a rasterized bitmap packed into a
//!   [page][super::pack]. Only the emit pass asks for these.
//!
//! Both live in one engine behind one lock, shared by the render path and the VM's measurer, so a
//! string measured mid-tick and the same string measured at extract are not merely equal numbers —
//! they are the same lookup in the same table. (That was already 1289's property; it survives the
//! rewrite because it is the property that keeps measure and render from drifting.)
//!
//! **Lock discipline:** the guard is taken by a leaf entry point and released before it returns.
//! Nothing may hold it across a call into the script VM — the VM's measurer takes the same lock.
