//! Split from the emit pass ([`super`]) at decision 1342, which is when the split finally became
//! honest. Under the size ladder these two halves computed in *different spaces*: measure answered
//! in drawn px and the emit pass laid out at the snapped size, with a rescale between them, so
//! every fit decision had to be converted back and forth and each conversion was a place to get it
//! wrong (1339's fault 1 — an auto-sized label wrapping inside its own measured width). With the
//! raster size an exact integer, both halves work in one space over one table, and the seam between
//! them is just "who calls whom".
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of `(face, ppem, outline bias, characters)`. That is the
//! client's own law — `ComputeStep 0x5ca2d0` has no kerning term and no neighbour term — and it is
//! what lets a measure be answered from inside a Lua call, where a shaper could never reach.
