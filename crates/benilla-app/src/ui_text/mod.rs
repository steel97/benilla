//! Text rendering for `QuadContent::Text` (decision 0068 §2): an on-demand glyph cache over the
//! client's own TTFs, shaped through `cosmic-text` 0.16, emitted as [`crate::ui_pass::UiQuad`]s the
//! quad pass draws with no special case.
//!
//! - [`engine`] — the cache: faces, the size law, and the two lookup tables everything else reads.
//! - [`pack`] — the texture the cells live in, and how they get there.
//! - [`outline`] — the client's outline blit recipe, run per cell.
//! - [`layout`] — the emit pass, and (in `layout::measure`) the width law, the wrap and the
//!   ellipsis seam.
//! - [`measurer`] — the same engine, as the script VM holds it for a synchronous `GetStringWidth`.
//!
//! ## Font objects (decision 0084) and remaining v1 simplifications
//!
//! - **Per-`FontString` size + face.** [`QuadContent::Text`] now carries the resolved `{ font, height }`
//!   from the engine's font registry (`Fonts.xml`'s named virtual `<Font>` objects). A `FontString`
//!   with no font object falls back to Friz Quadrata at [`DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE`] (the pre-0084 behavior).
//! - **One exact raster size, on demand** (decision 1342). A logical height becomes the integer
//!   device-pixel size it will be drawn at (`round(height × scale_factor)` — the client's own
//!   `0x5ca030` law), and the glyphs for that size are rasterized the first time anything asks for
//!   them. There is no size ladder, no snapping, and no rescale of finished quads: the size a
//!   string is measured at, rasterized at, and drawn at is one number. See [`engine`] for what that
//!   replaced and why.
//! - **Outlines are one composite cell.** An outlined glyph's black ring and its fill are
//!   rasterized together into a single cell and blitted once — the client's own baked-outline
//!   architecture (`glyph_blit_aa_outline 0x5cea30`; see [`outline`]), which is what makes an
//!   outlined string fade as one thing instead of blackening. The Number* fonts (action-bar
//!   hotkeys/counts) carry it.
//! - **`justifyH` and `justifyV` are honored** (see [`layout_text_quads`]): lines justify
//!   horizontally per line, and the line block vertically (default MIDDLE, the client's
//!   FontString default — what seats sized labels like the money numbers on their icons'
//!   centerline).
//! - **`|T...|t` inline textures are stripped**, matching the probe — a `FontString` never draws an
//!   inline icon in v1.
//!
//! ## The metric-fidelity seam
//!
//! `cosmic-text`'s shaper is used for glyph SELECTION and rasterization, **one character at a
//! time** ([`engine::TextEngine::ensure_char`]); the pen then **advances by the client's own step
//! law** (wow-re `system/font`): per glyph, `floor(advance) + 1` px (`rasterize_glyph` 0x5d1120's
//! `out[5] = (FT_advance>>6)+1.0`), plus another `+1` for a **THICK**-outlined font only
//! (`GlyphStepBase` 0x5ca2b0 biases solely under the THICK flag — `outline-bake-tint.md`,
//! correcting this module's earlier any-outline reading) — the extra tracking that makes real
//! client text read wider/denser than raw font metrics.
//!
//! Per character is not a shortcut; it is the law. The client's `ComputeStep` (0x5ca2d0) has no
//! neighbour term, so a string's width is a pure function of its characters — which is what lets
//! one table answer a measure and a draw, and what lets a measure be answered from inside a Lua
//! call. It is a property of the FONTS that the decomposition holds (no ligatures, no contextual
//! substitution in these four faces), so it is asserted directly rather than assumed:
//! `engine::differential_tests`.
//!
//! Remaining divergences, all confined here: kerning is dropped entirely (the client applies only
//! *negative* pair kerns and rounds — ~0 at UI sizes; the test that pins the width law also pins
//! that this is what we are doing), and glyph BITMAPS are cosmic/swash unhinted coverage where the
//! client runs 2004-era FreeType with hinting flags (0x208a/0x20c2) — slightly slimmer stems at
//! small sizes. A future bit-exact replacement (wow-re's font kernel) only changes this module;
//! nothing in its callers moves. The deliberate *rendering* divergences — where the client stretches
//! a cell and we rasterize the true size — are named in [`engine`]'s module doc.
