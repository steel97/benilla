//! Text rendering for `QuadContent::Text` (decision 0068 §2): a glyph atlas baked from the client's
//! own TTFs, shaped through `cosmic-text` 0.16, emitted as [`crate::ui_pass::UiQuad`]s the quad pass
//! draws with no special case. Ported from `probes/text-glyph/src/{font,atlas,markup,layout}.rs`
//! (screenshot-verified there, 2026-07-02) into the real render path; the port's only structural change
//! is the font source (the app's own [`WorldAssets`] patch chain, not a probe-local `Chain::open`) and
//! the output type (this crate's real `UiQuad`, not the probe's mirror struct).
//!
//! ## Font objects (decision 0084) and remaining v1 simplifications
//!
//! - **Per-`FontString` size + face.** [`QuadContent::Text`] now carries the resolved `{ font, height }`
//!   from the engine's font registry (`Fonts.xml`'s named virtual `<Font>` objects). The atlas bakes
//!   every registered client TTF at each of [`FONT_SIZES`]; [`layout_text_quads`] selects the face by
//!   `font` path (via [`UiFontAtlas::path_to_family`]) and the nearest baked size. A `FontString` with
//!   no font object falls back to Friz Quadrata at [`DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE`] (the pre-0084 behavior).
//! - **DPI-aware bake.** The atlas is baked at `logical_size × Window::scale_factor` (physical
//!   resolution), and [`layout_text_quads`]/[`measure_text`] shape at that physical size, divide the
//!   metrics back to logical, and snap glyph origins to the physical-pixel grid — so a baked cell
//!   draws one texel per device pixel instead of a half-res bitmap upscaled by a retina framebuffer.
//! - **Outlines are rasterized** as the classic bitmap outline: [`layout_text_quads`] stamps each
//!   glyph's baked coverage in black over a filled `r×r` neighbourhood (`r=1` NORMAL, `r=2` THICK)
//!   behind the fill — `cosmic-text` has no native outline. The Number* fonts (action-bar
//!   hotkeys/counts) carry it.
//! - **`justifyH` and `justifyV` are honored** (see [`layout_text_quads`]): lines justify
//!   horizontally per line, and the line block vertically (default MIDDLE, the client's
//!   FontString default — what seats sized labels like the money numbers on their icons'
//!   centerline).
//! - **`|T...|t` inline textures are stripped**, matching the probe — a `FontString` never draws an
//!   inline icon in v1.
//!
//! ## The metric-fidelity seam
//!
//! [`layout_text_quads`] shapes every run through `cosmic-text`'s shaper for glyph SELECTION and
//! rasterization, but the pen now **advances by the client's own step law** (wow-re
//! `system/font`): per glyph, `floor(advance) + 1` px (`rasterize_glyph` 0x5d1120's
//! `out[5] = (FT_advance>>6)+1.0`), plus another `+1` for a **THICK**-outlined font only
//! (`GlyphStepBase` 0x5ca2b0 biases solely under the THICK flag — `outline-bake-tint.md`,
//! correcting this module's earlier any-outline reading) — the extra tracking that makes real
//! client text read wider/denser than raw font metrics. Remaining divergences, all confined here: kerning is dropped (the client applies only
//! negative pair kerns and rounds — ~0 at UI sizes), the law is applied at logical ppem (the
//! 768-window reference look), and glyph BITMAPS are cosmic/swash unhinted coverage where the
//! client runs 2004-era FreeType with hinting flags (0x208a/0x20c2) — slightly slimmer stems at
//! small sizes. A future bit-exact replacement (wow-re's font kernel) only changes this module;
//! nothing in its callers moves.
