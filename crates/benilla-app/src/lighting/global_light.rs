//! The **one shared global light** — the faithful replacement for the per-material light copy.
//!
//! The real 1.12 client has a single scene light every draw reads; updating it is O(1). We used to
//! store the resolved [`super::WowLighting`] *per material* and re-push it into every loaded terrain/
//! model/liquid/wdl material each frame — Bevy then freed+recreated every material's bind group
//! (`bevy_pbr` material.rs has an explicit "no fast path; we delete and recreate" TODO), a confirmed
//! ~40fps tax.
//!
//! Instead: ONE persistent GPU storage buffer, created once from the main-world [`RenderDevice`]; every
//! material references it via `#[storage(90, read_only, buffer)]` (a pre-made `Buffer`, baked into the
//! bind group at prepare, zero per-frame upload — `#[uniform]` can't do this, it always re-allocates). The
//! material assets are **never mutated after creation**, so no bind group is ever rebuilt. Each frame
//! [`build_light_data`] (main world) packs the resolved light into a std430 blob and [`upload_light`]
//! (render world, `PrepareResources`) writes it in place — all bind groups see the new data, zero
//! rebuilds, regardless of how many tiles/models are loaded or how fast the clock moves.
