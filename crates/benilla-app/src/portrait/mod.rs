//! Unit-frame **portraits** — the modern 2D take on the player/target face windows.
//!
//! The real 1.12 client renders a unit's model **once** into a tiny (64²) off-screen texture and
//! freezes it (re-baked only on model change), then stamps a round alpha stencil into it; the low
//! resolution is a 2004 shortcut, not a look (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/portrait-render.md`, §5-verified).
//! benilla keeps the *idea* — a flat 2D face in the ring — but bakes it properly: a **high-resolution**
//! off-screen render of the unit's real model, so the still is crisp. No live 3D widget sits in the UI;
//! what lands in the circle is a plain rendered image (director's call).
//!
//! ## The "photo booth"
//!
//! Each portrait slot (`"player"`/`"target"`) gets its own render layer + camera rendering into a
//! [`PortraitImages`] entry. A third slot — `"paperdoll"` (decision 0208 §5) — reuses the exact same
//! bake pipeline for the character window's **full-body** model pane: it mirrors the *player's*
//! dressed look like the `"player"` slot, but frames it through the model's own `<PlayerModel>`
//! camera ([`framing::body_frame`] — raw `cameras[1]`, not the authored bust camera the round
//! portraits use; decision 1089), bakes at 512², and spins the
//! model to a live yaw ([`PaperDollBooth`], the ref's `Model:SetRotation`). The UI samples it
//! *square*, not through the circular mask.
//!
//! The parts baked are the unit's **live dressed look** — the attach path's
//! spawned children (geosets already appearance-filtered; materials already carrying the composited
//! body skin / hair / NPC atlas), each stamped with a [`PortraitPart`] naming its static bind-pose
//! mesh twin + steady exterior material. Mirroring the children (not the shared display cache) means
//! the portrait can never drift from what's standing in the world, and gear/appearance rebuilds
//! re-bake automatically (the parts key changes). While a live unit's model is still loading, the
//! slot shows the ref's own 2D stand-in (`TemporaryPortrait-{Sex}-{Race}` / `-Monster`, RE C5) via
//! [`PortraitSource::File`].
//!
//! ## Framing: the model's own authored camera
//!
//! The framing is the model's **authored portrait camera** — the MD20 camera `cameraLookup[0]`
//! selects (VERIFIED, wow-re `system/ui/scratch/portrait-render.md` §4 + corrected verdict
//! `aa186e79`): the real bake builds `lookAt(eye, target, up-from-roll)` + the gxumath
//! *diagonal-FOV* perspective at the portrait path's aspect, which is **1.0 on every screen** —
//! net vertical half-angle `fov/(2√2)`, isotropic (`framing::WowPortraitProjection`, decision
//! 1543) — and **no** engine-side yaw or normalization on top. Every artist calibrated camera 0 to their
//! own model — that is the whole mechanism behind the ref's uniformly tight, consistently-angled
//! face crops across humans, wolves, and rabbits. It supersedes the first RE verdict's C4 ("framing
//! is not model data"), corrected on the wow-re record. A camera-less model (a few creatures,
//! props) falls back to [`frame`]'s heuristic head-anchor framing.
//!
//! ## Pose: a fresh instance at Stand
//!
//! The bake is **posed like the ref's** (wow-re §4 D2): a fresh throwaway instance — the booth's
//! own joint hierarchy + the parts' skinned twins — armed to the model's Stand (anim id 0 through
//! its own baked resolution, the ref's loader-idle seed) and frozen, never the unit's live world
//! pose. Bone riders (helm/shoulder armor, held items) ride their bone's joint, so they sit in
//! the Stand pose exactly like the world instance ([`PortraitRider`]; the ref resets the attach
//! *sockets* the same way, RE C3). See [`spawn_booth_model`].
//!
//! ## Deviations from the ref (deliberate) and what's still coarse
//!
//! High-res (256² vs 64²), a fixed neutral **studio light** on the round portraits (vs the ref's
//! ambient state — the *body* panes instead carry the reference's own `<PlayerModel>` light, see
//! [`model_pane_light`]), continuous
//! booth render vs dirty-byte bake, and the frozen Stand *phase* is t=0 (the ref's sampling clock
//! is the verdict's one unsettled INFERRED point — t≈0 vs live phase; both are Stand, and t=0
//! reproduces the ref wolf's open mouth). The creature *loading* stand-in is `-Monster` (our
//! pick — the ref's `-Pet` belongs to its pet-frame delegate).
//! `WOW_PORTRAIT_TEST=<Model\Path.mdx>` (+ `WOW_PORTRAIT_TEST_SKIN=<blp>`) bakes that model into
//! every slot (both portraits + the paper doll's body framing) to eyeball the pipeline without a server.
