//! The GLUE booth (decisions 0423 + 0465) — one booth slot serving both pre-world screens,
//! tuple-driven with **no wire entity**: the per-race `UI_<Race>` background scene with a character
//! standing in it — the character being *built* (char create, naked + underwear) or the selected
//! roster character (char select, geared from its enum record) — live, rotatable, fullscreen.
//!
//! The heavy lifting (displayId → model → geoset filter → composited skin → equipment riders) is
//! the entities module's [`crate::entities::attach`] glue-preview builder, which writes the
//! assembled part + rider lists into [`GluePreviewBake`] — it owns the attach path's resources, so
//! the booth doesn't re-implement them. This module owns the *booth* half, exactly like
//! [`super::sync_paperdoll`] does for the character window's paper doll: mirror the parts onto the
//! scene's authored light rig (or the studio buffer scene-less), pose a fresh instance via
//! [`super::spawn_booth_model`] — **looping Stand**, not a frozen still — seat riders on its
//! joints, and spin the root to the screen's live [`GluePreview::yaw`]. The bake lands in
//! [`super::PortraitImages`] under [`GLUE_SLOT`], sampled full-bleed by whichever glue screen is
//! up.
