///
/// **…as far as the art goes** (decision 1619, B330). Every diorama is finite — a sky card of some

/// 1.31, Scourge 1.57, Tauren 1.46). So the wide leg grows the width only to a ceiling and past it
/// **holds the width and closes the vertical** — the zoom the reference does everywhere, done only
/// where the art forces it. The narrow leg does the same with `art.half_h`, and the authored box
/// itself is never given up (`max(t0)`): a scene whose art does not fill 4:3 is the art's problem,
/// not a reason to zoom past the composition.
///
/// **…and never tighter than the reference at 16:9.** Holding the width zooms faster than the
/// reference's diagonal law, so left alone it re-crops the character at 21:9 (B242, the report
/// 1587 closed). The zoom has a floor ([`glue_zoom_floor`]): the reference's own 16:9 opening —
/// the tightest framing every race has been played at, on the most common panel, for fifteen
/// years, an empirical bound on "the character still fits", not a mechanism. (A floor of "what
/// 16:9 needs to reach this scene's art" was tried and clipped the night elf male's hair and
/// boots at 16:9 — 8% past the reference is past what fits.) Past the aspect where the floor's
/// opening cannot fill the ceiling's width, the scene is **pillarboxed** — rendered at that
/// aspect, centred, black either side — which is what the modern client does past 16:9 and the
/// only honest answer once the art is narrower than the window: not void (B330), not a crop
/// (B242), a frame.
///
/// **The ceiling is [`GLUE_BOX_ASPECT`]'s, not the scene's own** (decision 2187). 1619 read the
/// ceiling off each scene's measured art, so each of the seven boxed at its *own* aspect — 1.65:1
/// in the night elf grove, 1.93:1 at the gate — and the box is what the chrome's canvas insets by
/// (2091). Clicking a night elf on the character screen therefore moved the whole screen: at 16:9
/// the human, orc, scourge and tauren stages fill the window, the dwarves' boxes by a third of a
/// percent and the night elves' by 3.6% a side, so the backdrop and every panel over it jumped
/// inward and back as the selection moved down the roster. **One box for every scene** fixes that
/// at the cause: the frame is a property of the *window*, and nothing about it changes when the
