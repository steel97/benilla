///   @`0x50572e`), then **enables** it (`0x71b780(light, 1)` @`0x50576a`).
/// - It is the widget's ONLY light: the per-frame fill callback `0x76d680` (registered on the
///   model at `[model+0x3bc]` by `0x76cd30`) stages exactly this one, gated on its enable flag; the
///   widget's private scene container holds no others (a paper doll has no background scene M2
///   authoring lights, unlike the glue screens — wow-re `glue-model-lighting.md §0`), and
///   `CSimpleModel::SetLight` (`0x76cf30`) has exactly one caller in the whole binary — the Lua

/// — Bevy `(−1, 0, 0)` under [`wow_to_bevy`] — so it falls on the figure from its right, square
/// across the camera axis, since the body rig puts the eye on `−Z` looking at the model's front
/// ([`framing::body_frame`]). Everything the pane actually shows the viewer is therefore lit by
/// **ambient alone** (`0.7`), with the diffuse only grazing the figure's screen-left side (its own
/// right; 0638 had it grazing the screen-right side, the same grazing light from the opposite
/// side, which is why the A/B that approved 0638's look could not tell the two apart — 2034). The
