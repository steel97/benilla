//! The **talent spell-modifier tables** — the client-side half of every talent that cheapens a
//! spell, shortens its cast or cooldown, extends its range or radius, or lengthens its duration.
//!
//! Two `i32[64][29]` tables (`SPELLMOD_FLAT 0xcead60`, `SPELLMOD_PCT 0xcecb30`), one handler that
//! fills them (`Spell_C::HandleSetSpellModifier 0x6e9950`, registered for both
//! `SMSG_SET_FLAT_SPELL_MODIFIER` and `SMSG_SET_PCT_SPELL_MODIFIER` by `Spell_C::SystemInitialize
//! 0x6e7150`), and one reader that answers them (`GetSpellModifiers 0x6e6b30`). Every law here is
//! byte-VERIFIED in wow-re `system/spell/scratch/spellmod-table-law.md`; this module is that note
//! turned into the one place benilla asks "does a talent change this number?".
//!
//! **The index is `mask_bit * 29 + op`, in both directions, and it is the thing to get right.**
//! The writer multiplies its FIRST wire byte (`6e9993: imul eax,eax,0x1d`); the reader
//! strength-reduces the same address to `4*op + 0x74*i` over a loop counter bounded by
//! `cmp eax,0x40`, which forces the first factor to be the 0..63 `SpellFamilyFlags` **bit index**
//! and the second the 0..28 SpellModOp. The transposed form addresses 47% of the array
//! (`29*28 + 63 = 875` against 1856 cells) and makes writer and reader touch systematically
//! disjoint cells — every modifier silently dropped, nothing to see in a log. wow-re's own
//! `wave-handlers.md` carried the transposed form, `verified`, for months. [`index`] is the single
//! expression both sides here go through, so they cannot drift apart.
//!
//! The server agrees, independently and in source: vmangos `Player::SendSpellMod`
//! (`Objects/Player.cpp:17815`) loops `for (int eff = 0; eff < 64; ++eff)` over the modifier's own
//! 64-bit mask and writes `uint8(eff)`, `uint8(mod->op)`, `int32(val)` for each set bit — first
//! byte the family-flag bit, second the op — with `MAX_SPELLMOD = 29` as the enum's size.
//!
//! **The value is absolute.** The store is a plain `mov`, and vmangos `Player::SendSpellMod` sends
//! one packet per set mask bit carrying that `(bit, op)` pair's total. Nothing accumulates, nothing
//! expires, and there is no talent-change clear: a respec is a fresh set of absolute cells.
//!
//! **The read is three conjunct gates and then a sum over all 64 bits** ([`SpellModifiers::apply`]
//! via [`SpellModifiers::modifiers`]): the spell's `SpellFamilyName` must be nonzero, must equal
//! the local player's own class family ([`SpellModifiers::class_family`]), and the spell must not
//! carry `AttributesEx3` bit 29. Then every set bit of the spell's 64-bit `SpellFamilyFlags`
//! contributes one cell from each table — **no early break**, and the high dword is live (322
//! shipped spells set more than one bit; the highest index in the file is 35).
//!
//! **The trap this module's shape exists to make unrepresentable.** `0x6e6b30` has four exits.
//! Three write `(flat, pct) = (0, 100)`; the fourth — *the loop ran and nothing accumulated*, which
//! is the COMMON case — leaves `pct = 0`, because it never reaches the `add ebx,0x64`. The
//! reference gets away with it because all three appliers gate on the returned boolean. A
//! re-implementation that hands a caller a bare `(flat, pct)` pair multiplies every unmodified
//! spell by **zero**: every spell would cost 0 mana. So [`SpellModifiers::modifiers`] returns
//! `Option<SpellMod>` — `None` IS that exit, and it is not a pair anyone can multiply by — and
//! [`SpellMod`] is private with [`SpellMod::apply`] its only verb. `apply` is the reference's own
//! integer applier `0x6e6af0`, boolean gate included.
//!
//! ## The 29 ops
//!
//! All 29 are stored: the stride is what the index arithmetic is made of, and nine of them have no
//! reader anywhere in the reference image while the handler will happily write them. The numbers
//! are VERIFIED (every one of the 35 call sites passes a literal); the names are vmangos
//! corroboration, and **op 24's name is INFERRED and suspect** — the client routes aura 65
//! (*casting speed*) to it while vmangos calls it `SPELL_BONUS_DAMAGE`, so key on the number.
//!

//! | 28 | RESIST_DISPEL_CHANCE | never read |
//!
//! ## Where this diverges from the reference, and why
//!
//! - **Both wire bytes are range-checked.** The reference checks neither: `field1 = 64, field2 = 19`
//!   writes at byte 7500 from the FLAT table's base — 76 past its end, straight onto `[0xcecaac]`,
//!   the class-family global the reader itself compares against — and `field1 = 65, field2 = 23`
//!   lands on element 0 of the PCT table. That is a buffer overrun, not a behaviour, and reproducing it is not
//!   fidelity. [`SpellModifiers::set`] drops the packet with a `warn!` naming both values.
//! - **The lifecycle hangs off the session edge, not a process global.** The reference clears both
//!   tables (and the class family) in `0x6e7150`, which runs once per **world-enter** — the Enter
//!   World click, through `CGlueMgr::Update 0x46b930` — and nowhere else; its teardown
//!   `Spell_C::Destroy 0x6e99e0` deliberately does not touch them. [`clear_on_world_enter`] is that
//!   same edge, `OnEnter(ClientState::InWorld)`.
