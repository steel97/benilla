//! The shared `AreaPOI.dbc` catalog — the world's named points of interest, and the **one** copy
//! of that table in the process.
//!
//! It used to live inside `MinimapAssets`, because the minimap's nearest-3 landmark blips
//! (decision 0203 phase 3) were its only reader. The world map is the second (decision 1586: the
//! `0x4a67a0` landmark pass — city icons, the "Under Attack" indicators, the Eastern Plaguelands
//! towers), and two owners of one DBC is how the two surfaces drift apart on what a POI *is*. So
//! it is hoisted here, beside [`crate::area::AreaTableRes`], on 0287's precedent — the same move,
//! for the same reason, on the sibling table.
//!
//! Loaded once at Startup; absent if the DBC failed to read, which every consumer takes as
//! `Option` and goes quiet about (no landmark blips, no map icons, everything else intact).
