//! Where benilla keeps **local state** — THE LAW (decision 0954, placement amended by 1175). Every
//! file benilla persists on a player's machine — config today; realmlist, caches, per-character
//! state as they arrive — lives in **one visible folder, `benilla-config/`, beside the benilla binary**.
//! Never scattered into the install, never hidden in a platform config dir: the 1.12 client is
//! itself fully portable (`WTF/`, `realmlist.wtf`, `Cache/` all in-folder — verified on the live
//! install), its community expects the drop-in-a-folder shape, and one folder answers "what here
//! is benilla's?" at a glance (the director's call, 2026-08-04; prior art: Dolphin's
//! `portable.txt`, DREAMM's config-next-to-exe).
//!
//! **0954 put this folder inside the WoW install and 1175 moved it out**, on the director's word:
//! *the benilla folder should be outside the wow folder … in root of the project or same folder as
//! the benilla binary.* 0954's reasoning was sound for what it knew — `$WOW_DATA` was the only
//! root the client reliably had — but it made benilla's own state a *guest* of the install, so
//! pointing at a second install silently swapped your keybinds and a data path that failed to
//! resolve took your config with it. benilla reads a WoW install; it does not live in one. One
//! behaviour improves as a result: the state folder no longer depends on finding the install at
//! all. Everything else about 0954 stands, including this module being the only place in the tree
//! that may compute a persistence path (grep `local_state::` for every resident) — new files get a
//! name here and a line in 0954's layout table.
//!
//! Resolution, in order — deliberately the **same three-step shape** as
//! [`benilla_formats::wow_data`], because it is one law over two folders:
//! 1. **`$BENILLA_HOME`** — explicit override (tests point it at a tempdir; a shared-config setup
//!    points it wherever it likes).
//! 2. **`<project folder>/benilla-config/`** — `#[cfg(feature = "dev")]` only, so dev runs across the
//!    worktree pool keep one predictable place. Gated for the same reason the install resolver's
//!    project-folder probe is: a shipped binary must not carry the build machine's source tree.
//!    (`.gitignore` carries `/benilla-config` for it.)
//! 3. **`<exe dir>/benilla-config/`** — the release answer: your settings sit next to the program that
//!    wrote them.
//!
//! **Capture/probe runs are hermetic**: with `$WOW_CAPTURE` set every path resolves to `None` —
//! a deterministic capture must not read one machine's saved settings or write anything back
//! (the harness owns its inputs; decision 0008's reproducibility posture).
