//! **Key bindings** (decision 0997) — the one chord→command engine every rebindable input runs
//! through, replacing the per-site hardcoded key reads (and the four independent copies of
//! 0585's bare-binding modifier rule they carried).
//!
//! The split mirrors the CVar table (0954): the **string-domain truth** lives engine-side
//! ([`benilla_ui::script::keybind`] — the table the Key Bindings window's Lua edits
//! synchronously), and this module derives the app's **dispatch view** from it whenever its
//! generation moves: canonical chord strings parsed ([`chord`]) into an exact-match map.
//!
//! Dispatch (the [`latch_and_dispatch`] system, ordered inside [`crate::ui_script::UiInput`]
//! right after the UI key feed):
//! - a press probes its **exact** chord and then, only on a miss, **once more** with its leftmost
//!   modifier dropped ([`Chord::fallback`], decision 1142) — which is why `Shift`+`W` walks while
//!   `SHIFT-W` is bound to nothing, and why a bound `SHIFT-TAB` still beats bare `TAB` (the exact
//!   probe is always first). Super held matches nothing;
//! - [`Kind::Held`] commands **latch** on the matching press and unlatch on the *base key's*
//!   release — the reference's `runOnUp` movement law, which is why tapping Shift mid-run does
//!   not stop you, and why **nothing the UI does stops you**: a chat box taking focus and a
//!   fullscreen frame eating a key both suppress the *press* and release nothing already held
//!   (decision 2196). The only things that end a latch are the base key's release, the
//!   [stuck-latch sweep](latch_and_dispatch) that stands in for a release the window never saw
//!   (OS focus loss, the loading cover), and the VM swap;
//! - [`Kind::Edge`]/[`Kind::EdgeUpDown`] run their 1.12 Lua bodies in the VM;
//! - [`Kind::Host`] lands in [`BindingsState::fired`] for engine consumers (chat open, TAB
//!   targeting, nameplates, autorun, camera zoom, …).
//!
//! **An addon's `Bindings.xml` rows dispatch here too** (decision 1188 phase 4). They are not in
//! [`SPECS`] — they are read off disk at addon load ([`benilla_ui::bindings_xml`]) — so a resolved
//! chord names a [`Bound`], which is either a registry [`Cmd`] or an index into this frame's
//! addon table. That enum is the whole design: an addon row is a *runtime* `String` body run with
//! the reference's `keystate` global, and every `SPECS[cmd]` in this file would be a latent panic
//! if it were instead an index past the end of the static table.
//!
//! While the Keybindings page (the Options window's category since 1008) has a capsule
//! selected it arms the **capture seam** (`BenillaBindCapture`): raw input is swallowed here,
//! canonicalized (`ALT-CTRL-SHIFT-<TOKEN>`), and handed back to the page's own capture handler
//! — the 1.12 law (lone modifiers ignored, left/right clicks stay UI clicks, ESC binds like
//! any key).
//!
//! Persistence: `benilla-config/bindings/account.txt` + `<Realm>-<Char>.txt` ([`store`], through
//! [`crate::local_state`]); the character file's existence is the character-set state, deleted
//! on the confirmed switch back to general — the reference's own semantics.

    // slot (`[root+0x1134]`, event category 2, payload 0 = deactivate), so it is the **OS
    // window-deactivate** handler, not a UI-focus one (wow-re `loading-screen-input-law.md`; the
    // conflated phrasing was `rf79-autorun-cancel-set.md`'s "Chat EditBox / window focus" row).
    // In the reference a focused box merely turns the movement handlers into no-ops and the
    // direction bits are *frozen, not cleared* — so holding W and pressing ENTER keeps you
    // running, and the world map eating the `M` that closes it keeps you running too. Both
    // regressions were one clear.

    // The window-deactivate clear needs no code of its own: bevy's `KeyboardFocusLost` →

    // - **WM_ACTIVATE's wipe of the pressed-key set comes for free.** `KeyboardFocusLost` →
    //   `ButtonInput::release_all` empties the plane, so a key still physically held across an
    //   alt-tab is no longer on the list when we come back, and its next auto-repeat is therefore
    //   a fresh DOWN that re-latches. That is the reference's own behaviour and not a happy
    //   accident: `0x514490` cleared the direction bits on the way out, and `0x424790`'s wipe of
    //   the pressed-key set is what lets the first repeat put them back — so you resume running
