//! The world-map data feed (decision 0203 phase 2) — the app half behind
//! stock `Interface\FrameXML\WorldMapFrame.xml` and benilla-ui's `script/worldmap.rs` bindings.
//!
//! A seed and a feed, the quest-log seam shape:
//! - [`seed_world_map_catalog`] (at the world-entry edge, before any interface file runs — 2240):
//!   builds the static **catalog** from `WorldMapArea` × `AreaTable` × `WorldMapContinent` ×
//!   `Map` × the `.zmp` bitmaps and pushes it into the engine. Every ordering/naming rule is the
//!   wow-re-verified one (Q1/Q3 verdicts, 2026-07-07): continents in WorldMapArea **file
//!   order** (Kalimdor, then EK — the `0x4a5d00` builder's walk), displayed under their
//!   `Map.dbc` localized names ("Eastern Kingdoms", not the art folder's "Azeroth"); zones
//!   sorted case-insensitively by AreaTable localized name (the `0x4a6390` comparator's
//!   `SStrCmpI`); the zone grids remapped from raw AreaTable ids by the client's one-hop parent
//!   rollup + (mapId, areaId) match — here straight to 1-based zone indices. Beside that it
//!   builds the **orphan list** ([`DirectAreaEntry`]) — the instance maps, which belong to no
//!   continent and so appear in neither list above; the reference fills the same second container
//!   in the same walk (`0x4a5d00`), and it is what the `−2` direct-area selection resolves
//!   against.
//! - [`feed_world_map`] (every frame): reads the engine-owned selection back, projects the
//!   player's world position onto the displayed map via [`benilla_world::map_proj`] (world sheet:
//!   WorldMapContinent constants; continent/zone: the WorldMapArea rect lerp; an instance map:
//!   that row's own rect), resolves where the player's own position puts the selection
//!   ([`resolve_player_selection`], the reference's `0x4a6650` — continent × zone, then the
//!   orphan list) from `CurrentArea` through the AreaTable parent chain, and pushes the trio +
//!   facing. (The client matches its zone-level area global directly; our MCNK `CurrentArea` is
//!   the leaf sub-area, so the parent walk lands on the same zone.) It also runs the **landmark
//!   pass** — the reference's `0x4a67a0` builder
//!   ([`landmark_gates_pass`], decision 1586): the `AreaPOI.dbc` rows the displayed level admits,
//!   then the guard-directions marker. That pass is keyed rather than per-frame ([`LandmarkKey`]),
//!   because the reference rebuilds it on events, not on a clock.
//!
//! …and one dev affordance beside them, [`dev_map_jump`]: **Alt+click the map to go there.**
