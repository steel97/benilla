//! how long it will take (decision 1681).
//!
//! The realm server answers a login to a full realm with `SMSG_AUTH_RESPONSE(AUTH_WAIT_QUEUE)` and
//! a position, re-sending as the line moves and ending with `AUTH_OK` when we are admitted. It is
//! a **wait, not an outcome** — which is what benilla got wrong until this module: the world
//! handshake treated the code as a refusal, so a busy server was simply unreachable.
//!
//! Everything here is the reference's arithmetic, transcribed (VERIFIED, wow-re
//! `system/glue/scratch/login-failure-dialogs.md` §Q3). It is worth transcribing rather than
//! reinventing because the estimate is visibly wrong in a *specific* way — it divides before it
//! multiplies, so it truncates per-person seconds before scaling them by the whole queue — and a
//! "better" estimator would disagree with the reference by minutes on a long queue.
//!
//! Three things about it are deliberately NOT reproduced, each named at its site: the unguarded
//! 32-bit overflow, the stale-position redisplay on a truncated packet ([`benilla_protocol`]'s
//! parser), and the leading blank line the reference's composite prints.
