//! The login screen (decision 0539) — the faithful `AccountLogin` glue, functional core only:
//! the `UI_MainMenu` scene with its authored fog/fires, the account/password boxes, Remember
//! Account Name, Login/Quit, the version block, and the connecting/error dialogs. The Credits/
//! Cinematics/TOS side of the reference screen is deliberately cut (the director's call).
//!
//! This module owns the **credential policy** — the 0193 §3 mirror for the IO thread's pre-logon
//! park: the env fast path (any of `WOW_USER`/`WOW_PASS`/`WOW_CHAR` explicitly set auto-submits
//! with the old `one`/`pone` defaults, so every probe/smoke invocation keeps working), the
//! pending-credentials resubmit (paced at the flat 3 s, app-side — the IO thread never sleeps),
//! and the director's typed submit. A *refused* code (bad password) clears the intent and shows
//! the authored `AUTH_*` dialog — never an auto-retry against a refusal.
//!
//! **A session that is lost is over** (decision 1262): the reference's `GlueParent.lua` answers
//! `DISCONNECTED_FROM_SERVER` with `SetGlueScreen("login")` + `GlueDialog_Show("DISCONNECTED")`,
//! and so does this. 0065's seamless reconnect survives only where the run has *declared* that
//! nobody is here ([`crate::run_mode::unattended`], decision 1769) — because a client that
//! re-authenticates on its own takes the account back off whoever just displaced it.
//!
//! Module split: this file (state, policy, input, dialogs, the saved-account persistence),
//! [`screen`] (the authored layout, transcribed from `AccountLogin.xml`), [`smoke`] (the
//! `WOW_LOGIN_SMOKE` headless prover).
