//! The pet system — the app side of `benilla_ui::script::pet`'s seam (decision 0982), and the
//! home of [`PetBar`], the server-authoritative state `net/apply/pet.rs` writes.
//!
//! **One concern per file** (the split owed by decision 1003, restated by 1005, done in 1066). What
//! decides the cut is *which clock a thing moves on*, which is also why these never wanted to be
//! one file:
//!
//! | module | what it owns | moves on |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`bar`] | the action bar's **feed** — ten packed words rendered as ten `PetActionView`s | `SMSG_PET_SPELLS` |
//! | [`unit`] | the **`"pet"` unit token** and the pet frame's events | the pet's descriptor |
//! | [`drain`] | the bar's click **intents** → the wire, and the state they latch locally | a click |
//! | [`menu`] | the **right-click menu**: two predicates, three verbs | a menu pick |
//!
//! [`PetBar`], [`PetUnit`] and [`UiPetPlugin`] stay here, because every module reads them.
//!
//! **The slot law** (decode and constants in `benilla_protocol::messages::pet`, VERIFIED against
//! the client itself in decision 0988): each slot is one packed word whose type — bits 24–29,
//! **masked** — decides its whole reading:
//!
//! - `PET_ACT_COMMAND 7` — `action` is a `CommandStates`: Stay 0 / Follow 1 / Attack 2 / Dismiss 3.
//!   A token: `GetPetActionInfo` returns the NAMES of two globals rather than values (the
//!   reference's own `PetActionBarFrame.lua:98-104` fork), which `PetActionBar.xml` resolves —
//!   `PET_ACTION_*` out of the shipped `GlobalStrings.lua`, `PET_*_TEXTURE` out of the constants
//!   that file declares and ours quotes.
//! - `PET_ACT_REACTION 6` — `action` is a `ReactStates`: Passive 0 / Defensive 1 / Aggressive 2.
//!   Also a token.
//! - types **1–5** — `action` is a spell id, and the autocast pair rides in bits 31/30 rather than
//!   in the type. That split is why the server's `ACT_PASSIVE`/`ACT_DISABLED`/`ACT_ENABLED` are
//!   one branch here and not three.
//!
//! The two halves of `GetPetActionInfo`'s signature never overlap: `isActive` is a **token**
//! concept and `autoCast*` a **spell** one, each nil on the other's branch.
//!
//! The **3 commands / 4 spells / 3 reactions** arrangement everyone recognises is therefore
//! *server data*, not a layout: it is what `CharmInfo::InitPetActionBar` happens to write, and a
//! possessed minion or a charmed creature arrives with a different mix through the same ten words.
//! Nothing in this folder or in `PetActionBar.xml` assumes it.
