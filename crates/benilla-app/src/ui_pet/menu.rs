//! The pet **right-click menu** — its two predicates and its three verbs (decision 1066).
//!
//! `PetFrame_OnClick`'s else arm opens `PetFrameDropDown` on `UnitPopupMenus["PET"]`, whose four
//! rows are decided by `PetCanBeAbandoned()` alone (`UnitPopup.lua:402-416`): paperdoll and abandon
//! show when it is true, dismiss when it is false, rename when it and `PetCanBeRenamed()` both are.
//! So one predicate makes the same menu read *Abandon* on a hunter's pet and *Dismiss* on a
//! warlock's demon — and the row a player sees is the whole of the difference the client draws
//! between "give this pet up forever" and "send this summon away".
//!
//! **The predicates are VERIFIED at the bytes** (wow-re `ui/scratch/pet-action-bar-api.md` §11c,
//! carved for this build). `0x4be500` and `0x4be580` are byte-identical but for three dwords:
//! resolve `[0xb714a0]`, check the pet's `UNIT_FIELD_SUMMONEDBY` against the local player, then test
//! **one byte of `UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS`** — `[pet+0x110]+0xa0`, dword 46 — with mask `0x20` for abandon
//! (`0x4be544`) and `0x10` for rename (`0x4be5c4`). Each returns exactly one value on every path: a
//! double `1.0`, or nil.
//!
//! **The `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_2` byte-2 layout everybody remembers is REFUTED here** — that is the
//! TBC+ home of these bits, its record is dword 164, and neither predicate touches it. This is the
//! shape decision 0988 warns about, and it was one carve away from being built wrong: benilla's own
//! queue had recorded the TBC guess, off a field that is always zero on this server.
//!
//! **The two give-up verbs are NOT one opcode**, which is the correction that made carving them
//! worth it (the seam's two counts, kept apart on principle, are what made the fold a two-line
//! change):
//!
//! - `PetAbandon 0x4be4c0` → `0x4bd740` sends **`CMSG_PET_ABANDON` 0x176** `{u64 petGuid}`.
//! - `PetDismiss 0x4be4d0` → `0x4bd6e0` **opens no packet at all**. It stages the packed slot word
//!   `0x07000003` — command type 7, action 3, `PET_COMMAND_DISMISS` — and hands it to `0x4bd1d0`,
//!   the *same dispatcher every pet-bar click uses*, which sends **`CMSG_PET_ACTION` 0x175**
//!   `{u64 petGuid, u32 0x07000003, u64 0}`. Dismiss is a bar press with no button.
//!
//! Both would have worked against vmangos — `HandlePetAbandon` unsummons a non-hunter pet, and so
//! does `COMMAND_DISMISS` — which is exactly why the wrong one would never have been noticed.
