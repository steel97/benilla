//! The session preflight (decision 0649) — one always-on banner naming **what body we just logged
//! into**, plus loud warnings for the avatar states that silently invalidate a session's work.
//!
//! This is instrumentation for the *reader of the log*, not a game system. It exists because three
//! things cost a session ten minutes each and none of them announces itself:
//!
//! 1. **The character is dead or a ghost**, left that way by an earlier session. Nothing can be
//!    interacted with, attacked, looted or talked to; the world renders through the death filter;
//!    movement is rooted (unreleased) or ghost-speed (released). Every symptom reads like a client
//!    bug, and the client is fine.
//! 2. **GM mode is on** — which every probe character used to carry by default, as the only guard
//!    against unattended aggro killing it. vmangos's `Player::SetGameMaster` re-templates the player
//!    to **faction template 35** and freezes the mirror timers, so nothing is hostile, nothing
//!    aggros, fall/environmental damage is skipped and breath/fatigue never tick.
//!    FactionTemplate.dbc row 35 (VERIFIED from the extracted DBC): faction 31 "Friendly", own group
//!    mask 0, enemy mask 0 — it is hostile to nothing and nothing is hostile to it. Any hostility,
//!    reaction-colour, nameplate, aggro, threat, damage or drowning measurement taken with GM on is
//!    simply wrong, quietly. It also silently suspends the **indoor dismount**: the outdoor-only
//!    aura sweep is `!IsGameMaster()`-gated, so a GM rides into the Goldshire inn and stays mounted
//!    (decision 0934). It is now **off** by default: [`crate::probe_shield`] keeps the body
//!    alive without poisoning any of that (decision 0677), and this banner reports which it is.
//! 3. **Movement is server-blocked** — rooted, stunned, confused, fleeing, or mid-taxi-flight. The
//!    controller ignores input and the honest report is "the mover is broken".
//! 4. **The run has no server at all** ([`offline_notice`], decision 0728). Capture mode passes
//!    `NetPlugin { connect: false }`, so no IO thread is spawned and the drain receives nothing —
//!    the whole packet path (`net::apply`, the movement wire, every `MSG_MOVE_*`) simply does not
//!    execute. This one is the mirror image of the other three: they make a healthy client *look*
//!    broken, while this makes an untested change *look proven*. A capture run over a change to the
//!    packet path exits clean no matter what that change does, and "clean run" then lands in a
//!    commit message as evidence it never was (twice in one day — decisions 0725 and 0726, both
//!    pure wire work, both reported with a capture run behind them). The banner above cannot catch
//!    it: that one waits on [`EnteredWorldMessage`], which needs a server. So this notice fires at
//!    **startup**, before anything can be concluded from the run.
//!
//! 5. **Two `Camera2d`s on one target disagree about MSAA** ([`camera_2d_msaa_agrees`], decision
//!    1659). Not an avatar state, but the same shape as the four above: it is invisible until it
//!    kills the frame, and when it does, wgpu's `Attachments have differing sample counts` names
//!    two numbers and no camera. One scan on the frame the cameras spawn turns that into a line
//!    that names them.
//!
//! The banner is **not env-gated**: a warning nobody knows to switch on is not a warning. It costs
//! one line per world entry when everything is fine, and it re-fires on every re-entry (a relog, a
//! `.character race` forced logout, a reconnect) because the state can have changed.
//!
//! The same audience — the reader of the log — is why [`benilla_world::build_id::banner`] exists.
//! It is **not** registered here any more (decision 1179): this module is dev-only since 1174, and
//! "which build produced this log" is the first thing a report from *someone else's machine* has to
//! establish — which is precisely the player build. The banner now registers beside the stamp
//! itself, in `lib::run`, where it is always compiled.
//!
//! The other half of decision 0649 — the pre-connect **account guard**, which keeps a session
//! running inside a worktree pool slot from logging in as somebody else's account — lives in
//! [`crate::run_mode`] now, not here: it is consulted by the login policy, and 1174's seam does not
//! let gameplay call an instrument. Its reasoning went with it.
