//! The social session — the friend list, the ignore list, `/who`, and the system lines they
//! print (decision 0668).
//!
//! [`SocialState`] mirrors the wire the way [`crate::ui_party`]'s `GroupState` does: the three
//! server packets replace it wholesale or patch one row, and the feed turns it into the VM
//! snapshot the FriendsFrame reads. Two client-side laws from wow-re's `FriendList.cpp` findings
//! (`system/net/scratch/w2b.md`, the 0x728-byte object at `DAT_00c28168`) shape everything here:
//!
//! - **The lists are guids.** A friend slot holds `{status, note*, guid, area, level, class}` —
//!   no name — and the display name comes from the ObjectMgr name cache (`0x55f080`) at format
//!   time. So does ours ([`crate::names::NameCache`]), which is why a freshly-listed friend can
//!   take a name-query round trip to show a name, and why removal (a guid on the wire) has to
//!   look the name up first.
//! - **Selection is a guid too** (`+0x648` friend, `+0x720` ignore), converted to an index on
//!   read. Ours is stored the same way, so a list that re-sorts under a selection keeps the same
//!   player selected rather than the same row.
//!
//! ## The system lines
//!
//! Every friend/ignore result prints one line, and they go to the **chat frame**, not the red
//! error line. That is byte-settled rather than assumed: `FriendList::HandleResult 0x5acab0`
//! displays through `CGGameUI::DisplayError 0x496720` with catalog ids `0x104..0x114`, and each
//! of those rows' `+0x4` **kind** field is written from the register the independently-VERIFIED
//! kind-0 row `0x8b` (`ERR_QUEST_FAILED_S` → chat) also uses — `ecx`, i.e. **kind 0 = the chat
//! composer** (`0x49a870`). Read at the bytes in the table's static initializer,
//! `0x486f78`–`0x48719c` (base `0xb4b498`, stride `0x14`); record `0x115` is the first to take a
//! different register, which is exactly where the friend band ends.
//!
//! Which result maps to which GlobalStrings key is *inferred by name* (the `ERR_FRIEND_*` /
//! `ERR_IGNORE_*` set is one-to-one with vmangos's `FriendsResult` enum, and 18 results collapse
//! to the 17 ids because both ADDED codes share `ERR_FRIEND_ADDED_S`) — the open dispatch item in
//! the record.
//!
//! ## What the ignore list is *for*
//!
//! Not the window — the silence. `FriendList::IsIgnored 0x5ae5a0` gates inbound chat and text
//! emotes (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/text-emote-composition.md`: ignored performer ⇒ dropped
//! silently, no line at all) and the duel handler's auto-decline (`0x4d4a33`). [`is_ignored`] is
//! that predicate; its callers are the chat apply arm and the duel one, which is how decision
//! 0633's stated "no ignore list yet" deviation closes.
