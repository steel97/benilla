//! The chord codec (decision 0997): Bevy's physical input ↔ the reference's canonical binding
//! strings — `[ALT-][CTRL-][SHIFT-]<TOKEN>`, where the token set is 1.12's own (`W`, `SPACE`,
//! `NUMPAD0`, `BUTTON4`, `MOUSEWHEELUP`, the bare punctuation characters). These strings are what
//! the table stores, the window displays (through the `KEY_*` GlobalStrings), and the files save.
//!
//! A press is matched against them by string equality — and then, on a miss, **once more** with
//! its leftmost modifier dropped ([`Chord::fallback`], decision 1142; this is the half 0585 got
//! wrong and 0997 carried).
//!
//! Prefix order is ALT-CTRL-SHIFT, verified from 1.12's own capture Lua (`Blizzard_BindingUI.lua`
//! prepends SHIFT, then CTRL, then ALT), its saved cache (`CTRL-SHIFT-PAGEDOWN`), and the engine's
//! own emitter (`0x4b6630` walks the `{bitIndex,name}` table at `0x846bd0` downward). It is not
//! only cosmetic: that order is what decides *which* modifier the fallback drops.
//!
//! The Super/Cmd key is **not** a 1.12 binding modifier: a chord never carries it, a super-modified
//! press never matches (0585's `sup` addition), and a capture with Super held is ignored outright.

    //    numpad's Enter folds to.
    // 2. A token this side accepts must be one [`key_token`] would produce, on THIS platform.
    //    Otherwise the two tables drift: on a Mac `F13` is the print-screen key and `F14`/`F15`
    //    are the unbindable ScrollLock/Pause pair, so parsing those strings to their raw
    //    `KeyCode`s would make a chord the capture arm can never write and the window can never
    //    show, reachable only by hand-editing the file. Asking the namer closes it structurally
