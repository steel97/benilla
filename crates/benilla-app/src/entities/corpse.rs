//! **The corpse OBJECT rendered as the dead body** (decision 1706) — the deferral decision 0308 §7
//! opened ("the corpse *object* rendered as the dead body — CGCorpse law") and this closes.
//!
//! A `TYPEID_CORPSE` (7) object is what you run back to: the body a released player leaves behind,
//! and the **bone pile** the server converts it into once it is reclaimed, looted, or times out.
//! Until 1706 it streamed in, spawned an entity, latched its guid for the reclaim send — and drew
//! nothing at all, because [`EntityKind`] had no variant for it and every model lane matched on
//! `Unit | Player | GameObject`.
//!
//! ## The reference's law (`CGCorpse_C` dress `0x5d6260`, model getter `0x5d6700`)
//!
//! It forks once, on `CORPSE_FIELD_FLAGS` bit 0 (`CORPSE_FLAG_BONES`), and the two halves share
//! nothing:
//!
//! - **A fresh body** (`0x5d6297`) allocates a `CCharacterComponent` at `[corpse+0x29c]` and fills
//!   it from the corpse's OWN snapshot — the seven `CORPSE_FIELD_BYTES_1/_2` bytes (`+0x69..+0x6f`)
//!   and the 19 `CORPSE_FIELD_ITEM` slots (`+0x1c + slot*4`, low 24 bits = the ItemDisplayInfo id)
//!   — through the very same compositor entry `0x478cb0` a living player is dressed by. Its model
//!   is `CORPSE_FIELD_DISPLAY_ID` down the ordinary CreatureDisplayInfo → CreatureModelData chain
//!   (`0x5d6759`), which is why the whole character pipeline (decisions 0041/0044/0045/0074) simply
//!   applies: a corpse *is* a player body wearing a wire-supplied look.
//! - **A bone pile** (`0x5d6291 jne`) builds **no component at all** — no appearance, no gear — and
//!   takes its model from race/sex instead: `0x5d670c` formats
//!   `World\Generic\PassiveDoodads\DeathSkeletons\%s%sDeathSkeleton.mdx` from `ChrRaces[race]+0x3c`
//!   (the client fileString: `"Human"`, `"Scourge"`, …) and `["Male","Female","NOSEX"][sex]`. Those
//!   16 shipped models are fully static, two-boned, one hardcoded texture each.
//!
//! Three slots are carved out of the dress loop, and none of them is a "skip if empty":
//! `0x5d6465`/`0x5d6470` skip slot 0 (head) and slot 0xe (back) when this corpse's own
//! `CORPSE_FLAG_HIDE_HELM 0x08` / `HIDE_CLOAK 0x10` are set — its own bits on its own field, and the
//! opposite instruction polarity to the player lane (wow-re `helm-cloak-hide.md` §2b) — and
//! `0x5d644e` skips slot 0x11 (ranged) unconditionally.
//!
//! ## What a corpse deliberately does NOT wear
//!
//! **No weapons.** Slots 0xf/0x10 detour at `0x5d645a`/`0x5d645f` to `0x5d649b`, which pushes the
//! raw `CORPSE_FIELD_ITEM` word as a **guid** into the object-manager lookup `0x468460` with
//! typemask 2 (`TYPEMASK_ITEM`) and skips the slot on the null return. That word is
//! `DisplayInfoID | (InventoryType << 24)` — never a guid — so the lookup cannot succeed and the
//! branch is dead. We reproduce the *outcome* (a corpse wears armour, not weapons), not the
//! mechanism: aping a dead lookup would be aping a quirk, which §3 of the contract is against.
//!
//! ## The ground decal, and the one divergence
//!
//! `[corpse+0x2b0]` is **not** a render scale (its old ledger gloss); it is `0.5 ×` the MD20 render
//! bounding-sphere radius, read by exactly one site — `0x5d6fe0`, which sizes the corpse's
//! `UnitSelectTexture` ground decal by it × `OBJECT_FIELD_SCALE_X`.
//!
//! **That decal is dead code, and we owe it nothing** (1727, closed by 1732). Its one dispatcher
//! image-wide gates on the object being the **Locked Target** (`[0xb4e2d8]`/`[0xb4e2dc]`), and
//! `SetSelection 0x493540` refuses any object whose `[vt+0x58]` selectability slot returns 0 —
//! CGCorpse's is `0x469fe0`, literally `33 c0 c3`. No corpse, bones or fresh, can ever be the
//! locked target, so `0x5d6fe0` never runs. (The same refusal is independently why a click on a
//! body leaves your current target alone: `0x4935f3` bails *before* the clear-the-old-selection
//! call.) Mouseover is a different slot — `+0x54` = `0x5d76d0`, which a corpse *does* pass — and
//! that is the highlight/cursor/tooltip route we ship, not a ring.
//!
//! **The divergence to know about** (flagged open by wow-re's §5, not settled at the bytes): the
//! reference computes the drowned verdict *inside* the create, from the scene node's cached liquid
//! probe — and its own `[node+0x90] & 0x20` gate means an un-probed node falls through to `Dead`.
//! Whether the node is already probed that early is a byte question nobody has closed. Ours asks
//! the world directly at attach time, a frame or more later, so our `Drowned` leg is reachable
//! whether or not theirs is. The failure is one-sided — we can only ever show `Drowned` where the
//! reference might show `Dead`, never the reverse — and it needs a drowned corpse to observe.
//!
//! ## The pose
//!
//! `0x5d63de`/`0x5d6402` arm bone 0 through the shared M2 arm `0x7121a0` with **AnimationData id 6
//! (`Dead`)**, or **132 (`Drowned`)** when `0x5d6540` says so — all of it byte-VERIFIED by wow-re's
//! §5 round (`object-layer/scratch/corpse-drowned-pose.md`, 2026-08-29, commissioned by this work).
//! That predicate is a **liquid** query: `0x670630` reads the corpse scene node's cached probe,
//! whose `[node+0x98]` is named at its *writer* (`0x69e280` → terrain's own bit-exact
//! `liquid_status`) as the **liquid surface height**. The comparison is
//!
//! ```text
//! liquidSurfaceZ − CORPSE_FIELD_POS_Z > [0x80abfc]        // 0x3f2aaaab = 0.66666669
//! ```
//!
//! strict (`test ah,0x41` read by `jne`, so equality and NaN are both false), and 2/3 yd is this
//! client's submersion depth generally — `0x60a740`, whose result is pushed as the `$FSD` **wading**
//! flag, runs the same subtraction against the same constant.
//!
//! Both ids resolve through the model's own fallback table before playing (which is what
//! `0x7121a0` itself does: `0x711c10` playableAnimationLookup, then `0x712470` animationLookup,
//! before any `nSequences` bounds check): `HumanMale.m2` authors neither 6 nor 132's head directly,
//! and `AnimationData.dbc` walks `Dead → Death(1)` and `Drowned → Drown(131)`.
//!
//! The clip is armed **once, seeked to its end**, which is the reference's own shape: `0x5d6260`
//! runs exactly once per object (one call site, no data-section pointer to it anywhere in the PE),
//! it caches the verdict in `[corpse+0x2ac]`, and nothing ever recomputes it. `0x5d6850` re-arms
//! from that cached byte, but it is the **model-ready callback** (vtable `+0x34`, fired by the
//! trampoline `0x613d70` that SetModel registers), not a per-frame tick. A corpse object never
//! collapses in front of you either — it is created after the release, already lying down — so this
//! is a settled pose, never a replay.
