//! **Item / enchant glow effects** (decision 0805): the permanent weapon glow a display authors,
//! and the enchant glow a weapon's enchant carries — `Spells\Enchantments\*.mdx` effect models
//! hung on the ITEM's own model, not on the wearer's body.
//!
//! ## The chain, and where each half is verified
//!
//! `ItemDisplayInfo` col 22 → `ItemVisuals` → 5 × `ItemVisualEffects` → a glow `.mdx` per slot
//! ([`benilla_formats::ItemVisualCatalog`], whose module doc owns the table shapes and the
//! reference's per-slot skip rules). Two sources feed the id, and the reference resolves exactly
//! one of them per item (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/item-visual-enchant.md`, byte-verified;
//! the call sites below were read at the bytes for decision 0805):
//!
//! - **Intrinsic** — the display's own id, passed by the character's held-item attach:
//!   `0x47a200: mov edx,[esi+0x58]` → `0x4798c0(…, itemVisualsId)`, which calls the attach
//!   `0x479700` iff the id is **`> 0`** (`jle` skip). The same primitive attaches the helm (id
//!   11), the shoulders (5/6) and the quiver (26) — and **every one of those call sites pushes a
//!   literal `0`**, so on a character body only the WEAPON/SHIELD hand attach can glow. The
//!   ranged-ammo lane (`0x479f40`) passes `[ebx+0x58]` at its tail, so a thrown/ammo model glows
//!   from its own display too.
//! - **Enchant** — `0x5eed50` per weapon slot → `0x62ec70(item)`: if the base display's
//!   ItemVisuals row **exists**, it returns `-1` and the enchant glow is suppressed (the base
//!   already draws one); otherwise the first of the item's 7 enchant slots whose
//!   `SpellItemEnchantment` row carries a nonzero visual wins. [`effective_visual`] is that fork.
//!
//! ## Where the glow hangs
//!
//! `0x479700` walks the 5 effect columns and calls `0x712f70(glow, itemModel, attachId = the
//! column index)` — so **slot i is M2 attachment id i on the item's own model**, and a row that
//! repeats one effect across all five slots (BlueGlow_Med ×5, the common shape) reads as a glow
//! along the whole blade.
//!
//! **How many of the five actually land is the model's business, and it varies**: of the 160
//! distinct weapon models the 360 glowing displays resolve to, 61 author the full ids 0..4 and 44
//! author only 2/3/4 (Ironfoe's hammer is one — three of its five copies draw). An id the model
//! doesn't author hangs nothing at all, byte-verified: `0x712f70` stores `0x710310`'s `0xffff`
//! miss and every consumer of that field (`0x7140aa`, `0x718668`, `0x719266`) tests
//! `cmp 0xffff; je` and skips the child — there is no fallback to the model origin. Which record
//! an id resolves to is the model's **AttachLookup**, never a scan of its table
//! (`benilla_m2::M2Model::attachment`): ~5% of weapon models author two records under one id.
//!
//! An item model poses at rest (no rig is spawned for it — `super::equipment`), so the attach
//! point is its bind-pose position ([`crate::portrait::attachment_point`]) and the glow instance
//! is a plain child of the item root: it rides the hand/hip/back bone with the weapon, and dies
//! with it on a gear or sheath change. Everything past that — the effect model's own rig,
//! emitters, ribbons, material animation — is the shared effect body
//! ([`super::spell_fx::attach_effect_visuals`]); these models are almost all pure particle
//! emitters (BlueGlow_Med: zero render batches, one Plane/Add emitter on `Flare.blp`).
