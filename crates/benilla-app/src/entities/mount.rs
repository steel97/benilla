//! Mounts (decisions 0441 / this session's re-seat): the projection from
//! `UNIT_FIELD_MOUNTDISPLAYID` — the wire's one mounted signal — to a second creature visual under
//! the unit. The mount is a child entity carrying a plain creature `NetEntity`, built by the
//! ordinary attach path; the rider's rig re-roots under the mount's attachment-0 seat joint (the
//! `0x60ce70` present-test law); the rider's base pins to Mount(91) while the mount child
//! locomotes through the untouched gait driver, fed the host's own movement view
//! ([`crate::creature_anim`]'s host-view redirect). This module owns the transition.
//!
//! ## The transition is a RE-SEAT, not a rebuild (B199)
//!
//! **VERIFIED** — wow-re `mount-composition.md` Q3/Q4, byte-cited: the change handler `0x5ffa50`
//! runs *teardown old, then build new*, and neither half touches the rider's own model.
//!
//! - **Mount up, `0x607a00`:** load the mount M2 → `0x613d80 SetMountModel` into `CGUnit+0xdc` →
//!   `0x712f70 CM2Model::attachChild(this = BODY [+0xd8], parent = MOUNT, slot 0)`, which sets
//!   `body+0x1cc = mount` and links the body into the mount's child list. The **body model is
//!   re-parented, not re-created**; its world matrix is recomposed each frame from the mount's live
//!   posed attachment-0 bone (`m2_animate`'s child recursion `0x718657`–`0x71876f`).
//! - **Dismount, `0x607ce0`:** `0x713020` **detaches** the body, `0x613d80(0)` destroys the mount
//!   model, the body goes to op4 seq 0 (Stand). Instant, no transition anim — and again the body
//!   model itself is untouched.
//!
//! benilla used to answer the same field change with a **full teardown** of the rider's visual
//! (`despawn_related::<Children>()` + a strip of the rig, the player, the driver, the attach table)
//! and let `attach_entity_visuals` rebuild it — the shape 0835 removed from gear changes for the
//! same reason it is wrong here. Everything hanging off the rider died with it, and the one class
//! that never came back was the **persistent aura kit instance**: `FxAttached` lives on the *unit*,
//! survived the teardown holding a dangling root, and `attach_spell_fx`'s spawn gate is
//! `root.is_some()` — so a mage's Ice Barrier glow was destroyed on mount-up and never re-attached,
//! not even on dismount (the aura watcher is edge-driven off the slot set, and the aura never left
//! it). That is B199, and 0835 named exactly this teardown as the surviving source.
//!
//! So the transition now moves the rig's **consumer anchors** — the only children the rig's model
//! frame owns (decision 0724) — from the unit's own frame onto the seat anchor and back, and
//! re-points [`RigPose::joints_root`]. Skinned parts render purely from the palette and never move;
//! held items, spell-effect instances and overhead riders hang off the anchors and ride along, so
//! nothing on the rider is destroyed, re-created, re-composited or re-faded by mounting.
