//! WMO-display GameObject doodad props — the ship's sails.
//!
//! A WMO's placed doodads (MODD — for the two 1.12 transports: the entire sail rig
//! `TRANSPORTSHIP_SAILS.MDX`, the zeppelin's rotor `ZEPANIMATION.MDX`, and the cabin furniture)
//! are M2 props the terrain path spawns for world-placed buildings but the gameobject path never
//! did, so ships sailed bare (director, 2026-07-17). A gameobject carries no MODF placement, so
//! there is no selected extra set: its props are doodad set 0 (`Set_$DefaultGlobal`, the
//! always-shown set) alone — and both transport WMOs author exactly one set (verified from the
//! extracted roots: ship 134 props / zeppelin 1, all in set 0).
//!
//! Each prop spawns through the shared placed-model assembler
//! ([`benilla_world::terrain_stream::spawn_model_entities`]) with its doodad-LOCAL transform, and the
//! result is parented under the streamed gameobject entity: transform propagation carries the
//! props with the moving boat, the entity's despawn cascades through them, and the transport's
//! off-map hide (`Visibility` on the root) is inherited. The animated props (sails, rotors) get
//! the ordinary doodad anim host — its joint/billboard/fade consumers all read propagated
//! `GlobalTransform`s, so riding a moving parent needs nothing special. A boneless prop's glow
//! card FOLLOWS an anchor child instead of baking a world pivot (`BillboardCard::following`).
//!
//! A prop with an authored collision hull is SOLID (0470): its collider spawns as a body-less
//! child, which avian attaches to the nearest `RigidBody` ancestor — the transport's kinematic
//! body — so the cargo's collision sails with the deck (the same collide-iff-hull law as world
//! placements; hull-less furniture stays walk-through, exactly like the reference). The mover's
//! ride-attach walks the support's parent chain, so standing on a crate is standing on the boat.
//!
//! The prop's live dressing (0474, closing the 0458 gaps) takes the ENTITY-owned shape, not the
//! terrain path's world-baked one:
//! - **Emitters** (the deck lanterns' flames) spawn with `owner` = the emitter's host-bone joint
//!   (or the prop's root submesh for a boneless model) and `anchor` = the prop root — the sim
//!   refreshes the placement from the owner's propagated `GlobalTransform` every frame and the
//!   risen cloud re-anchors to the prop's live position (the reference's per-frame
//!   `translate(−emitterPos)` draw-matrix rebuild: a moving model carries its flame). No
//!   [`benilla_world::particles::EmitterFade`] — that gate's centre is a baked world point, and a mover has
//!   none. The emitter entity parents under the gameobject, so the off-map hide reaches it and
//!   despawn cascades.
//!   ⚠ **This used to say the population is "bounded by server visibility instead". That was
//!   wrong, and a transport is the exact counter-example** (decision 0678, bug B39): vmangos
//!   streams transports **map-wide**, so a ship's deck lanterns are resident from anywhere on the
//!   map. Measured from Durotar: 56 emitters ticking and drawing at 4853–7080 yd, this boat's
//!   lanterns among them. The bound is now the far-clip wall, applied in
//!   [`benilla_world::particles`]' sim to every world-lane emitter regardless of `EmitterFade`.
//! - **M2 point lights** (the lantern's glow source) spawn as CHILDREN at the prop-local
//!   position — propagation carries the source with the hull, and the hide/despawn follow.
//! - **Interior cabin props** (an INDOOR-group MODD — ~118 of the ship's 133) take the interior
//!   SH-probe lane, folded ONCE through the host's spawn pose. Fold-once stays exact on a mover:
//!   the ambient word is directionless, the diffuse lobe rides the FIXED world axis (byte law —
//!   it never turns with the model), and a MOLR lobe's gain is a pure relative distance. Every
//!   1.12 transport WMO authors ZERO MOLT lights (verified from the four extracted roots), so
//!   there is no frozen-lobe-direction residual either; a future MOLR-authored mover would
//!   freeze its lobe directions at spawn — a noted residual, not worth live-refold machinery.
