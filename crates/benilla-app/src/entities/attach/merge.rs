//! **A body's batches, merged by material** — one mesh entity per *material group* of a dressed
//! body instead of one per authored M2 batch (decision 1940, the crowd rig's first proposal).
//!
//! A geared level-60 body stands as 12–27 mesh parts binding 5–16 distinct materials (the dress
//! census's `parts=`/`mats=`, read off a 40-man raid at the Stormwind auction house): the skin
//! composite serves the torso, arms, legs, hands and feet as separate opaque batches, the hair
//! texture serves the hair and the facial geosets, and every one of those was its own entity —
//! its own row in every per-entity sweep Bevy and we run each frame (bounds, specialization,
//! visibility, extraction, the material walk), its own phase item, its own draw with its own
//! bind-group and vertex-buffer sets in wgpu's pass encoder. The raid's cost is that population,
//! not a hot function (1929), and per body about 40 % of it is batches that draw with a material
//! the batch beside it already binds.
//!
//! **What merges.** Two visible batches of one body join when they would be *indistinguishable*
//! to everything downstream of the spawn: the same six-handle material set (steady, the two
//! interior lanes, the fade twins, the depth-prime twin — every component derived from them is
//! then identical), the same blend/sidedness, both static or both skinned, and neither carrying
//! per-batch state the merge cannot represent: an animated alpha track, a billboard, a welded
//! billboard seam, a ground-decal quad. Transparent batches never meet — their material key
//! carries the authored batch order (`model_render::MatKey::batch_order`), so each has its own
//! handle by construction and painter's order is untouched. The key is *static*: which slot a
//! batch's texture comes from and its authored flags, never the texture itself — so a gear change
//! that swaps the composite re-points a group's material in place exactly as it re-pointed a
//! part's, and only a change to the *visible set* (a geoset the new gear hides or reveals)
//! rebuilds the groups it touches.
//!
//! **What a group is.** A synthetic [`EntityPart`] cloned from its first member, with the
//! geometry replaced by the members' concatenation and the render forms built from it the way
//! `model_forms` builds a batch's — the static form `RENDER_WORLD`-only, the skinned twin keeping
//! its main-world copy for the picker (0834's contract, unchanged). The concatenated
//! [`RenderSubmesh`] is also the group's [`PickMesh`], so the mouseover ray still tests the
//! resident geometry it always did. Merged forms are cached per (model geometry, member set):
//! forty humans in the same gear silhouette share them the way they shared the per-batch forms.
//!
//! Attach models (helm, shoulders, held items) are their own M2s with their own roots and are not
//! in scope here; a body's billboard cards keep their own spawner (`dress::spawn_billboard_part`).
