//! The **tuple-driven character preview** builder (decisions 0423 + 0465, widened by 1060) — the
//! entities-side half of every booth that shows a character nobody is standing in. It lives under
//! `attach` so it can reuse the character body pipeline directly
//! (`char_skin::build_char_skin_materials`, the geoset filter, the [`super::super::EntityPart`]
//! source, the item-display models) without widening any of it.
//!
//! Two callers, **one assembly** ([`assemble`]). Each reduces its own look to the same
//! [`PreviewSpec`] — body displayId + the five appearance dials + an enum-shaped
//! `[CharEnumItem; 19]` — and gets back the flat part/rider/effect lists its booth bakes:
//!
//! - **The glue screens** ([`build_glue_preview`]): a **Select** look carries its roster record
//!   verbatim; a **Create** look resolves the (race, class, sex) starting outfit (CharStartOutfit,
//!   decision 0527) into that array — so the create preview is geared exactly like a select body
//!   (the ref's create screen dresses the model, not the underwear-only body decision 0423 assumed).
//! - **The dressing room** ([`build_dressup_preview`], decision 1060): the *live player's* own body
//!   and appearance, wearing their own visible items with the tried-on ones substituted in. That
//!   substitution is the whole feature, and it is why the dressing room cannot mirror a world
//!   entity's spawned children the way the paper doll does (`portrait::sync_body_booth`) — nobody
//!   in the world is wearing the item being previewed.
//!
//! The assembly is the world's own way — displayId → the shared [`Creatures`] display cache →
//! geoset filter → the composited body over a hand-built [`CharLook`] — plus the armor-region
//! composite + real equipment geosets, the cloak, and the attach riders: helm (per-race/sex model,
//! hide-helm honored), shoulders, and the weapons **held in the hands** (the byte-verified select
//! build — wow-re `glue-select-model.md`, folded back over 0465's sheathed INTERIM). The portrait
//! module's `sync_glue_booth` / `sync_dressup_booth` then re-light and bake them (they own the
//! *booth*; this owns the *assembly*). A glue body's displayId is added to
//! `update_display_models`'s want-list (in [`super::super`]) so its model builds with no wire
//! entity — the dressing room's is the player's own, already built; item models register through
//! the same [`ItemDisplays`] want the world path uses.
