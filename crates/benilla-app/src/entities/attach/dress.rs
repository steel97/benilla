//! **Dressing** a unit's model parts — the per-batch spawn [`super::attach_entity_visuals`] runs
//! once per visual, factored out so the **re-dress** ([`super::redress`]) can run the identical law

//!
//! The reference never rebuilds a character to change what it is wearing: the composite atlas is
//! re-blitted into the component's own 256² target and the geosets are re-selected on the SAME
//! `CM2Model` (its per-instance visibility array `+0x98`, whose only writer is the character
//! compositor — wow-re `charactermodel.md` "Assembly orchestration" + `models.md`
//! §"geoset-visibility-default"). Its attachments — held items, the helm, the shoulders and
//! everything hanging off them — are never touched by that path at all. This module is the half of
//! that law that concerns one part: which materials it draws through, and how it is born.
