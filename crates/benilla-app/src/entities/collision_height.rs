/// splash fires at `0.4·h`, wading ends where swimming begins (`0.75·h`), and the foam gate is
/// `max(2·h, 1.0)`. Each of those *fractions* is byte-verified against the real client (wow-re
/// `swim-transition.md`, `swim-mechanism.md`, `water-ripple-decal.md`); until decision 0645 the
/// `h` they multiplied was a **constant** — [`crate::player::DEFAULT_COLLISION_HEIGHT`], the
/// client's own empty-world ctor default — so all five lines were right for a human male (2.031,
/// within 2 mm of it) and wrong for every other race. A gnome female stands 1.15 yd and was held
/// 1.52 yd under: she could not reach the surface, which is how the defect finally showed (B76).
///
/// `CreatureModelData.collisionHeight × k`. The column is the model's own MD20 collision-box Z
/// extent in raw model units — machine-pinned against the shipped client (`benilla_formats`
/// `collision_height_is_the_m2_collision_box`), which is what settles that it scales with the
/// geometry it bounds.
///
/// **`k = max(OBJECT_FIELD_SCALE_X, CreatureDisplayInfo.creatureModelScale)`** — VERIFIED byte law
/// (wow-re `collision/scratch/mover-collision-scalars.md`): `0x60b270` fetches `SCALE_X` through
/// vtable slot `+0x1c` (`0x469f10`), compares it against the display row's own column at
/// `0x60b312` (`CreatureDisplayInfo+0x10`), and hands the **larger** to `0x6174b0`, which stores
/// `CollisionHeight · k` into `CMovement+0xb4` at `0x617501`. Its two callers include the unit
/// model (re)build `0x5fb9dd` with `force = 1`, so every unit gets it, not just the mover.
///
/// The `max` is a **floor, never a second multiplier**. The *render* scale is [`NetEntity::scale`]
/// = `OBJECT_FIELD_SCALE_X` alone, which the server has already folded the DBC scales into
/// (`CreatureModelData.modelScale × CreatureDisplayInfo.scale`, vmangos `Unit::GetScaleForDisplayId`
/// — and wow-re `object-layer.md`'s render-scale CORRECTION says in as many words that a client
/// multiplying the display column in again would *square* it). So the collision box and the drawn
/// body still cannot disagree; the floor only stops the box shrinking below the display's own size.
///
/// **At rest the floor is inert, which is why its absence hid**: not one of the 430 shipped
/// `CreatureModelData` rows scales below 1.0, so the folded `SCALE_X ≥ CreatureDisplayInfo.scale`
/// always and `max` picks `SCALE_X`. It bites exactly where `SCALE_X` drops *below* the display's
/// column — a shrink aura, and the **390** `creature_template` rows on our own server whose
/// `display_scale` override undercuts it (by up to 6×). Those units swam at a fraction of their
/// real depth. The floor can only ever *raise* `h`, so no unit that swims correctly today stops.
///
/// **The display it is derived from is the unit's NATIVE one** — `UNIT_FIELD_NATIVEDISPLAYID`, not
/// the one being rendered. `0x60b270` fetches its `CreatureDisplayInfo` row at
/// `[unit+0x110]+0x1f8` (index 132), while its sibling `0x60ae10` reads `+0x1f4` (index 131 =
/// `UNIT_FIELD_DISPLAYID`) off the same array; the cached-row arm is taken only when the two
/// fields are equal (`[unit+0xc58] & 0x100` = "not transformed", set from their equality at
/// `0x60b166`), so **every arm yields the native model's row**. VERIFIED — wow-re
/// `mover-collision-scalars.md` and `remote-swim-decision.md` §4.
///
/// So **a transform does not resize the collision prism**: a druid in bear form keeps the druid's
/// swim, splash, foam and wade lines; a GM `.modify morph` into a gnome keeps the human's. That is
/// the reference deliberately letting the collision box and the drawn body disagree — and nothing
/// here needs them to agree, because every consumer of this number is a *depth line* (a fraction of
/// `h`), never a rendered size. Decision 0695 restamped it from the rendered display on the
/// opposite premise ("the collision box and the drawn body can never disagree"); 1574 corrects that.
///
/// **Not** the movement capsule: that stays the constant-height tunable it has always been
/// ([`crate::player::CAPSULE_HEIGHT`] — see its doc for why the two are deliberately separate).
