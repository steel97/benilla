//! Equipment visuals (decisions 0072/0074): held items (weapons, shields, ranged), worn-armor
//! resolution, and helm/shoulder attach models on units' bodies.
//!
//! Two halves, both per-frame systems chained after [`super::attach_entity_visuals`]:
//!
//! - **Resolution** ([`resolve_equipment`]) — what should each unit hold, and where? A **creature**
//!   carries its item **display ids directly** in `UNIT_VIRTUAL_ITEM_SLOT_DISPLAY` (+ class/invType and
//!   a per-item sheath type in `UNIT_VIRTUAL_ITEM_INFO`) — no lookup. A **player** exposes only item
//!   *entries* (`PLAYER_VISIBLE_ITEM_*`); the display id / inventory type / sheath type come from the
//!   item template, resolved through the ask-once item layer ([`crate::items::Items`], `CMSG_ITEM_QUERY_SINGLE` on
//!   miss — the real client's ItemCache does exactly this; other players' inventory GUIDs are
//!   server-private, so the visible-item entry is the *only* path). Drawn-vs-stowed placement follows
//!   the unit's sheath state (`UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_2` byte 0) + the item's sheath type.
//! - **Attach** ([`attach_held_items`]) — spawn each resolved item's model as a child of the body's
//!   **attach-point joint entity** (via [`BoneAttach`], inserted by the visual attach), so it rides the
//!   hand/hip/back bone through every animation — the modern analogue of the client's attach-transform
//!   install (`0x47a380`, wow-re charactermodel). The item model itself is a static mesh: its origin
//!   *is* the grip, aligned by the attach bone's animated frame.
//!
//! Item models cache per **item display id** in [`ItemDisplays`] (a [`DisplayModel`] like creatures/
//! GameObjects use, resolved from `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc` into `Item\ObjectComponents\{Weapon,Shield}\`),
//! with the display's model texture bound to the model's runtime type-2 batches
//! ([`CharSkinSlot::Object`]).
//!
//! Three files, along the same seam the doc above describes: **`resolve`** (what should each unit
//! hold, and where — the descriptor read + the placement law), **`spawn`** (the sub-model children
//! that ride the bones), and this module, which owns what both share — the attach-id table, the
//! display cache, and the components they diff through.
