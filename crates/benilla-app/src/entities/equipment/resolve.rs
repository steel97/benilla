///   the helm's attach model, its RF-0083 hide-masks, the cloak's geoset and cape texture — follows
///   for free.
/// - slots 15/16/17 (mainhand, offhand, ranged) — **always**. Ranged is skipped outright
///   (`0x5d644e`); the two weapon slots take a branch that looks up the packed item word as an
