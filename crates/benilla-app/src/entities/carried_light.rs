//! **Carried M2 lights** — the dynamic point lights an *entity* brings into the world, as opposed to
//! the ones a placed ADT doodad / WMO prop brings (`crate::terrain_stream`'s `spawn_lights_for`).
//!
//! The law is one law. `0x718960` runs per frame over **every** CM2Model the scene draws — a placed
//! doodad, a creature, a GameObject, and (recursing at `7191b9`/`719286`) each attached child model —
//! gathers that model's own `type==1` light blocks, transforms each def position by its **live bone
//! matrix**, and registers the result into the world scene's light DB (`0x71b650` → `0x71bb60`). Every
//! lit surface then selects its ≤3 nearest from that same DB (decisions 0016/0273/0285). Nothing in the
//! chain distinguishes "prop" from "unit": a torch is a torch whether it is staked in the ground or
//! held in a hand.
//!
//! benilla had implemented only the placed half, so a torch-bearing NPC carried a flame that lit
//! nothing — the director's report from Westfall (Remy "Two Times", whose `Club_1H_Torch_A_01.m2`
//! authors exactly one warm point light) is the reference doing the other half: the fence rails and
//! the grass around him light up.
//!
//! **The bone ride is the whole reason this isn't just the placed spawner again.** A placed prop's
//! light bone never moves, so the rest pose is exact and the light can be baked to a world point. An
//! entity's does move — the hand swings — so each light is spawned as a **child of its host bone's
//! joint entity** with the def position rebased into that bone's frame (`position − bone_pivot`),
//! exactly as the emitters and ribbons ride (0130 phase 4). Bevy's transform propagation then walks
//! the light through the animation for free, and the per-frame light packer
//! ([`crate::lighting`]) reads its `GlobalTransform` like any other point light.
