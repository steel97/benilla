//! Spell-visual **effect models** (decision 0099 phase 3): the attach-point `.mdx` glows a
//! spell-visual kit hangs on a casting unit — Fireball's burning hands, a heal's golden sparkle.
//! The **lootable-corpse sparkle** rides the same plumbing (the client hangs it on the same
//! `Effect_C` node type): `creature_anim::spell_visual::arm_loot_fx` writes its Begin/Reap edges
//! under a reserved key.
//!
//! The router (`crate::creature_anim::spell_visual::route_cast_visuals`) resolves each cast edge's
//! kit to `(M2 attachment id, model path)` pairs and emits [`SpellKitFx`] edges; this module owns
//! the render side: a path-keyed [`DisplayModel`] cache (the held-items pattern — entries created
//! here, parts built by `super::update_display_models` once the M2 loads), and per-unit effect
//! instances spawned under the unit's [`BoneAttach`] joints so they ride the animating bone —
//! exactly the client's `CEffect` bone attach, re-resolved per frame off the live bone matrix
//! (wow-re `spell-visual-apply.md` §1.5/§5; riding the joint entity gives us the same for free).
//!
//! Lifetime is the client's stage policy (decision 0107 verdict 2): a **persistent** instance
//! (precast/channel) lives until its spell-id-keyed [`SpellKitFx::Reap`] (the client's
//! `0x614150`); a **self-terminating** one (cast release, kit push) despawns after one pass of
//! its model's sequence 0 — the stage-0/1 completion callback's clock, which runs whether or not
//! the sequence moves a bone (the eat/drink tankard is a 6.667 s sequence with zero bone keys;
//! against the ~5 s kit-resend cadence its instances overlap into a continuously held jug). The
//! attach cascade for a model lacking the requested point is the client's: tag → `0xf` → `0x13`
//! → the unit's base (wow-re §5, `0x61ceb0`).
//!
//! Effect models run their **bone rigs** ([`arm_effect_rig`] — the birth clip + global sequences
//! pose the joints that meshes skin to and emitters/ribbons/cards ride), advance them through the
//! authored `Stand` → `Hold` → `Decay` lifecycle ([`lifecycle`], which is where the Ice Barrier
//! shield's pulse comes from), and run their **material
//! animation**: each part's colour-alpha × transparency-weight loops sample per instance on the
//! attach clock (a [`MatAnim`](benilla_world::doodad_anim::MatAnim) that owns the part's render-alpha
//! tag — Battle Shout's staggered crescent pulses), and an animated M2Color RGB ticks a
//! **per-instance material clone**'s tint uniform ([`FxTintAnims`] — the white-hot flash cooling
//! to red; per instance because one cast = one phase, unlike the doodad lane's shared-clock
//! loops in [`benilla_world::doodad_anim::TintAnimMaterials`]).
//!
//! Effect instances **fire their model's event track** ([`fire_fx_anim_events`], decision 0304):
//! the playing clip's `$SND`-family keyframes emit the same [`AnimSoundEvent`] stream creatures
//! emit (spatialized at the host unit), so an effect whose sound lives in its own M2 — the
//! level-up pillar's `$SND(888)` at t=0.033s — rings without any code-side kit. (The ding's
//! WATCHER — the `UNIT_FIELD_LEVEL` edge that spawns the pillar — lives with its lootable-edge
//! sibling in `creature_anim::spell_visual::arm_level_up_fx`, the SpellKitFx writers' home.)
//!
//! Approximations, named: the UV-scroll channel still doesn't run here (0130's scope was placed
//! doodads); the span-based self-termination stands in for the client's model-event completion
//! callback; and the kit sound keeps playing unconditionally where the client gates it on
//! no-visual-attached.
