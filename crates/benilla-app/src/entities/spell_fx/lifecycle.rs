//! The effect-model **animation lifecycle**: `Stand` → `Hold` → `Decay`, the state machine a
//! spell-visual `CEffect`'s attached model runs for as long as it lives (VERIFIED — wow-re
//! `ceffect-anim-lifecycle.md`, §5 trio + corpus census 2026-08-02). Split from [`super`] along the
//! concern seam: that file owns the *instances* (the model cache, the attach cascade, the reap, the
//! world plants); this one owns *what they play*.
//!
//! ## The mechanism
//!
//! A `CEffect`'s model is armed **by `AnimationData.dbc` id, never by file order**. The model-load
//! bootstrap (`0x710153`–`0x71019b`) arms **id 0 `Stand`, variation 0** — the *birth*
//! ([`benilla_assets::ModelAnimations::preferred_clip`] is that resolve). When the armed sequence's
//! authored span elapses, the CM2 Advance `0x719370` latches once (`block+0xc0`) and enqueues the
//! model's registered completion callback; the scene tick drains it at `0x707595` at the **end of
//! the same tick**, passing **the id that just completed** as its first argument. `Which` callback
//! is registered is chosen by `PlaySpellVisualKit 0x60edf0` **per stage** — that table is
//! [`FxStage`], and this module is its three arms:
//!
//! - **[`FxStage::OneShot`]** (stages 0/1, `0x5fbf50`) — destroy at the first completion. Modelled
//!   by the instance's own span clock in [`super::attach_spell_fx`], so nothing here watches it.
//! - **[`FxStage::State`]** (stage 2, `0x5ff170`) — iff the model authors **`Hold` (158)**, arm it
//!   and keep it running for the effect's whole life; if it does not, do **nothing at all** (no
//!   destroy, no re-loop — the model simply stays parked on its birth sequence). The reference's
//!   "keep running" is a literal re-arm every span by `0x5ff1d0`, gated on a deadline at
//!   `node+0x58` that is **nonzero only at stage 3** — so for an aura state or a channel it never
//!   fires and Hold repeats forever. **This is Ice Barrier's pulse.**
//! - **[`FxStage::Relive`]** (stages 3/4, `0x60ed00`) — re-arm **the id that just completed**,
//!   forever, with no `Hold` lookup, no deadline and no destroy. A precast whose birth sequence
//!   clamps therefore still repeats it.
//!
//! Reap ([`FxDecay`]) is the same shape from the other end (`0x614150` → `0x6141c0`): if the model
//! authors **`Decay` (159)**, arm it and the instance **keeps rendering for that sequence's
//! authored span** before it despawns; otherwise it goes immediately. `0x6203e0` — the destructor —
//! plays nothing itself (its `0x4` bit is owner-attachment teardown, not a decay-out; wow-re §8
//! corrects `ceffect-selfterm.md` on exactly this).
//!
//! ## What this replaces, and how wrong it was
//!
//! Every effect instance used to arm **one** clip for its whole life — the model's *file-order-first*
//! sequence, repeated only if that sequence's own loop flag was clear. For `Spells\IceShield_State`
//! (Ice Barrier's state kit) that is the 0.70 s clamping birth, so the shield grew in and then held
//! its last frame for the aura's entire duration. `benilla-extract fxlifescan` sizes the class:
//! **163 of 9691 models author a `Hold`/`Decay` leg** (158 of them under `Spells\`), **116 of which
//! froze** exactly this way — Mana Shield, Lightning Shield, Divine Shield, Frost Nova, the Fire and
//! Frost Wards, Immolate, Net, the healing auras.
//!
//! ## Named divergences
//!
//! - The reference re-arms `Hold` with variation `-1` (a `_rand`-weighted walk of the alias chain),
//!   so a model authoring several `Hold` variations could pick a different one each pass. We run one
//!   repeating play instead. Corpus: of the 692 `Spells\` models, 507 have a single sequence, 119
//!   two, 65 three and **one** has four or more — so a multi-variation `Hold` is at most that single
//!   model, and it is not worth a per-pass re-roll's complexity until one shows.
//! - A **ribbon**'s per-sequence visibility is still decided once at spawn ([`crate::ribbons`],
//!   which spawns per fixed-sequence entity). A trail authored dark in `Stand` and lit in `Hold`
//!   would stay dark. Left as a residual: the ribbon lane's own spawn shape has to change for it,
//!   and no reported effect turns on it.
