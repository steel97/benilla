//! Spell **chain beams** — Chain Lightning's arcs, Drain Life's rope of soul, Mind Flay's mana
//! beam, Chain Heal's arc, C'Thun's eye beam (decision 0955, slice 2: the renderer).
//!
//! A kit whose `CharProc` decodes to a chain ([`benilla_formats::ChainProc`]) draws a **polyline of
//! hops** — `caster → t1 → t2 → t3` — with one ribbon per hop, each subdivided, jittered per frame
//! and scrolled. The data half (the DBC row, the sentinel fix, the wire) is slice 1; this module is
//! the client's `LightningObject` (`0x6ec460`) + `CLightning` (`0x7af9b0`/`0x7afcb0`) pair, whose
//! every load-bearing number is byte-VERIFIED in wow-re `system/spell/scratch/chain-beam-law.md`
//! (their `31715619`).
//!
//! ## What the reference does, and what this transcribes
//!
//! **The hop list is unit state, not packet state.** The reference parks it on the caster (the
//! growable array at `unit+0xd44`) — [`ChainHops`] here — filled by **two** producers, `SMSG_SPELL_GO`'s
//! hit list (`0x6e800d`) and `SMSG_SPELL_UPDATE_CHAIN_TARGETS` (`0x605767`), both dropping the
//! caster's own guid, and **consumed exactly once** by the next chain proc (`0x60db72` zeroes the
//! count on every exit path, including the ones that draw nothing).
//!
//! **Target selection** (`0x60dad4`–`0x60db19`): when the playing kit's spell **is** the unit's
//! `UNIT_CHANNEL_SPELL`, its `UNIT_FIELD_CHANNEL_OBJECT` is set, and the hop count is `<= 1`, the
//! beam runs to that single channel object; otherwise it runs the hop array, and an **empty array
//! draws nothing at all**.
//!
//! **Per hop** (`Bolt[i] = (i, i+1)`, `0x6ec980`): a window `[t0 + i × stagger, + life)` — so a
//! 3-hop Chain Lightning arcs *outward* — and the whole beam expires at `t0 + hops × life`. The
//! **flag** ([`ChainProc::flag`], the decoded `CharParamTwo`) is the entire cast/channel split: with
//! it set, the per-hop window and the expiry are both bypassed and the beam lives until swept
//! (`LightningObject::Stop 0x6ece10`, whose one caller image-wide is the channel teardown).
//!
//! **Endpoints are identities, re-resolved from the live units every frame** (`0x6ec460` runs both
//! through `ClntObjMgr` each tick), so a beam tracks a moving caster and a moving target; a hop
//! whose unit is not resolvable is *hidden*, not re-pathed. The caster's end anchors at its `$CSL`
//! marker, else `base + 0.75 × modelHeight × modelScale` (`0x6ec6f0`); every other endpoint anchors
//! at the M2 attachment named by the spell's own `SpellVisual` field 9 — the same ordinal the
//! missile homes to — with 34 as the fallback and the unit's base below that (`0x6ec780`).
//!
//! **Geometry per hop** (`0x7af6d0`), all VERIFIED:
//! - `n = trunc(len / avgSegLen + 2.0)` sub-segments, `n+1` points, `point[i] = lerp(a, b, i/n)`;
//!   the `+2` is a floor, so even a one-yard hop bends.
//! - each interior point takes an independent 3-vector in `[−1, 1]³` scaled by `len × noiseScale`,
//!   **re-rolled every frame**, and the live polyline advects toward it `0.75` old / `0.25` new.
//! - the ribbon's cross-section is the **world-horizontal** perpendicular `(−d.y, d.x, 0)` in WoW
//!   axes — [`Vec3::Y.cross`] here, the same vector — normalized only when it is longer than
//!   `0.001`, so a hop pointing straight up (or straight at a camera looking down it) collapses to
//!   nothing. That is the reference's own regime, not an artefact.
//! - an interior vertex sits at `p ± 0.5·(perp₍ᵢ₋₁₎ + perpᵢ)·halfWidth`; **both ends collapse to a
//!   point** with `v = 0.5` — the beam is a spindle, tapered at caster and target.
//! - `u` runs `0 → 1` caster→target, translated by `−(phase / period)` where
//!   `phase = fmod(phase + dt, period)`; a **negative** period reverses the scroll, which is what
//!   flows the four drain textures back toward the caster.
//!
//! **Render state** (`0x7afcb0`, decoded against wow-re's own verified `EGxRs` map): additive
//! `SRC_ALPHA/ONE`, emissive white — a beam is **never tinted** — two-sided, depth-write off, fog
//! **off**. It rides the shared effect-quad stream ([`crate::particles::buffer::EffectQuads`]) like
//! every other dynamic effect; `crate::ribbons` is the structural model (same strip-as-quads
//! conversion, same commit).
//!
//! **Named approximations.** (a) The strand count (`CharParamOne`, ≤ 3 — only Chain Burn ships > 1)
//! is modelled as N independently-jittered copies of one polyline: the reference builds them from
//! byte-identical arguments and they diverge *only* through their interleaved draws on the shared
//! PRNG, which is a shared-generator detail we do not reproduce, so ours diverge by construction
//! instead. (b) The `SMSG_SPELL_GO` producer leg is gated in the reference on `0x6e4870`'s return, a
//! predicate the §5 could not settle; we fill unconditionally — the superset, harmless because
//! consumption still requires a chain proc, and because every producer clears before it fills.
//! (c) A channel re-enters the dispatcher every tick (`0x612b18`) where we hold one beam for the
//! channel's life; the observable — a steady beam that ends with the channel — is the same.
//! (d) A beam takes no owner-last draw rung and no water-plane interleave: it belongs to no model.
