//! Spell **missiles** (decision 0099 phase 4): the travelling projectile a Speed>0 cast launches
//! at each target — Fireball's fireball, an NPC frostbolt — and the impact hand-off when it
//! arrives.
//!
//! The router (`crate::creature_anim::spell_visual::route_cast_visuals`) resolves the GO's DBC
//! chain and emits one [`MissileSpawn`]; this module owns launch and flight.
//!
//! **Launch is release-keyed, not GO-keyed** (the client's `unit+0xac` pending queue): a GO whose
//! cast kit plays a body animation parks its projectiles on the caster ([`PendingMissiles`]) and
//! launches them when that animation's **release event keyframe** fires — `$CSL`/`$CSR`/`$CST`
//! (casting hand left/right/two-hand) or `$BWR` (ranged release), the anim-event dispatcher's
//! drain arms (`0x5ffbd0` → `0x60c940`) — from the fired marker's live bone-ridden position: the
//! fireball leaves the raised hand at the top of the throw, not the hold pose at GO. A GO with no
//! cast-kit animation launches immediately (`0x6e7a70`'s flush), and a queued cast whose keyframe
//! never fires launches when the one-shot ends (the client's on-anim-finish `0x5fc920` →
//! `0x60c9b0`), both through the same `$CSL` → `$CSR` → `$CST` → unit-base cascade (`0x60c9b0`).
//!
//! The **arrival deadline is fixed at GO** (the client's `0x61ceb0`: remaining travel time =
//! `distance / Spell.dbc Speed` **minus the time spent queued** — riding the hand eats flight
//! time, the same clock the server delays the damage by). A release already past its deadline
//! arrives on the spot — at melee range there is no visible flight or trail at all, just the
//! impact on the target, exactly the reference's close-range look.
//!
//! In flight, the client's **arrive-on-time** mover (`0x61ceb0`/`0x61e2a0`, wow-re `w2f1.md`):
//! one entity per target, model parts + particle emitters from the shared [`SpellFx`] path-keyed
//! cache (the same held-items pattern as the attach-point effects); each frame the missile covers
//! `remaining distance / remaining time · dt` toward the target's **destination attach point** —
//! so a moving target bends the path (homing) and arrival lands exactly on schedule. Arrival on a
//! landed target writes [`CastEventKind::Impact`] back to the router (the client's unit-impact
//! hand-off `0x61dc50`); arrival on a missed target plays the victim's dodge/block defense clip
//! instead ([`miss_defense_state`] — the `0x61ceb0` dispatch, never Parry).
//!
//! A missile with no visual-chain model flies the **wire ammo model** instead (decision 0099
//! phase 5 — every basic shot spell: Auto Shot, the Shoot family, Throw, all `SpellVisual = 0`):
//! the GO's ammo block names an `ItemDisplayInfo` row, resolved by its **shape** — flight model
//! in the right slot → `Item\ObjectComponents\Ammo\` (arrows/bullets), left slot → `…\Weapon\`
//! (thrown: the weapon itself flies) — each with its own object skin, exactly the held-items
//! texture mechanism. The client resolves the same row through `0x479f40`, forking on the wire's
//! ammo InventoryType (`0x19` = thrown); the shape rule reproduces it on every real row
//! (`benilla-formats` `items.rs` tests). No model at all (no chain, no ammo) → the missile flies
//! invisible and still impacts on schedule.
//!
//! Approximations, named: `$BWR` launches from its own event marker rather than the ranged
//! weapon model's HandArrow/Bullet attachment (`0x23`/`0x24` — the client's first choices before
//! it, too, falls back to the event position); the anim-end flush is a **polled** edge (plus a
//! [`RELEASE_WAIT_MAX`] never-played timeout) where the client gets a per-anim finish callback;
//! homing aims at the dest attach point rather than solving the client's
//! ray-vs-bounding-sphere intercept (`0x61d230` — same body point in practice); a missed
//! target's arrival plays its dodge/block clip but the projectile itself still ends there
//! rather than deflecting (`0x61dd50`'s bounce).
//!
//! A GO with **no unit targets at all** but a point on the wire flies **one** projectile at the
//! point — the client's location fallback (`0x6e8a50`'s empty-hit-array arm → `0x60a3d0` once,
//! owning unit slot −1; wow-re `spell-go-dest-effect.md` §3). That is the whole visible flight of
//! a pure ground cast: the hunter's Flare arcing out to where it was placed, a bomb thrown at
//! empty dirt. Such a missile homes to nothing — its aim is a fixed world point ([`Aim::Ground`])
//! — and it arrives as [`CastEventKind::GroundImpact`] on the CASTER (`0x61e1d0`'s ground arm
//! `0x61d870`), never through the unit hand-off. Named approximation: it flies the same straight
//! arrive-on-time line a unit missile does; the reference's trajectory *class* comes from
//! `CMissile+0x48` through `0x61d720`'s remap table, whose wire origin wow-re traced to
//! consumption only — so a lobbed shot reads as a straight glide here.
