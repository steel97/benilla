//! **The guard's directions** — the marker `SMSG_GOSSIP_POI` drops on the minimap and the world
//! map when you ask a city guard where the warrior trainer is (or the bank, or the inn).
//!
//! The wire is volunteered, never requested: a gossip option carrying an `action_poi_id` makes the
//! server send `{flags, x, y, icon, data, name}` (vmangos `Player::OnGossipSelect` →
//! `PlayerMenu::SendPointOfInterest`, `GossipDef.cpp:253`). Every 5875-era row ships
//! `icon = 6` (`ICON_POI_REDFLAG` — the red flag with the yellow `!`) and `flags = 99`.
//!
//! **The reference does NOT give this its own drawing code.** It builds a synthetic `AreaPOI`
//! record out of the packet and appends it to the minimap's landmark candidate list — one fixed
//! static slot, so a new marker overwrites the old. Byte law and packet→record map:
//! `wow-5875-re` `system/ui/scratch/gossip-poi-marker.md` (the §5 for this feature, folded back as 1516) — handler
//! `0x4e2840`, `set_blip 0x6dac10` writing static slot **1** at `0xcea7d4`, and
//! `minimap-poi-questdot.md` §A3's candidate array, which appends the static slots
//! *unconditionally*, bypassing the DBC scan's `ContinentID`/`Flags & 1` gate. So it is a landmark
//! in every way that follows — the 0.8 in/out split, the `POIIcons` cell picked by `Icon`, the rim
//! arrow, the nearest-3 `Importance` rank, the 694.444-yd rank cut (the marker gets **no**
//! exemption from it — that belongs to the corpse slot `0xcea848`), the hover tooltip on both the
//! icon and the arrow. This module holds only what is *specific* to the marker: the record, and
//! its lifetime. The drawing is [`crate::minimap::blips`] and the world map's POI pool.
//!
//! **The lifetime is four ways to lose it, whichever comes first** (all VERIFIED, §5):
//! - **8 minutes.** `set_blip` stamps a deadline of `time() + 480` — *seconds*, not the
//!   milliseconds a `GetTickCount` reading would suggest (`0x429580` is a cached `time()`; the
//!   tick count is only its 500 ms cache check).
//! - **Arriving.** `minimap_update 0x6d93a0` clears it once `(player − marker)² < 100`
//!   (`0x806b10`) — strictly inside 10 yards, the boundary excluded.
//! - **A replacing packet.** One slot; the next set of directions overwrites this one.
//! - **World entry.** The world-enter path runs `zone_rebuild`, which stamps the slot clear. Ours
//!   maps that to a worldport and to logging out — the two ways a benilla session re-enters.
//!
//! The record keeps the map it was given on, because the wire has no map field and the world map
//! must project the marker through *some* map's rect. The reference re-derives the same thing from
//! its live current-map global at `set_blip` time (`+0x1c ContinentID ← [0x86f694]`).
