//! The world as the UI's **backdrop quad** — the seam that put the UI-over-world blend back into
//! gamma bytes (the third and last piece of the composite lane 0161 and 0254 built).
//!
//! ## The seam that was left
//!
//! Both halves of the frame already composite the way the reference's fixed-function device does,
//! and each does it by the same trick. The world (0161): every world shader emits raw gamma bytes,
//! the blur runs on them, and the FFXGlow combine takes the frame's one `srgb_to_linear` so the
//! sRGB present-encode restores the byte. The UI (0254): `ui_quad.wgsl` emits gamma values into an
//! `Rgba8UnormSrgb` target, so the store encodes, the blend's destination read decodes, and every
//! hardware blend is therefore arithmetic on the gamma value — `alphaMode="ADD"` really is
//! `dst + texel·α`, clamped, exactly as EGxBlend 3 does it.
//!
//! Two correct byte lanes, and **the UI-over-world blend fell in the seam between them.** The UI
//! camera composited its finished image onto the swapchain through its output blit, and the
//! swapchain view is sRGB, so that one blend — the only one that mixes UI with world — ran in
//! linear. 0254 named it as a residual and described it as "a small deviation on antialiased UI
//! edges over the world". It is not an edge artefact: it is every translucent UI pixel over the
//! 3D world, at full area.
//!
//! Measured on the chat dock, which is the most translucent surface the client has.
//! `ChatFrameTab`'s body is black at α = 102/255, so a docked tab must leave the scene at **60 %**
//! of its brightness; the unselected tab (frame α 0.5) at 80 %. Against a bare-scene capture of
//! the same pixels (`ui-chat-tabhover` at `$WOW_TABHOVER=9`) they measured **77.5 %** and **89 %** —
//! and a linear composite predicts exactly that, to within a byte, at every point checked
//! (scene 93 → 72 vs 72.5 predicted; 70 → 54 vs 53.9; 95 → 74 vs 74.1). The tab had almost no
//! plate, so the hover glow — an ADD, at full strength — sat on nothing and read as a blue lozenge
//! floating on grass, louder than the tab that was actually selected. That is what the director
//! reported, and it was never a chat bug.
//!
//! ## The fix: put the world *inside* the UI's byte buffer
//!
//! Not a third lane. The world camera renders off-screen, and the **first draw of the UI
//! camera's main pass** is the world's own final pass — the FFXGlow combine ([`FfxBackdrop`],
//! decision 2234) — rendered straight into the UI's byte target as the ground everything else is
//! painted on, inside the very pass that paints it (a pass of its own would cost a tile GPU a
//! load and a store of the whole target). Every UI blend
//! over the world is then the same blend as every UI blend over UI: the one 0254 already
//! verified, in the target it already verified it in. The output blit stops blending entirely (it
//! now carries an opaque frame), which retires the `rgb·a²` hazard 0254 had to patch
//! `PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA_BLENDING` around.
//!
//! **It was a picture first** (1603): the combine wrote a full-window un-encoded float image that
//! this pass drew as its first quad, the quad re-encoding what it sampled back to the byte the
//! combine had computed. That is one write and one read of every pixel at eight bytes each, and
//! on a bandwidth-bound GPU it is a third of the full-screen chain (2234's rig). The combine now
//! stores that byte itself, in the UI lane's own terms (`ui_quad.wgsl`'s premultiply, no decode),
//! and the picture is gone. What the world camera still carries as a target is a **size-carrier**:
//! a one-byte image at the world's render size that nothing writes, kept because bevy sizes a
//! view's main texture from its target and the camera's logical viewport is held through it
//! ([`retarget_world_camera`]).
//!
//! Nothing about the world lane's arithmetic changes: the combine's byte math is the same, the
//! frame still holds exactly one decode — the UI lane's, at its end — and an opaque world pixel
//! comes out the byte it came out before, minus the float image's own rounding on the way.
//!
//! ## …and that seam turned out to be a dial: **render scale** (decision 1639)
//!
//! Once the world is a picture the UI paints on, the picture does not have to be the window's size.
//! [`RenderScale`] sizes it — the world renders at `window × scale`, the combine still covers the
//! window, and **the UI is untouched at native resolution**, because the combine runs at the UI
//! camera's own size and only *samples* the scaled world, and nothing here can move that. That is
//! the whole reason this is worth having rather than "run the game in a smaller window": text,
//! icons and frame art stay exactly as sharp as they were, and only the 3D pays.
//!
//! **Below 1 it buys frames; above 1 it is supersampling** — and above 1 is the half this machine
//! can measure, since `gxMultisample` defaults to off (1629) and the client therefore ships with no
//! antialiasing of any kind. At exactly 2.0 the combine's plain bilinear read of the scene *is* a
//! 2×2 box average (the destination pixel centre lands on the corner four texels share, weighting
//! each 0.25), so SSAA×2 needs no filter of its own.
//!
//! **The one number that must not move is the camera's LOGICAL viewport**, and
//! [`render_target_for`] is built around holding it fixed — [`retarget_world_camera`] says what
//! reads it (every pick ray in the client) and why getting it wrong is B169 over again.
