//! The world as the UI's **backdrop quad** — the seam that put the UI-over-world blend back into
//! gamma bytes (the third and last piece of the composite lane 0161 and 0254 built).
//!
//! ## The seam that was left
//!
//! Both halves of the frame already composite the way the reference's fixed-function device does,
//! and each does it by the same trick. The world (0161): every world shader emits raw gamma bytes,
//! the blur runs on them, and the FFXGlow combine takes the frame's one `srgb_to_linear` so the
//! sRGB present-encode restores the byte. The UI (0254): `ui_quad.wgsl` emits gamma values into an
//! `Rgba8UnormSrgb` target, so the store encodes, the blend's destination read decodes, and every
//! hardware blend is therefore arithmetic on the gamma value — `alphaMode="ADD"` really is
//! `dst + texel·α`, clamped, exactly as EGxBlend 3 does it.
//!
//! Two correct byte lanes, and **the UI-over-world blend fell in the seam between them.** The UI
//! camera composited its finished image onto the swapchain through its output blit, and the
//! swapchain view is sRGB, so that one blend — the only one that mixes UI with world — ran in
//! linear. 0254 named it as a residual and described it as "a small deviation on antialiased UI
//! edges over the world". It is not an edge artefact: it is every translucent UI pixel over the
//! 3D world, at full area.
//!
//! Measured on the chat dock, which is the most translucent surface the client has.
//! `ChatFrameTab`'s body is black at α = 102/255, so a docked tab must leave the scene at **60 %**
//! of its brightness; the unselected tab (frame α 0.5) at 80 %. Against a bare-scene capture of
//! the same pixels (`ui-chat-tabhover` at `$WOW_TABHOVER=9`) they measured **77.5 %** and **89 %** —
//! and a linear composite predicts exactly that, to within a byte, at every point checked
//! (scene 93 → 72 vs 72.5 predicted; 70 → 54 vs 53.9; 95 → 74 vs 74.1). The tab had almost no
//! plate, so the hover glow — an ADD, at full strength — sat on nothing and read as a blue lozenge
//! floating on grass, louder than the tab that was actually selected. That is what the director
//! reported, and it was never a chat bug.
//!
//! ## The fix: put the world *inside* the UI's byte buffer
//!
//! Not a third lane. The world camera renders to an off-screen image instead of the swapchain, and
//! that image is drawn as the **first quad of the UI pass** — the ground everything else is painted
//! on. Every UI blend over the world is then the same blend as every UI blend over UI: the one
//! 0254 already verified, in the target it already verified it in. The output blit stops blending
//! entirely (it now carries an opaque frame), which retires the `rgb·a²` hazard 0254 had to patch
//! `PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA_BLENDING` around.
//!
//! **The image is un-encoded float, and both halves of that are borrowed rather than invented** —
//! it is the portrait booths' own target format, chosen there for the same two reasons
//! ([`crate::portrait`]'s `new_target_image`). Un-encoded, because the UI arc composites in gamma
//! and takes its one decode at the end: a backdrop that pre-encoded would land a second encode in
//! that chain. `ui_quad.wgsl`'s ordinary arm re-encodes what it samples (`linear_to_srgb`), which
//! turns FFXGlow's linear output back into the client's byte — the same round trip a booth image
//! takes, and exact in f32. Float rather than `Rgba8Unorm`, because quantizing *un-encoded* values
//! to 8 bits is B126's banding collapse (decision 0804): below display byte 100 an un-encoded 8-bit
//! grid reaches ~25 levels where the gamma backbuffer has 100.
//!
//! Nothing about the world lane changes: FFXGlow keeps its decode, the frame still holds exactly
//! one, and an opaque world pixel must come out byte-identical to before. That identity is the
//! regression test, the same one 0161 used.
//!
//! ## …and that seam turned out to be a dial: **render scale** (decision 1639)
//!
//! Once the world is a picture the UI paints on, the picture does not have to be the window's size.
//! [`RenderScale`] sizes it — the world renders at `window × scale`, the quad still covers the
//! window, and **the UI is untouched at native resolution**, because [`emit_backdrop_quad`]
//! measures the quad in the window's LOGICAL size and nothing here can move that. That is the whole
//! reason this is worth having rather than "run the game in a smaller window": text, icons and
//! frame art stay exactly as sharp as they were, and only the 3D pays.
//!
//! **Below 1 it buys frames; above 1 it is supersampling** — and above 1 is the half this machine
//! can measure, since `gxMultisample` defaults to off (1629) and the client therefore ships with no
//! antialiasing of any kind. At exactly 2.0 the plain bilinear resolve *is* a 2×2 box average (the
//! destination pixel centre lands on the corner four texels share, weighting each 0.25), so SSAA×2
//! needs no filter of its own.
//!
//! **The one number that must not move is the camera's LOGICAL viewport**, and
//! [`render_target_for`] is built around holding it fixed — [`retarget_world_camera`] says what
//! reads it (every pick ray in the client) and why getting it wrong is B169 over again.

///
/// - Mutating an `Image` behind its handle makes a whole new GPU texture — `GpuImage`'s
///   `prepare_asset` (`bevy_render/texture/gpu_image.rs`) calls `create_texture` afresh on every
///   `AssetEvent::Modified`.
/// - A material's bind group, by contrast, is captured **once**: `PreparedMaterial2d::prepare_asset`
///   (`bevy_sprite_render/mesh2d/material.rs`) calls `as_bind_group` when the *material* asset is
///   added or modified, and nothing re-prepares it when a texture it named is re-created.
/// - [`crate::ui_pass`] keys its material cache on `AssetId<Image>`. Same id ⇒ same material ⇒ the
///   same bind group, still holding the `TextureView` of the texture we just threw away.
///
/// So the world camera drew into the new texture and the UI kept sampling the old one, forever.
///
/// A new handle fixes it at the identity rather than by invalidating a cache: **`AssetId<Image>` is
/// the tree's name for a GPU texture, so a new GPU texture gets a new name.** Every consumer then
/// reacts on its own — the cache misses and builds a fresh material, [`emit_backdrop_quad`]'s quad
/// differs and flags a rebuild, and [`retarget_world_camera`] re-points the camera.
///
/// It is also the only version that is safe against prepare *order*. `Material2dPlugin` registers
/// `RenderAssetPlugin::<PreparedMaterial2d<M>>::default()` — `AFTER = ()`, i.e. **not** ordered
/// after `prepare_assets::<GpuImage>` — so the "touch the material so its bind group rebuilds"
/// remedy (which `benilla_world::clouds` uses, and whose comment already named this whole hazard)
/// can re-bind the *previous* `GpuImage` if the material happens to prepare first. A fresh
/// `AssetId` cannot: it either finds its own `GpuImage` or `as_bind_group` returns
/// `RetryNextUpdate` and Bevy retries next frame.
///
/// The retired asset is **removed**, not merely dropped, because the stale cache entry is still
