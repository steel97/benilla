//! The loading screen's **tip of the day** (decision 2077; wow-re
//! `system/loadingscreen/scratch/game-tip-of-the-day.md`).
//!
//! `showGameTips`' only mention in 1.12's FrameXML is its options row and the tooltip string
//! "Uncheck this to hide the tip of the day in the load screens", so the whole feature is
//! engine-side: `CGlueMgr::EnterWorld` picks a row from `GameTips.dbc`, hands it to the loading
//! screen's text slot, and writes the *next* index back into the `gameTip` CVar.
//!
//! ## The selection law (`0x46b662`–`0x46b6e3`)
//!
//! **`gameTip` holds the NEXT index, not the one on screen.** The client reads it, shows *that*
//! row, then stores `read + 1`, so on-disk values run 1..=74 and never 0 — a client that stores the
//! index it just showed is off by one, and the reference's own `Config.wtf` (`SET gameTip "34"`) is
//! what a naive reading mis-anchors on.
//!
//! **The wrap is a clamp, not a modulo**: `if (i < 0 || i >= count) i = 0` at `0x46b682`–`0x46b68f`.
//! `count <= 0` bails. The walk is **sequential**, never random.
//!
//! Two guards sit in front of it. `showGameTips` off jumps past the `CVar::Set` as well as the
//! draw (`0x46b671`/`0x46b678`), so **turning tips off freezes the index** rather than advancing it
//! invisibly. And `[selChar+0x10a]` — a *client-synthesised* flag, set by `0x5b42a0` iff the
//! `SMSG_CHAR_ENUM` level byte arrived as `0` — suppresses the tip for a character the roster
//! reported at level zero. vmangos always sends a real level, so that arm is unreachable against
//! our server; it is honoured anyway because it costs one comparison.
//!
//! ## Where it draws
//!
//! **Only on the glue→world transition.** The setter `0x406630` (a seven-byte
//! `mov [0x882e10],ecx; ret`) has exactly one caller, and neither `SMSG_TRANSFER_PENDING` arm sets
//! it — so an in-world portal or worldport screen carries **no tip**. That is why this module hangs
//! off the loading screen's `world entry` raise.
//!
//! **It comes down with the screen, never with a raise.** `[0x882e10]`'s only other writer
//! image-wide is `0x407f2b`, inside the dismiss `0x407e80` — so the two edges are *pick at the
//! entry raise* and *clear at the dismiss*, and nothing that happens mid-load can take a tip away.
//! This module used to clear on every non-entry raise, which read the same for an in-world screen
//! (the tip was already down) and was wrong for exactly one case: the login snap
//! `SMSG_LOGIN_VERIFY_WORLD`, which benilla was treating as a fresh load, wiped the tip a server
//! round-trip into **every** world entry.
//!
//! The reference lays the text out **once per raise** and draws it every frame, between the
//! background quad and the progress bar. Its placement, in the screen's own `[0,1]` ortho:
//! `s = 515 / (a · 1024)` where `a = [0x832a4c]` is **aspect × 0.75** (not the aspect — the writer
//! `0x41ad10` multiplies by `0.75` first, and reading it as W/H inflates the wrap width by a third
//! at 16:9); position `(0.5 − s·0.5, 0.1 + yoff, 0)`; `justifyH = 0` (left); wrap width `s`; body
//! `0xd7c8c8c8` ARGB with an opaque black shadow at `(+0.001, −0.001)`.
//!
//! **Placing it in the 4:3 box is not an approximation of that — it is the same numbers.** The
//! reference's `[0,1]` ortho spans the whole window, so its `s` and `left` both carry `a`; ours are
//! percentages of a box that is `H` tall and `4H/3` wide. Multiply them out and the `a` cancels:
//!
//! ```text
//! ref wrap  = s·W          = 515·W / (a·1024)          = 515·H / (1024·0.75) = 0.6706·H
//! our wrap  = s₁·(4H/3)    = (515/1024)·(4H/3)                               = 0.6706·H
//! ref left  = (0.5 − s/2)·W                                   = 0.5·W − 0.3353·H
//! our left  = (W − 4H/3)/2 + (0.5 − s₁/2)·(4H/3)              = 0.5·W − 0.3353·H
//! ```
//!
//! …for **every** aspect, not just 4:3 — the reference's own wrap column is a constant multiple of
//! the window HEIGHT, which is exactly what a height-fit letterboxed box makes it. And `yoff` is
//! settled rather than dodged: `0x4066b9`'s `fcom; fnstsw; test ah,5; jp` takes the `(1 − a)·0.5`
//! arm **only for `a < 1`**, so on any window at least 4:3 wide the term is zero and the two
//! layouts agree bit for bit. Narrower than 4:3 they part — but so does the whole loading screen
//! there (our box overflows where the reference letterboxes top and bottom), and that is the
//! screen's difference to answer, not the tip's.
//!
//! `TIP_BOTTOM`'s `0.1` is not a round number either: `0x4066ee` builds it as `0.05·0.5 + 0.075`,
//! which is the bar border's own `halfH·0.5 + cy` — **the tip's baseline IS the top edge of the
//! progress bar**, so the block always sits directly on it.
//!
//! The `|cffffd100Tip:|r ` prefix and the trailing `\r\n` are **in the DBC data**, and the escapes
//! *are* interpreted (`0x5c28af`, flags bit `0x800` clear), so the gold "Tip:" is markup rather
//! than literal text — which is why the line is built through [`benilla_ui::markup`] rather than
//! drawn as one string.
