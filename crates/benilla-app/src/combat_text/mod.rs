//! **Floating combat text** (decision 0137 phase 2) — the client's WORLDTEXTSTRING engine
//! (wow-re `playername/scratch/worldtext-spawn-and-law.md`, §5-verified 2026-07-05).
//!
//! The law, transcribed: a combat-log SMSG's handler picks a **category 0–5** and submits a string
//! over the damage/outcome **recipient**; the text is **world-anchored** — the unit's OVERHEAD
//! anchor is snapshotted at spawn (`0x6c73f0` → `0x608640`: the posed PlayerName attachment,
//! slot 18 — head height, tracking model stature intrinsically; fallback `feet + scale × bbox_z ×
//! 1.25`), lifted `z − 1/3`, then re-projected to the screen every frame (`0x483ee0`), rising and
//! fading per the category's row in the config table `0xce8828`. Numbers
//! are bare unsigned `"%d"`; misses are localized WORDS (the shipped enUS `GlobalStrings.lua`
//! values, patch-2.MPQ). At most **4 concurrent texts per unit — a hard drop, not an eviction**
//! (`0x6c73f0`). Self-anchored damage text is suppressed at the emitters (Gate A, `0x607140`/
//! `0x6128b0`): outgoing damage floats over the victim, incoming damage never floats over your own
//! head; the XP emitter (category 4) is self-anchored by design and skips the gate. Heals and
//! energize NEVER float in 5875 (chat log only; there is no `CombatHealing` cvar).
//!
//! **The COLOR law** (wow-re `playername/scratch/combattext-color-law.md`, §5-verified
//! 2026-07-06 — the director's "melee vs spell differ" CONFIRMED): the emitters key two bits —
//! `B` (record NULL ⇒ melee, or **AttributesEx3 bit-15** — `SpellRec+0x24`'s word; the note's
//! "+0x25 sign" byte) and `K` (the `0x5efea0` **source-ownership** class: self / owned-by-me /
//! other). Master gate: the CombatDamage cvar. Self melee → **WHITE** (NULL override ⇒ the row
//! default); self spell/periodic → **GOLD** `0xFFFFDE00`; pet melee → **ORANGE** `0xFFFF8400`
//! (PetMeleeDamage cvar); pet spell → GOLD (PetSpellDamage cvar); **any OTHER source is
//! suppressed entirely** — another unit's fight floats nothing (the emitter returns before
//! submitting; it was never "white"). Crit does NOT recolor (it only picks the pop row); there
//! is NO school coloring. The bit-15 flip is [`melee_styled`] (decision 0376): the flag is
//! `SPELL_ATTR3_NORMAL_RANGED_ATTACK` — set on exactly 8 rows of the real DBC, the ranged
//! auto-attack family — so a Throw/Auto Shot number floats white off
//! `SMSG_SPELLNONMELEEDAMAGELOG`.
//!
//! **The WORD emitter runs that same law** (decision 2229, closing what phase 2 left open). The
//! two emitters are separate functions — `0x607140` takes three stack args and `0x6128b0` four,
//! so they are not the "byte-identical twins" the first reading called them — but they compute
//! `B` and `K` identically, and **seven of the eight `0x607140` call sites push a resolved
//! SpellRec**. Only the melee swing's word site (`0x624511`, every one of its seven predecessors
//! a `6a 00 push 0x0`) pushes NULL. So a spell's "Miss"/"Resist"/"Immune" is spell-GOLD exactly
//! like its number, and only a white hit's miss is white. The three CVar gates live *inside*
//! `0x607140`, so `CombatDamage 0` silences words as well as numbers, on every path.
//!
//! **A travelling spell's word is DEFERRED to the projectile's arrival.** `SMSG_SPELL_GO`'s
//! inline emit is skipped whenever `Spell.dbc` Speed is nonzero (`0x6e7d4e`), and the missile's
//! own arrival handlers re-resolve the record and call the same emitter: a resisted Fireball
//! reads "Resist" when the ball lands, a missed Sinister Strike at packet receive.
//! [`missile_miss_text`] is that arrival half, fed by [`crate::entities::MissileMiss`].
//!
//! **The render geometry** (wow-re `worldtext-geometry-law.md`, §5-verified, 9af65294 — zero free
//! parameters; the anchor-seat half corrected here, see the seating comment in
//! [`float_combat_text`]): the rise is added to **world z before projection**; the block is
//! **h-centered with its bottom at** the projected point (rising above it), clamped on-screen —
//! but only once the projector has ACCEPTED the point at all: a number whose anchor lands behind
//! the camera or outside the viewport is **destroyed and its slot released**
//! (`6c7d9d` → `6c6dda` → `0x6c86a0`; wow-re `object-layer/scratch/nameplate-offscreen-cull.md`,
//! §5-VERIFIED 2026-08-15), never clamped to a border and never claiming a bucket-1 rect. Ours
//! clamped, which put another unit's numbers on the screen edge — the worldtext half of 1341's
//! phantom plates, and the half that record's §7 wrongly called byte-attested;
//! the on-screen size is
//! **constant with unit distance** (the depth counter-scale exists only in the *nameplate* path)
//! and composes as `px = round_half_away(v × √(W²+H²))` — `v` the category's interpolated scale
//! value, the diagonal the gx screencoord unit (`0x832a44/48` hold the live aspect basis; the
//! first reading hardcoded its 4:3 value 0.6 — see [`text_px`]), the round being the gx
//! `ScreenToPixelHeight` law (`0x5c6fa0`, wow-re `crates/font/src/screen_pixel.rs`, bit-exact
//! difftested). At 1024×768 (diag 1280): normal number 23 px, crit settles 35 px, pop peaks ~70 px.
//! The font is **whatever the Lua global `DAMAGE_TEXT_FONT` holds** when `0x6c8470` reads it —
//! see [`DamageTextFont`] for the binding law (a plain `lua_gettable`, evaluated once, at the tail
//! of the world-entry UI load, i.e. after every addon's `ADDON_LOADED`). `Fonts\FRIZQT__.TTF` is
//! only the value the shipped `Fonts.xml` assigns, not a default the engine knows; there is in
//! fact **no fallback face at all** in the reference — a global that resolves to nothing yields a
//! NULL handle and the combat text simply does not draw. Created flags 0 (`6c8493 xor edx,edx` —
//! not `6c8498`, which is `mov ecx,esi`): no outline.
//!
//! **The ALPHA + SHADOW law** (`time_alpha_fade 0x6c82e0` — wow-re
//! `playername/scratch/worldtext-alpha-shadow-law.md`, §5 pair + the emulated bit-exact difftest,
//! 2026-07-12; the director's "XP text less visible than ref"): the per-tick fade REPLACES the
//! live color's alpha byte (`mov [obj+0x23], bl` — the ARGB high byte), it never multiplies. The
//! plateau between fade-in end and fade-out start is an **unconditional `(0xFF, 0x7F)`** — so the
//! config table's packed alpha (row 4's `0x80`) is dead data, overwritten before it ever renders:
//! the XP text is FULLY OPAQUE mid-life. Fade-in ramps text `255·t`, shadow `127·t` with
//! `t = elapsed/DURATION` (the +0x0c field — not fade-in-end, so the boundary is a pop-in step,
//! not a ramp arrival), and the fade-in branch is tested FIRST (row 1's `fade_out 90 < fade_in
//! 150` has NO plateau: pop ~25 → ~244 at 150 ms, then the long taper). Fade-out over
//! `[fade_out, duration]`: text `255 − clamp(255·u)` down to 0 — but the shadow lane is the
//! byte-true inversion `255 − clamp(127·u, 0, 127)` ∈ [128, 255]: it JUMPS 0x7F→~0xFF at
//! fade-out start and decays only to 128 (verified constants `[0x7ffe58]=255.0`,
//! `[0x811310]=127.0` — not a half factor — `[0x7ffd74]=0.0`; `__ftol` truncates). The shadow is
//! black, `(al<<24)|0` → `SetShadowColor 0x5c27a0` with the static offset `0xce8804 =
//! {0.002, 0.002}` (init `0x6c7c20`), every category, unconditionally.
//!
//! **The STORE seam caps the shadow** (font node `outline-bake-tint.md` §5, byte-verified):
//! `SetShadowColor`'s persistent store `0x5cd650` writes the shadow colour's alpha byte as
//! **`min(shadowA, mainA)`** — and `time_alpha_fade` calls SetColor (text) *then* SetShadowColor
//! every tick, so the RENDERED shadow alpha is `min(shadow lane, text alpha)`. The fade-out
//! lane's byte-true `[128, 255]` inversion is dead past the text's own value: the rendered
//! shadow steps up to ~0xFF at fade-out start, then tracks the text alpha down to **0** — it
//! never lingers at the 128 floor (transcribing the raw lane as the rendered alpha was exactly
//! the black ghost the director reported in the fade tail). The offset statics are a **viewport
//! fraction**, converted per-axis at draw (`0x5c8710` → `ScreenToPixelWidth 0x5c7010` ×W /
//! `ScreenToPixelHeight 0x5c6fa0` ×H, each `+0.5`-truncate rounded): `offset_px =
//! {round(0.002·W), round(0.002·H)}`, drawn **down-right** (the Y-down ortho), shadow pass
//! before main — the whole as-rendered law is wow-re
//! `playername/scratch/worldtext-shadow-render-law.md` (§5 three pairs, 2026-07-13).
//!
//! **The anti-overlap push IS real** — decision 0367, superseding 0363's "none exists" (that
//! verdict was true of the worldtext code and wrong about the system: the push lives in the
//! shared `UIUtil\SmartScreenRect` draw-time solver, wow-re
//! `ui/scratch/smartscreenrect-solver-law.md`, §5 2026-07-13). Every frame each live string
//! submits its desired rect — the clamped projected center ± its **crit-pop-scaled** measured
//! half-extents — to claim **bucket 1** ([`crate::smart_rect`]), gets relocated off the strings
//! already seated this frame, and draws from the returned rect (`0x6c7cc0` → `0x509520`,
//! unconditional). Seat order is the ref's container walk with slots DESCENDING (`0x6c6e00`
//! reads +0x2c→+0x20) over the first-free-slot fill — so the newest co-anchored number usually
//! seats first and the OLDER one jumps to make room. The push re-derives from the anchor every
//! frame: when the blocker expires the string snaps back. On top of that layer ride the timing
//! mechanisms this module already carries (the impact-frame deferral, the fast rise, the crit
//! park-and-pop, the 4-slot hard drop).
//!
//! The emitters here are fed by `net/apply` (the SMSG spawn table lives in the handlers there,
//! mirroring the client's registration); this module owns the law: categories, words, cap,
//! timing/scale/fade, and the projection into [`UiQuads`] (appended *after* the script extract —
//! see [`crate::ui_pass::UiQuadAppend`]).
