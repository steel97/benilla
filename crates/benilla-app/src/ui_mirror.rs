//! The mirror-timer feed: breath / fatigue / feign-death off the wire → FrameXML events
//! (decision 0874).
//!
//! The net bridge queues [`MirrorTimerEdge`]s and the drain fires the reference client's
//! FrameScript events into the script VM — `MIRROR_TIMER_START` / `_PAUSE` / `_STOP`, the exact
//! contract `assets/ui/MirrorTimer.xml` (the transcribed 1.12 `MirrorTimer1/2/3`) registers for.
//! The bars themselves are the reference's: the frame stores the value and integrates
//! `value + scale * elapsed` every OnUpdate, so a packet every few seconds is enough to paint a
//! smooth countdown.
//!
//! **The client computes nothing here.** Breath and fatigue are server state — vmangos's
//! `Player::UpdateMirrorTimers` runs them off its own liquid checks (`IsUnderwater`,
//! `IsInHighSea`) and ships a value + a signed rate. That is why there is no local "am I
//! underwater" predicate in this module and should not be one: a second, disagreeing authority
//! is exactly how a bar ends up drifting from the drowning damage that follows it.
//!
//! The `ui_cast::CastBarFeed` pattern throughout — one queue, one drain, no per-frame work.
