//! **V-key nameplates** — `CGNamePlateFrame` (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/nameplate-vkey.md`,
//! §5-verified 2026-07-06): the toggled health-bar plates over units' heads, a **2-D overlay**
//! distinct from the world-pass overhead *names* (`crate::nameplates`) they replace.
//!
//! The pinned law, transcribed:
//! - **Master toggles** (`[0xc4da34]` bit 0 enemy / bit 3 friendly; real-client boot default
//!   **OFF** — ours boots enemy ON, friendly OFF (faithful): director calls, 0167 + 0599,
//!   [`VPlateMode::default`]): the `ShowNameplates`/`ShowFriendNameplates` script pairs —
//!   bound to **V / Shift-V** by FrameXML `Bindings.xml` (asset-sourced default, like TAB).
//! - **Gate**: never the own unit; never `NOT_SELECTABLE` (UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS bit 25); enemy bit
//!   covers reaction ≤ neutral, friendly bit ≥ friendly; **max 20 yd**, hardcoded; **no
//!   occlusion** (a 2-D overlay — plates draw through walls); snap, no smoothing; no
//!   anti-overlap. (The friendly-totem exclusion waits on totems existing.)
//! - **Anchor**: the same overhead head point (`0x608640`, [`overhead_anchor`]) **+ 2/3 yd**
//!   (`[0x80abfc]`), projected per frame (`0x483ee0`); the plate's **TOP-CENTER** lands on the
//!   point (it hangs below — §8 Q5) and is edge-clamped half a plate inside the screen;
//!   **constant screen size**: the geometry globals `[0x87d9cc]=0.1` × `[0x87d9d0]=0.025` in gx
//!   screencoord units, where one unit = the screen **diagonal** `√(W²+H²)` (§8 Q4 — and never
//!   uiScale: plates live outside the UIParent cascade). **Our basis is growth-damped** past
//!   [`PLATE_DIAG_KNEE`] — a director-pinned deviation (0185/0186): the real client grows
//!   plates diagonal-linear without limit (§9, byte-closed) and the director rejected that
//!   look; past 1024×768 the plate grows at half the real rate (midway between faithful and
//!   the native size).
//! - **Anatomy — the §7 draw list, byte-verified** (frame offsets/sizes in gx screencoord
//!   units; TEXT heights resolve through the same damped basis, [`text_px`];
//!   back → front): the `Nameplate-Border` frame filling the 0.1 × 0.025 rect — its 128 × 32 art
//!   **sharp-resampled** to the plate's exact size ([`border`], 0188) so it reads crisp, not
//!   bilinear-magnified; the
//!   `UI-TargetingFrame-BarFill` health bar (0.0804 × 0.007025 at BOTTOMLEFT + (0.0031,
//!   0.003125)) — fill = HEALTH/MAXHEALTH as a **left-anchored crop** (u1 = fraction), instant,
//!   REACTION-tinted (hostile red / neutral yellow / friendly green / player pure blue — the
//!   confirmed dwords), **no backing behind missing health** (the border alone), the BORDER
//!   drawn over the fill (its rounded bevels cap the fill's ends — the reference look, a
//!   director-pinned correction to the §7 order); the name (`NAMEPLATE_FONT` = Friz, h 0.01,
//!   BOTTOM at plate CENTER, black 1 px drop shadow — director-tuned from the recorded ±0.001 gx,
//!   no truncation) in WHITE; the level (h 0.0086 — director-pinned one em under the byte 0.009;
//!   CENTER at BOTTOMRIGHT + (−0.0092, +0.0071)) in
//!   the client's exact con dwords over its own grayband table; the skull
//!   (`UI-TargetingFrame-Skull`, 0.01², OVERLAY on the level's anchor) replacing the number for
//!   a world boss (creature rank 3, unconditional) or a hostile ≥ 10 levels up. **No cast bar** exists on 1.12 plates
//!   (ctor-verified: exactly 7 children — the ctor's `Nameplate-Glow` child renders as the
//!   bar brighten below, not as a drawn overlay).
//! - **Highlight = the mouseover unit ∪ the target** (the watcher `0x606f20 → 0x607080` reads
//!   both globals): the bar's own colour brightens — a uniform [`LIT_BOOST`] lift of the fill
//!   tint, gradient untouched, nothing else changes (director-pinned form, 0184; the recorded
//!   ADD `Nameplate-Glow` rim read as hard edge lines on our linear-blending pipeline and is
//!   not drawn). The plate rect is itself mouse-enabled UI: hovering it makes its unit the
//!   mouseover (OnEnter `0x7cb850` → `[0xb4e2c8]`; [`PlateRects`] feeds the shared [`Hovered`]
//!   pick), which also lifts the model emissive and lets clicks select through the plate;
//!   plate-rect hover additionally turns the name yellow `0xFFFFFF00` (OnEnter, name-only).
//!   All decoupled from the target dim below.
//! - **Target highlight**: relative alpha — with a target, the target's plate is opaque and
//!   every other plate drops to `0x7F`; with no target all are opaque.
//! - **Mutually exclusive with the overhead name** (ShouldShowName): a unit with a live plate
//!   never also draws its floating name — [`VPlates`] is that verdict, read by the name driver.
//!   (The questgiver marker raises for a live plate too — a director-pinned DEVIATION: the
//!   reference really does sit low under a plate (byte-verified, wow-re `questgiver-marker.md`
//!   Q4a) and the director rejected that overlap; rationale on `quest_markers::pose_markers`,
//!   0408/0409.)
//!
//! (The skull's trivial-gray leg is the shared grey check, [`benilla_ui::script::unit_is_grey`]
//! — `0x5f0700`, §5-VERIFIED 2026-07-17, the same one the tooltip/quest-range APIs read; it is
//! vacuous on a ≥ +10 hostile and kept for transcription fidelity.)
