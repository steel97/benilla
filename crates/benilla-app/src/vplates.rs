//! **V-key nameplates** — `CGNamePlateFrame` (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/nameplate-vkey.md`,
//! §5-verified 2026-07-06): the toggled health-bar plates over units' heads, a **2-D overlay**
//! distinct from the world-pass overhead *names* (`crate::nameplates`) they replace.
//!
//! The pinned law, transcribed:
//! - **Master toggles** (`[0xc4da34]` bit 0 enemy / bit 3 friendly; real-client boot default
//!   **OFF for both**, and since 1804 ours too — [`VPlateMode::default`]): the
//!   `ShowNameplates`/`ShowFriendNameplates` script pairs —
//!   bound to **V / Shift-V** by FrameXML `Bindings.xml` (asset-sourced default, like TAB).
//! - **Gate**: never the own unit; never `NOT_SELECTABLE` (UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS bit 25); the
//!   enemy/friendly split is **`CanAttack(localPlayer → unit)`**, NOT a reaction threshold
//!   ([`crate::target::ring::plate_is_friendly`], wow-re `nameplate-category-gate.md` §2/§3,
//!   §5-VERIFIED 2026-08-22 — this file shipped `rank >= 4` for a year and 1530 corrects it) —
//!   and a **player** subject must additionally pass `CanCooperate`, which is nothing but the two
//!   `FactionTemplate` faction-group masks being equal, so a player whose row carries neither
//!   side's mask (a vmangos `.gm on` character is template 35, mask 0) is enemy-category no matter
//!   how friendly they read; **max 20 yd**, hardcoded; **no
//!   occlusion** (a 2-D overlay — plates draw through walls); snap, no smoothing. Anti-overlap
//!   there *is*, since 0367 found the shared solver ([`crate::smart_rect`]) — this file's older
//!   "no anti-overlap" was the census that missed it. And the sphere is bounded by the frustum:
//!   the unit must be **in view** ([`crate::ui_pass::project_overlay`]) or the reference
//!   **destroys** the plate outright (`0x60f600`, before the 20-yard cull — wow-re
//!   `nameplate-offscreen-cull.md`, §5-VERIFIED 2026-08-15); it is never clamped in from
//!   off-screen, which is what ours did (1341/1344).
//!   (The friendly-totem exclusion waits on totems existing.)
//! - **Anchor**: the same overhead head point (`0x608640`, [`overhead_anchor`]) **+ 2/3 yd**
//!   (`[0x80abfc]`), projected per frame (`0x483ee0`); the plate's **TOP-CENTER** lands on the
//!   point (it hangs below — §8 Q5) and is edge-clamped half a plate inside the screen;
//!   **constant screen size**: the geometry globals `[0x87d9cc]=0.1` × `[0x87d9d0]=0.025` in gx
//!   screencoord units, where one unit = the screen **diagonal** `√(W²+H²)` (§8 Q4 — and never
//!   uiScale: plates live outside the UIParent cascade). **Our basis is growth-damped** past
//!   [`PLATE_DIAG_KNEE`] — a director-pinned deviation (0185/0186): the real client grows
//!   plates diagonal-linear without limit (§9, byte-closed) and the director rejected that
//!   look; past 1024×768 the plate grows at half the real rate (midway between faithful and
//!   the native size).
//! - **Anatomy — not here any more.** The plate's six regions, its health-bar child, their
//!   layers and the anchors between them live with the widgets that carry them
//!   ([`benilla_ui::script::nameplate`], decision 2148): the plate is a real `Button` under the
//!   `WorldFrame` and the shared frame→quad path draws it. What stays this file's is everything
//!   about the WORLD — the gate above, the anchor, the projection, the seat, and the damped
//!   basis the geometry is computed in ([`plate_basis`], [`gx_px`], [`text_px`]).
//! - **Highlight = the mouseover unit ∪ the target** (the watcher `0x606f20 → 0x607080` reads
//!   both globals): the bar's own colour brightens — a uniform [`LIT_BOOST`] lift of the fill
//!   tint, gradient untouched, nothing else changes (director-pinned form, 0184; the recorded
//!   ADD `Nameplate-Glow` rim read as hard edge lines on our linear-blending pipeline and is
//!   not drawn). The plate is itself mouse-enabled UI: hovering it makes its unit the mouseover
//!   (OnEnter `0x7cb850` → `[0xb4e2c8]` — [`PlateHover`], read straight off the widget the
//!   pointer landed on since 2159), which also lifts the model emissive, and a completed click
//!   selects through the plate ([`PlateClicks`]); the hover additionally turns the name yellow
//!   `0xFFFFFF00` (OnEnter, name-only).
//!   All decoupled from the target dim below.
//! - **Target highlight**: relative alpha — with a target, the target's plate is opaque and
//!   every other plate drops to `0x7F`; with no target all are opaque.
//! - **Mutually exclusive with the overhead name** (ShouldShowName): a unit with a live plate
//!   never also draws its floating name — [`VPlates`] is that verdict, read by the name driver.
//!   (The questgiver marker raises for a live plate too — a director-pinned DEVIATION: the
//!   reference really does sit low under a plate (byte-verified, wow-re `questgiver-marker.md`
//!   Q4a) and the director rejected that overlap; rationale on `quest_markers::pose_markers`,
//!   2274/2275.)
//!
//! (The skull's trivial-gray leg is the shared grey check, [`benilla_ui::script::unit_is_grey`]
//! — `0x5f0700`, §5-VERIFIED 2026-07-17, the same one the tooltip/quest-range APIs read; it is
//! vacuous on a ≥ +10 hostile and kept for transcription fidelity.)
