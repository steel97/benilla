//! **The application-exit edge** — the one place that says *where* "the client is going down" may
//! be observed, because getting that wrong is silent and costs the player everything they changed
//! (decision 1528).
//!
//! ## The frame the app decides to quit is the last frame there is — but it is not always the only one
//!
//! Bevy's runner checks `App::should_exit()` **after** `app.update()` returns and, if an `AppExit`
//! is there, leaves the event loop (`bevy_winit::state`, `run_app_update`'s tail). So a system that
//! wants to run "on the way out" gets its chance in the same `Main` pass in which the exit was
//! announced — and only if it runs *after* the announcement.
//!
//! What it does **not** get is a guarantee that the pass is the last one (decision 1537). On macOS
//! `event_loop.exit()` is a request, not a return: events already queued still dispatch, and one
//! more `about_to_wait` → `run_app_update` can land before the loop unwinds. `exit_on_all_closed`
//! has no latch of its own — it writes an `AppExit` on **every** frame its window query is empty —
//! so that extra pass announces the exit a second time and every shutdown system reading
//! `MessageReader<AppExit>` runs twice. Observed on the real client, in `scripts/smoke.sh`, roughly
//! one run in three: two `"No windows are open, exiting"` lines 50 ms apart, the second on the far
//! side of winit's own `"Closing window 0v0"`, with a complete duplicate save burst under each.
//!
//! Rewriting the same files twice is harmless; **firing `PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD`/`PLAYER_LOGOUT`
//! into every addon's Lua twice is not**. So the set runs on the *edge*: [`the_exit_frame`] opens
//! on the first frame of a run of announcements and stays shut for the rest of it.
//!
//! Announcements do not all arrive early. The one a **player** produces is the latest of all:
//! clicking the window's close button posts `WindowCloseRequested`, `close_when_requested`
//! (`Update`) despawns the window, and `exit_on_all_closed` (**`PostUpdate`**) writes the
//! `AppExit` (`bevy_window`'s own placement, 0.18.1). Every `Update` system has already run by
//! then. So *"read `MessageReader<AppExit>` in `Update`"* — which is what three of our five
//! shutdown systems did — cannot see the exit a player actually causes, and no later frame will
//! give it a second look.
//!
//! **Measured, not reasoned**: the real client, in the world, closed by its own window button
//! wrote *nothing* — no `saved-variables.lua`, no per-addon `saved/*.lua`, no `addons/*.txt`, no
//! camera pose, no `config.toml`. Every addon's settings and every UI toggle the session changed
//! were lost, and the next login came up on whatever the last *graceful* exit had written. That is
//! the director's *"addon settings don't save between logins"* in one line.
//!
//! ## The rule
//!
//! **Register it here, never by hand.** [`on_app_exit`] puts the system in `Last`, which runs after
//! `PostUpdate` in the same `Main` pass and therefore after every announcement Bevy can make. Two
//! systems already lived there and had quietly been right the whole time
//! (`hover_log::report_on_exit`, `perf::stall::beat` — whose own comment says *"no later frame will
//! run to unlatch anything"*); this makes that the rule instead of a coincidence.
//!
//! ## What this does NOT fix, said out loud
//!
//! An exit the process is never told about in ECS terms still loses the session:
//!
//! - **macOS `Cmd+Q`** goes `terminate:` → `applicationWillTerminate:` → winit's `LoopExiting`,
//!   with no `app.update()` anywhere in it — so there is no schedule to run in. Handled a layer
//!   down instead, by [`benilla_world::mac_quit`], which re-points that menu item at
//!   `performClose:` so the gesture becomes the window close above.
//! - **A crash, a `SIGKILL`, a wedged teardown.** Nothing survives those, and the reference client
//!   loses settings to them too (decision 1128 kept its no-autosave shape deliberately). If we ever
//!   want to beat that, it is an autosave design and its own decision — not a fourth place to read
//!   `AppExit`.
