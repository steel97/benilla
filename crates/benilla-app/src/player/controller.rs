//! It reads as a spine of named phases, and every phase that is a *concern of its own* lives in a
//! module beside this one: [`super::input`] decodes the keys, [`super::wire_in`] applies what the
//! server said, [`super::ride`] carries us on a deck, [`super::posture`] holds the body,
//! [`super::mover`]/[`super::swim`] move it, [`super::flags`] builds the word, [`super::gait`] and
//! [`super::body_pose`] render it, [`super::camera`] seats the eye, and [`super::movement_net`]
//! streams it. What is left here is the *order* — which is itself load-bearing, because the
//! reference's own frame runs in this order and several of the gates below only work where they
//! stand (the swim latch before the mover, the posture commit before the pose, the ack after the
//! launch).
//!
//! Split out of the module root by the same rule the rest of `player/` follows: the root is the
