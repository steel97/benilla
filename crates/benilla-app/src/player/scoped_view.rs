//! **The spyglass zoom** — `SPELL_AURA_FAR_SIGHT` (aura 76), which is not far sight at all.
//!
//! The Ornate Spyglass (item 5507 → spell 12883 "Longsight") reads like a member of the far-sight
//! family and is filed with it in the bug ledger, but the two share only a name. Mind Vision and
//! Sentry Totem are `SPELL_AURA_BIND_SIGHT`, a *server* mechanism: the server moves its own
//! viewpoint and names the object in `PLAYER_FARSIGHT` ([`super::view_subject`]). Aura 76 is a
//! **client-local camera override** and never touches that field — which is why the server appears
//! to do nothing for the spyglass, and why chasing it on the wire finds no packet to handle.
//!
//! **VERIFIED against the 5875 binary** (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/farsight-and-client-control.md`,
//! §5 cross-checked): the aura watcher `0x604d00` routes to `0x5ff350` (add) / `0x612320` (remove);
//! both, **for the local player only** (`0x5fa6d0`), walk the spell's three effects comparing
//! `EffectApplyAuraName[i]` (`SpellRec+0x16c`) against `0x4c` = 76 and call
//! `0x50d320(camera, EffectMiscValue[i])`. That function forces **first person**, sets a camera flag
//! (`|= 0x8`) that makes `SetCameraView` early-return — so the view is *locked* — and writes
//! `[camera+0x40] = n × π/180`. On removal it restores `π/2` and unlocks.
//!
//! So the spyglass is a locked first-person view at a **6× zoom**: `EffectMiscValue = 15` against a
//! stored default of 90.
//!
//! **We copy the ratio, not the number, and that is deliberate.** The reference's `[camera+0x40]`
//! and our [`CAM_FOVY`] are different quantities: theirs defaults to 90°, while ours is the
//! *effective vertical* field of view and is 45° (≈ the reference's measured 44.1°). Writing 15°
//! straight into our projection would be a third again too narrow. `15/90` is exact, dimensionless,
//! and survives whatever our FOV constant is — the same reasoning `camera.rs` uses for the
//! click-travel constants, where copying the reference's raw device units would have bound us to
//! its mouse scaling.
