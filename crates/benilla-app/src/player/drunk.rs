//! Drunkenness — the client-side inebriation math (B210).
//!
//! The server streams a drunk value in `PLAYER_BYTES_3` byte 1
//! ([`benilla_protocol::messages::ObjectFields::player_drunk_byte`]); the reference client turns
//! it into a fraction `min(byte, 100) × 0.01` (`0x5e2a90`, wow-re PRIMITIVE
//! `drunk_fraction_5e2a90`) and, per frame for the **active player while moving**
//! (`flags & 0xf`, the caller band `0x60a984–0x60ab14`), staggers the walk by a wobble angle:
//!
//! - **facing** `+= pulse(now, fraction)` every frame, 2π-wrapped, committed through the normal
//!   facing pipeline (`0x60de30`) — the sign of the pulse oscillates slowly, so the character
//!   veers left and right as it walks. Skipped while a keyboard turn is held (`flags & 0x30`,
//!   non-mouselook) so deliberate turning stays crisp.
//! - **swim pitch** `+= pulse × 4.0` (`_DAT_0080306c`), clamped, while the swim flag is up
//!   (`0x200000`) — a drunk swimmer porpoises.
//!
//! The pulse itself (`0x60ab20`, wow-re PRIMITIVE `cosine_pulse`, diffed bit-exact against the
//! binary) is a 3-harmonic cosine blend whose **amplitude and frequencies both scale with the
//! fraction**: `p = now_ms·(π/180)·f`, `pulse = mean(cos(p·0.093), cos(p·0.154), cos(p·0.195))
//! · (π/240)·f`. At full drunk (fraction 1.0) that is a veer rate peaking near ±0.75°/frame with
//! beat periods of a few seconds; tipsy values scale both the swing and how fast it meanders.
//! The three harmonics never phase-lock, so the stagger reads as aimless, not metronomic.
//!
//! Faithful-arithmetic note: the binary computes on the x87 stack at PC_53 (f64) and rounds to
//! f32 only at explicit stores; the port widens each f32 operand to f64 and rounds back only
//! where the binary stores (the mid-pulse `fst` of the phase is reproduced — the first cosine
//! sees the unrounded phase, the second and third the f32-rounded one). Constants carry the
//! binary's exact bit patterns.
