//! **Land here** — free-fly's missing other half: put the avatar where the camera is.
//!
//! `F` detaches the camera and the avatar freezes ([`super::camera::fly_free`]); the terrain
//! streamer follows the *camera* while detached, so you can fly anywhere and the world loads
//! around you — but there was no way to bring the body along. This is that: fly to a spot, ask to
//! land, and the avatar arrives there. Unreal's eject → possess, in our shape.
//!
//! **The teleport is the server's, not ours.** The ask goes out as the GM command `.go xyz x y z
//! <map>` (vmangos `HandleGoXYZCommand` → `HandleGoHelper`, which keeps the exact Z when one is
//! given and saves the recall position on the way), and the answer comes back as the ordinary
//! `MSG_MOVE_TELEPORT_ACK` this client already handles ([`super::wire_in`]) — so the destination
//! is one the server agrees with, zone/area/grid bookkeeping included, and nothing here invents a
//! pose on the wire. It also means the affordance needs the account's GM rights, which is the
//! default for this project's characters (decision 0679); a refused command shows up as the
//! timeout warning below rather than as silence.
//!
//! Two details worth stating, because both are choices:
//! - **The feet land at the camera point**, not the eye — the camera translation IS the
//!   destination, so you arrive standing where you were floating (a ~2 yd eye rise on arrival).
//! - **Re-attach waits for the teleport**, rather than happening at the ask. Staying detached
//!   through the round trip means the camera is already at the destination while the body flies
//!   to it, so the tiles are resident before the landing instead of streaming in under it.
