//! **The step-up probe** — the instrument that answers "why won't it climb *this* kerb?".
//!
//! The symptom is always the same from outside the window: you walk into something small, the
//! avatar keeps running on the spot, and nothing in the ordinary trace says why — the atomic
//! step-up ([`super::mover::step_up`]) declined, and one of six different reasons is the truth.
//! Reasoning cannot pick between them (0209's whole history is sessions that tried), and neither
//! can a screenshot, so this measures instead:
//!
//! 1. **The blocked frame is detected, not hunted.** A grounded walk frame whose achieved
//!    horizontal displacement is a fraction of what the input asked for *is* the report. No
//!    keybind to remember, no guessing which of the director's frames were the bad ones.
//! 2. **The surface profile ahead is measured** with one-sided down rays at a ladder of forward
//!    offsets: how tall the thing actually is, whether it has a walkable top at all, and — the
//!    reason the rays are one-sided like the mover's own probes — whether that top is even
//!    *visible* to a downward sweep under the 0970 facing law.
//! 3. **The maneuver is re-run at a ladder of advances.** The live step-up advances by this
//!    frame's own travel (0209), which is 12 cm at 60 fps and 3 cm at 240 — while the capsule
//!    radius is [`super::CAPSULE_RADIUS`]. If a rung further out commits where the live one did
//!    not, the advance is the defect; if *every* rung says `NO-FLOOR`, the geometry is; if every
//!    rung says `STEEP-FLOOR`, the walkable gate is. One line, one verdict.
//! 4. **The candidate faces are dumped** ([`benilla_world::collision::WorldCollision::faces_near_body`]), with the
//!    facing gate's own answer per face, when the trace asks for them.
//!
//! Output goes two places: the `stup` tag of `WOW_MOVE_TRACE` (the record we read afterwards) and
//! [`latest`], a small ring the debug panel renders live — so the director can *see* the probe
//! fire at the spot they meant, which is what makes a capture worth reading (method §6).
//!
//! Cost: nothing at all on a frame that moves. On a blocked one it is rate-limited to
//! [`REPORT_HZ`] reports a second, each a handful of shape casts and rays — so leaning on a wall
//! forever cannot turn into a frame-rate story of its own.
