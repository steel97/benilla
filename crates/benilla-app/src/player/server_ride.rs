//! The self-spline ride: when a server-authored spline drives our own player — an `SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE`
//! addressed to our guid — input yields, we ride it out, and we acknowledge `CMSG_MOVE_SPLINE_DONE`
//! so the server hands control back. Warrior **Charge** is the first case (decision 0260); knockback,
//! taxi flight, and fear reuse the same path.
//!
//! The mechanic, pinned live against vmangos: Charge is neither a teleport nor a knockback — the
//! server moves the *caster* with the same `MoveSpline` machinery as any creature (a ground spline at
//! run×4-capped-24 yd/s, facing the target), broadcasts it to the caster too, and for a player mover
//! waits on `CMSG_MOVE_SPLINE_DONE` (the `MovementInfo` at the endpoint + the `splineId`) before it
//! stops treating us as spline-controlled.
//!
//! Division of labour each frame while riding:
//! - [`crate::net`]'s `sample_splines` (Net stage) advances the [`Spline`] into the entity
//!   `Transform` — the horizontal authority for the ride. **Its Z is not authoritative** and never
//!   was (decision 1927): the reference discards a grounded spline's vertical exactly as it does a
//!   creature's, and [`ride_z`] re-derives it from the ground under us.
//! - [`drive_self_ride`] (Input stage, *before* `control`) owns the *whole* pose while the ride
//!   lasts: it mirrors that transform into [`Player`] (`pos`/`face_yaw`/`model_yaw`), drives a
//!   forward-run animation via [`MovementState`], unwinds the strafe counter-twist ([`BodyTwist`]),
//!   and — the frame the spline ends — emits the ack and clears the ride so `control` resumes from
//!   the endpoint at rest.
//! - `control`'s ride guard carries the follow-camera onto the moving avatar and skips input,
//!   physics, and the outbound movement stream.
