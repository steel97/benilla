//! **The camera's smoothed-scalar channel** — the one template the reference instantiates four
//! times, in one place instead of four.
//!
//! wow-re `ui/scratch/camera-cvar-gates.md` §8 is the finding this module exists to honour: the
//! camera's pitch, pitch-bias and ground-tilt channels (`0x512830`/`0x512980`,
//! `0x512a50`/`0x512ba0`, `0x512490`/`0x5125e0`) are **one compiler-emitted template** at three
//! sets of field offsets, and `0x5126b0`/`0x512790` — the pivot **height** channel this client
//! already had ([`super::camera::PivotGlide`]) — is a fourth. Their per-frame step is one block of
//! one function (`0x50f160`).
//!
//! | role | live | start | target | start ms | duration | armed bit | rate CVar |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | pitch | `+0xf4` | `+0x1e4` | `+0x1e0` | `+0x1d8` | `+0x1dc` | `0x2000000` | `cameraPitchSmoothSpeed` `45.0` |
//! | bias | `+0x104` | `+0x1fc` | `+0x1f8` | `+0x1f0` | `+0x1f4` | `0x8000000` | `cameraTargetSmoothSpeed` `90.0` |
//! | ground | `+0x108` | `+0x1b4` | `+0x1b0` | `+0x1a8` | `+0x1ac` | `0x10000000` | `cameraGroundSmoothSpeed` `7.5` |
//! | height | `+0xfc` | `+0x1cc` | `+0x1c8` | `+0x1c0` | `+0x1c4` | `0x20000000` | `cameraHeightSmoothSpeed` `1.2` |
//!
//! The armer's contract, byte-derived and identical at all four: shortest-path-rewrap the live
//! value into `[target − π, target + π]`; **refuse** the request if the channel is already arming
//! the same `{target, delay, factor}` within `0.001`, or if the live value is already within
//! `0.001` of the target; otherwise compute `duration = |target − live| / rate · factor` and hand
//! the tween to the inner. The step is `s = elapsed / duration`, `s ≥ 1` → `live = target`, else
//! the cosine smoothstep `0x5b7bb0` — `a + (b − a)·(1 − cos πs)/2`.
//!
//! **Two things a re-implementation gets wrong.** `+0x1dc`/`+0x1f4`/`+0x1ac`/`+0x1c4` are
//! **durations in seconds**, not rates — the consumer *divides* elapsed seconds by them; and the
//! rate is in the **live value's own units**, so the three angular channels convert their deg/s
//! CVar with `π/180` while the height channel's `1.2` is already yd/s. [`Arm::rate`] is therefore
//! stated in live-units/s and the conversion belongs to the caller, where the unit is known.
//!
//! **The delay is a HOLD here, and the reference's is not** — a named divergence. `0x512830` backs
//! the start time up by `delay` (`now − (int)(p2 · −1000)`), so `0x50f160`'s `s` goes *negative*
//! for that long; and because the profile is `cos(π·s)` — an even function — a negative `s`
//! evaluates the ease as though `|s|`, which makes the live value jump away from `from` at the
//! instant of arming and walk back. That is an unclamped divide, not an intent, and it is
//! unreachable at every default this client reads: `Delay` is `0.0` on all thirty rows of the
//! `cameraTerrainTilt<Style><State>` table, and both the bias and pitch arms pass `0` literally.
//! benilla holds at `from` until the delay elapses — [`super::camera::FollowRig`] already does
//! exactly that for the one family whose delay is genuinely nonzero (`Track`/`Fear` under Smart,
//! `0.4`), so this is the house reading, not a new one.
