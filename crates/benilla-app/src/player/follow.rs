//! `/follow` — the auto-follow movement mode (decisions 0890, 0893).
//!
//! The finding that shapes this module: **follow synthesizes keyboard input.** It owns no
//! translation of its own. Every state change in the reference funnels through the movement
//! singleton's setter (`0x60e790` sets the move-forward bit `0x100000`, `0x60e7f0` clears it) — the
//! same setter the MoveForward keybinding drives, one of ~40 stubs in the keybinding command table
//! at `0x513de0`-`0x514273`. So follow is "hold W for me, and steer", and the right implementation
//! reuses the controller wholesale rather than growing a second mover.
//!
//! It also sends **nothing on the wire** — corroborated against vmangos, which has no follow opcode
//! in 1.12.1. The server only ever sees the ordinary movement stream our synthesized input produces.
//!
//! ## The motion law
//!
//! - **Facing is steered, never snapped** (`0x6103d0`/`0x6108xx`): turn toward the followee at
//!   [`TURN_RATE`] = π rad/s (180°/s), clamped to `min(remaining, rate × elapsed)`, and stop turning
//!   inside a [`TURN_DEADZONE`] of 0.001 rad. That rate limit is why follow *reads* like a character
//!   running rather than a camera snapping.
//! - **Beeline, re-aimed every tick** (`0x610e40`): the guid and both positions are re-resolved every
//!   tick and nothing is cached. No path, no spline — `0x670630` is a *getter* over the click-to-move
//!   order, which follow reads and never writes.
//! - **It never reads the followee's speed** (VERIFIED negative, whole-graph scan). You move at
//!   whatever a held forward key yields for *you*, which is why follow falls behind a faster runner.
//! - **A hysteresis band, not a stop distance** — see [`should_move`]. Arrive is inclusive, resume is
//!   one-directional. The gap between the two is why follow visibly starts and stops rather than
//!   juddering on a single threshold. Arrival does **not** end the follow.
//!
//! ## The cancel set — what actually makes this a *mode*
//!
//! **Every player-initiated movement START cancels the follow, on the key-DOWN edge.** A key
//! *release* never does, and neither does the follow's own synthesized input.
//!
//! The mechanism sits two layers below the keybinding stubs, which is why reading the handlers
//! answers "nothing cancels follow" and is wrong about the behaviour — the same failure mode
//! wow-re's RF-0079 hit on autorun. Every movement START emitter calls **`0x60e990`**, which
//! cancels at `0x60e9b5` unless the re-entrancy bracket `ds:0xc4da48` **bit 0** is set — and
//! follow's own four emitters (`0x60e790`, `0x60e7f0`, `0x60e8a0`, `0x60e940`) set that bracket
//! around their calls. A real key press never sets it. **That asymmetry is the entire mechanism.**
//!
//! We need no bracket of our own, because our synthesized input is [`Player::follow_forward`] — a
//! flag the controller reads, never a key event — so it cannot reach the cancel at all.
//!
//! | action | benilla key | verdict |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | MoveForward / MoveBackward | `W` / `S` | **cancels** (key-DOWN) |
//! | TurnLeft / TurnRight | `A` / `D` | **cancels** (key-DOWN) |
//! | StrafeLeft / StrafeRight | `Q` / `E` | **cancels** (key-DOWN) |
//! | ToggleAutoRun | `MouseButton::Forward` | **cancels**, on the ON edge only |
//! | both-mouse-buttons run | `L`+`R` | **cancels**, on the both-held transition |
//! | mouse-look turning | `R` held | **cancels** while held, however far the mouse moved |
//! | **Jump** | `Space` | **survives** — the one emitter passing `0x60e990(0,0)` (`0x60dea8`) |
//! | Sit / stand | — | **survives** (a `CMSG_STANDSTATECHANGE`, no guard call) |
//! | walk/run toggle | — | **survives** |
//! | any key release | — | **survives** |
//!
//! Plus the non-input cancels: **losing the mover** (death, stun, a taxi hand-off — the reference's
//! second, rarer site at `0x5146d6`), the followee becoming unresolvable or **dying**, and the
//! degenerate-bearing guard below.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! **The ~180° turn-away cancel is drunk-only, and is therefore absent.** 0890 shipped it as an
//! INFERRED rule with a latch invented to make the 160°-220° band self-consistent. The band is
//! real (`0x80c604` = 2.7925267 rad, `0x80c600` = 3.8397243 rad, both strict) — but its whole
//! evaluation is gated at `0x610a3d` on an argument that is the **inebriation fraction**,
//! `min([[unit+0xe68]+0x1d], 100) × 0.01`. That byte is proven to be drunkenness by two independent
//! consumers of the identical expression: the `DRUNK_MESSAGE_SELF%d` formatter at `0x5e2ac3`, and
//! `0x60001a` comparing the same fraction against 0.5 to pick an animation state. **On a sober
//! character the band never executes**, so a client that does not model inebriation must not
//! implement it — and benilla does not. (Its real arming trigger is turn-*convergence*, not "inside
//! the band", with a stochastic disarm at `0x61092e`; recorded for whoever adds drunkenness.)
//!
//! Also refuted by census, each a real "surely this cancels follow?" candidate: taking damage,
//! entering combat, mounting, beginning a cast, and the followee simply going out of range
//! (`0x6107e5` explicitly excludes follow's mode at `0x610749`/`0x610752`).
//!
//! ## The start gate lives elsewhere
//!
//! Who you may begin following — a living, assistable **player**, and only while you are alive,
//! unstunned and not casting — is [`crate::target::by_name`]'s, because that is where the subject
//! is resolved. The refusals it raises are real error lines, not silence.
