//! **The walk/run gait toggle** — the `TOGGLERUN` keybind, the reference's `ToggleRun 0x513d50`.
//!
//! One latched bit ([`Player::walking`]) and one refusal chain, kept here beside its concern like
//! [`super::posture`] and [`super::gait`]. Everything downstream is already built and reads the
//! bit through the ordinary paths: the flag word ([`super::flags`]) carries `MOVEFLAG_WALK_MODE`
//! `0x100` out onto every packet, the speed cascade ([`crate::net::current_speed`]) turns it into
//! `min(MOVE_WALK, MOVE_RUN)`, and the animation selector needs nothing at all — it picks Walk(4)
//! over Run(5) purely on `speed > 2 × walkSpeed`, so a correct speed *is* the correct clip and a
//! correct playback rate (wow-re `rf57-movement-anim-select.md`: "Walk-vs-run is SPEED-driven,
//! NOT the WALK-mode bit").
//!
//! **The one thing the toggle owns that the differ does not**: nothing else in the client would
//! ever announce this. The reference's own move-state broadcaster gates every send on the
//! locomotion nibble (`0x61a99d test al,0xf`), so a toggle pressed while standing still would
//! never reach the server through it — which is exactly why `ToggleRun` enqueues its own move
//! event (`0x513dd2 call 0x60e080` → `0x60e060` → `0x617de0` → `0x617570`, kind `0xf` when the
//! walk bit is currently clear and `0xe` when it is set). Ours goes out of the flag differ in
//! [`super::movement_net`], which is likewise not nibble-gated.

/// 513dc6  cmp byte [descr+0x210],0x7 ; je              →  UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_1.standState == DEAD
/// ```
///
/// `descr+0x40` is `UNIT_FIELD_HEALTH`, not a guess: benilla already byte-pinned it at the
/// reference's own death predicate `0x605f90` ("really dead — `[descr+0x40] <= 0`", see
/// `ObjectFields::unit_reads_dead`), and `descr+0x210` is `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_1` (field index
/// `0x84`), whose byte 0 is the stand state. So the death leg is health-or-standstate — and
/// notably **not** the feign-death dynflag that `unit_reads_dead` also carries, which is why this
/// takes the narrower [`ObjectFields::unit_is_dead`]. A **ghost** is health 1 and stand state 0,
/// so a corpse run may be walked, and the corpse it is running to may not toggle anything.
///
/// The spline gate reads the other way round from how it looks: bit `0x4` of the spline flags is
/// the **finalize / `MOVE_SPLINE_DONE` latch** (wow-re `rf57-movement-anim-select.md`, the FLY
/// gate's `(flags & 0x204) == 0x200`), so "the latch must be set" means *the spline is finished* —
/// i.e. **a mover on a live server spline is refused**. Ours is [`Player::server_riding`]: the
/// taxi flight and the charge/knock hand-offs are the states where a spline is actually flying.
///
/// `0x1200` is two bits and only one of them is settled: `0x1000` is `MOVEFLAG_ROOT`
/// (VERIFIED — `SetRoot 0x7c7340` writes it, wow-re `moveflag-family.md`), and `0x200` is a bit
/// benilla does not model at all. The same pair gates the autorun emitter `0x514560`, where
