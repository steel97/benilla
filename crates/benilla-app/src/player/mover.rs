//! The kinematic mover step — the walk/fall physics and the step-down snap, split out of the
//! `control` system ([`super`] keeps the input/camera/wire glue and the knob table this reads).
//! One call per frame: [`step`].
//!
//! Thin kinematic controller (decision 0009) over the **one-sided** mirror of avian's
//! `MoveAndSlide` (`crate::collision::one_sided`, decision 0970: a face only blocks motion its
//! authored winding opposes, the reference's `0x632700` law) — kept simple and robust on the
//! triangulated heightmap:
//!   - probe down to classify the ground (walkable iff its normal is within ~50° of up);
//!   - "grounded" = on walkable ground AND not rising, so a jump cleanly leaves the ground (and
//!     isn't re-grounded the next frame — the bug that ate most jumps). While airborne the probe
//!     tightens to [`LAND_PROBE`], so the arc ends where the slide actually contacts the floor
//!     rather than snapping the last fraction of a yard (decision 0190);
//!   - grounded → move horizontally only, with NO gravity fed into the slide (gravity-slide was
//!     the downhill creep on micro-sloped terrain), then snap onto the surface to follow it;
//!   - a walkable slope never slows or deflects the walk: the real client's walk is
//!     two-dimensional (speed·dt of *horizontal* distance), so an opposing walkable plane rides
//!     instead of clipping ([`walkable_ride_velocity`]) — full 2D speed on every ≤50° surface;
//!   - a steep face in the way runs the atomic step-up ([`step_up`]): rise–advance–settle onto
//!     a walkable floor, committed whole within the frame or not at all (decision 0209);
//!   - a steep face never *lifts* the mover: when the slide's clip would convert a push into
//!     upward motion, the face clips as a vertical wall instead ([`steep_wall_plane`]) — you
//!     rub along trunks and steep banks, never up them;
//!   - airborne → gravity carries the arc, with a one-shot nudge to steer a standstill jump;
//!   - a fall whose descent stalls (a capsule wedged between steep faces — the
//!     tree-pinch funnel) *lands there*: standing, walking control live, instead of hanging in
//!     the falling pose forever with mid-air control locked (decisions 0211/0212).
