//! The mover's side of the `WOW_MOVE_TRACE` debug trace ([`crate::dbg_trace`]), three tags:
//!
//! - **`move`** — one line per *interesting* frame of the player mover ([`frame`]): a step-down snap,
//!   a grounded flip, an airborne frame, or any sizeable vertical delta — so a movement-feel report
//!   ("it pops when I step off the fence") can be read back as per-frame numbers instead of
//!   re-guessed from watching the screen.
//! - **`swim`** — one line per frame *over liquid* ([`swim`]): the waterline, the feet, the depth
//!   against the two latch thresholds, and which physics regime ran. A water-feel report ("it
//!   jitters at the surface") is a question about the depth signal frame by frame, and no other
//!   tag carries it: `move` is emitted by the walk arm only, so the swim frames of a flapping
//!   latch are exactly the ones it drops (decision 0644).
//! - **`snd`** — one line per outbound `MSG_MOVE_*` ([`sent`]), the send-side twin of `net::motion`'s
//!   `rly`: it makes **our own wire cadence measurable** (decision 0617), which is the only way to
//!   compare it against the reference's — the 1.12.1 sniff's client stream is a list of exactly these
//!   fields, so `grep snd` on a run of mouse-turning and strafing is directly diffable against it.
//!
//! The anim driver writes its own `anim` lines into the same file, on the same clock.
