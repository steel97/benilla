//! **Posture** — the two things the controller does to how the body *holds* itself, as opposed to
//! where it goes: the **stand state** (the `/sit` family and the `X` key) and the **sheath**
//! toggle (`Z`). One module because they are one mechanism in the reference and they interlock
//! here: entering a stand state ∉ {0 STAND, 2 SIT_CHAIR} force-stows drawn weapons through the
//! same anim-layer setter the `Z` key drives, and the sheath toggle's own guard chain refuses on
//! the stand state this frame just committed.
//!
//! Both halves are **silent-refusal** mechanisms — the reference builds no packet and says
//! nothing when a press is rejected — which is why the stand half writes the `sit` trace tag
//! ([`super::move_trace::posture`]) at every commit *and* every refusal: on screen a granted sit
//! and a refused one are the same picture (decisions 0080, 0881; bug B155).
