//! Player **swim mode** — the water-movement regime the ground mover ([`super::mover`]) can't express:
//! when the water gets deep enough the avatar leaves the floor, floats, and swims in 3D along its
//! pitched facing, instead of walking the lakebed. Setting [`Player::swimming`] here is what lights
//! the swim gaits ([`crate::creature_anim`] ids 41–45) for the local player and streams
//! `MOVEFLAG_SWIMMING` (+ the pitch tail) on the wire (the decision-0052 swim follow-up).
//!
//! The enter/exit boundary is **VERIFIED** against the real client (wow-re
//! `collision/scratch/swim-transition.md`, resolving benilla-pins **B7**): the per-frame local decision
//! `0x6030c0` fires `MOVEFLAG_SWIMMING 0x00200000` off `depth = liquidSurface − feetZ` vs a fraction of
//! the unit's collision height, with a genuine 1/36-yd hysteresis band (see [`swim_enter_depth`]).
//! There is **no** separate wade/water movement flag (`0x40000000` is HOVER — wading is just the
//! implicit in-liquid-below-threshold state).
//!
//! The **vertical law is VERIFIED** (the swim §5's TU-B, wow-re `swim-mechanism.md`, superseding the
//! earlier surface-follow reading): while SWIMMING the mover routes through the client's *floating*
//! resolver, which **bypasses gravity entirely** — an idle swimmer's depth is **frozen** (no sink, no
//! rise, no ease), the vertical comes only from the pitched travel velocity, and the one constraint is
//! a **hard top-cap at `surface − 0.75·collisionHeight`** (`0x632ba0` ×0.75): the feet can never be
//! shallower than the resting waterline, so a surfacing swimmer stops ~three-quarters submerged, head
//! out. That cap constrains the **position, both ways** — wow-re's Q5 states it as "feet cannot come
//! shallower than `surface − 0.75·collisionHeight`", a hard clamp re-tested each active substep — and
//! what leaves a *stroking* swimmer above the line is usually not a rise but the surface **descending**
//! under them, which is why the constraint has to be re-satisfied and not merely guarded against
//! ([`settle_to_rest`], decision 0644). It is still no spring and no resting *seek* — the old
//! `REST_SUBMERSION`/`BUOYANCY_RATE` ease is gone, and a swimmer *below* the line is never pulled up.
//! Reaching the cap does NOT bleed the stroke off: the capped rise redirects **level, at full
//! speed** — surface swimming — and the presented pitch levels with it ([`cap_redirect`],
//! decisions 0499+0505). This is a **named divergence**: the §5 (wow-re
//! `swim-topcap-velocity.md`) found the exe's own-input resolver GRINDS a steep aim at the
//! cap (`0x634640` tangential re-sweep, no renormalization) — which contradicts the
//! director-confirmed ref behavior — and its only leveling regime (travel-derived
//! `asin(dir.z)` pitch) belongs to spline/CTM movers and would be overwritten per-frame by
//! the 0492 mouselook direct-set. The redirect is benilla's construction reproducing the
//! validated feel, kept until wow-re's live capture pins the real surface law (0505).
//!
//! The one way OUT through the top is the **swim jump** ([`breach_step`], TU-B(f)+TU-F
//! `0x7c6230`): jump clears SWIMMING unconditionally and launches the walk mover's FALLING arc at
//! [`SWIM_JUMP_SPEED`] — the breach hop. Re-entry is the same depth check plus the verified fall
//! gate `0x7c5de0` — swim re-latches once the upward velocity has decayed to half the launch
//! value, discarding the residual (see [`update_swimming`]).
//!
//! **Space maps to the ref's Jump routing, at any depth, one hop per PRESS** (decisions
//! 0487 + 0498): a swimming press fires the jump-exit wherever it happens — at the surface it
//! breaches out; submerged it's the ~1.6-yd dolphin-hop — and a held key does NOT re-fire
//! after the re-latch (director-verified on the ref; the byte gate behind that is an open
//! wow-re question, see 0498). The way to RISE is aiming up with the right mouse and swimming
//! forward — the ref's own mouselook→SetPitch mechanism, **VERIFIED** (wow-re
//! `swim-camera-pitch.md`, decision 0492).
