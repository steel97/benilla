//! Outbound self-movement → the wire — the mirror of [`crate::net::motion`] (which integrates *remote*
//! movers). [`stream_self_movement`] diffs this frame's CMovement move-flags against last frame's and
//! emits a `MSG_MOVE_*` per movement-*axis* transition (start/stop forward-back, strafe, turn), the
//! jump/fall lifecycle (JUMP launch, FALL_LAND — a jumpless fall opens with nothing, decision 1464),
//! a periodic heartbeat while moving,
//! and a SET_FACING every frame the facing changes off the turn axis — each carrying the live
//! `MovementInfo` (decisions 0052 + 0053 + 0617). Split out of the controller: the wire stream is its
//! own concern.
//!
//! **Invariant — the wire mirrors the avatar's *actual* local motion** (decision 0056). vmangos relays
//! what we send verbatim and observers extrapolate it from the moveFlags, so any divergence strands them
//! on stale state: a flag we set but never clear is a *phantom* walk/spin, and an out-of-range value is
//! silently dropped before relay (vmangos rejects `|orientation| > 4π` in `VerifyMovementInfo`,
//! regardless of anticheat). Three rules keep us honest, all enforced here at the wire boundary:
//! - **Every outbound `orientation` is normalized into `[0, 2π)`** — `face_yaw`/`cam.yaw` are unbounded
//!   accumulators, but the real client always sends a normalized facing and the server's validity gate
//!   demands it.
//! - **When the controller stops driving locomotion, the mover is *parked*** — [`park_mover`] flushes a
//!   Stop and clears our flags on entering free-fly; the held frames of a post-teleport settle stream
//!   zeroed flags (so [`stream_self_movement`]'s own diff emits the Stop) — so observers never
//!   extrapolate motion that isn't happening locally.
//! - **The server's copy of our *position* may never go stale** — the reconcile at the bottom of
//!   [`stream_self_movement`] (decision 0907). A resting body whose resolver settles it a fraction
//!   of a millimetre after the packet that reported the rest used to keep that to itself, and
//!   vmangos — which compares positions with exact float equality — read the next packet's
//!   accumulated delta as movement and cancelled the cast in flight. Drift at rest is news; it goes
//!   out the frame it happens.
