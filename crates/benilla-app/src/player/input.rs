//! **This frame's decoded input**, in one place — the two things the controller derives from the
//! keyboard, the mouse and the binding table before any of it means anything to the avatar:
//!
//! - [`look_input`] — the both-button state and the reference's own **camera command word**
//!   (1.12's `[InputControl+0x4]`, decision 1502), which the auto-follow is armed by. Read
//!   *before* the look session, because both camera seats want it — including the one on the
//!   not-driving path, which returns before the axes below are ever computed.
//! - [`move_axes`] — the **netted** forward/back and strafe axes plus the modes that select
//!   between them (mouselook, keyboard turn), and the autorun latch with its cancel set. Netted
//!   once here so that the direction we move, the speed we pick, the swim amounts and the flags we
//!   stream can never disagree (decision 0056).
//!
//! Nothing here touches the avatar: `move_axes` writes exactly one field ([`Player::autorun`]),
//! because the autorun latch *is* input state.
