//! The **five camera views** — `SetView` / `SaveView` / `ResetView` / `NextView` / `PrevView`, and
//! `FlipCameraYaw`. The engine half of [`benilla_ui::script::CameraViewRequest`]; the Lua half (and
//! the argument ABI) is `benilla-ui`'s `script::camera_view`.
//!
//! [`super::camera_saved`]'s neighbour, and its complement: that file remembers the **one live
//! pose** per character; this one remembers the **five named poses** the player can jump between.
//! The reference splits them exactly the same way and for the same reason — one is where you left
//! the camera, the other is where you decided it should be able to go.
//!
//! # The five views, byte-real
//!
//! The reference's camera ctor reads the `cameraView` CVar and indexes a five-row table of default
//! *strings* at `0x84f488` (stride 12, three `const char*` per row — distance, pitch, yaw), with
//! the row names at `0x84f848`. Read straight out of `WoW.exe` 5875 (decision 1138 §2 records the
//! first two columns; the third is dumped here for the first time):
//!
//! | `SetView` arg | internal | name | distance | pitch | yaw |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | 1 | 0 | `FIRST_PERSON`   | `0.0`   | `0.0`  | `0.0` |
//! | 2 | 1 | `THIRD_PERSON_A` | `5.55`  | `10.0` | `0.0` |
//! | 3 | 2 | `THIRD_PERSON_B` | `5.55`  | `20.0` | `0.0` |
//! | 4 | 3 | `THIRD_PERSON_C` | `13.88` | `30.0` | `0.0` |
//! | 5 | 4 | `THIRD_PERSON_D` | `13.88` | `10.0` | `0.0` |
//!
//! The pitch column is **degrees, positive = looking DOWN** — the reference's own convention, which
//! is the opposite of [`FlyCam::pitch`]'s. Decision 1138 is the whole story; the conversion is
//! [`super::camera_saved::pitch_from_file`] and this module does not grow a second one.
//!
//! View 1 is `distance 0.0`, and that is **reachable, not a rounding of "very close"**:
//! [`CAM_DIST_MIN`] is `0.0`, the eye sits on the framing pivot (inside the head) and the avatar
//! fades out through [`benilla_world::model_fade::self_model_fade_alpha`]. `SetView(1)` is real
//! first person, not a clamp to some near stop.
//!
//! # Persistence — the reference's own fifteen CVars
//!
//! 1138 §2 recorded that the saved views survive a restart as archived `config.wtf` CVars and left
//! the name→view mapping unpinned. It is pinned now, at `0x50b9b0`'s 5x3 registration loop, and the
//! names are the reference's:
//!
//! ```text
//! 50b9c1  SStrCopy(buf, 0x84fdc0)              ; "camera"
//! 50b9d3  SStrCat (buf, [esi+0x84f468])        ; "Distance" | "Pitch" | "Yaw"   (inner, esi 0..12)
//! 50b9e1  SStrCat (buf, [ebx])                 ; ""  | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D"    (outer, per view)
//! 50b9ec  default = [esi + edi + 0x84f488]     ; the SAME table as the ctor's, 12·view + 4·field
//! 50ba07  record  -> [esi + edi + 0xbe0f7c]
//! ```
//!
//! → `cameraDistance`/`cameraPitch`/`cameraYaw` for view 0, and `…A`/`…B`/`…C`/`…D` for views 1–4;
//! the active view is `cameraView` (`0x84fdc8`, registrar default `"1"` — an *internal* index, so
//! the shipped view is `THIRD_PERSON_A`, i.e. Lua `SetView(2)`). Verified by reading the tables out
//! of the binary, not inferred from the loop shape. benilla registers exactly those sixteen names
//! with exactly those defaults ([`crate::cvars::REGISTERED`], welded by test below) — 0954's CVar
//! store *is* our persistence, so being faithful here costs nothing and buys a `config.toml` a
//! player can read against a real `config.wtf`.
//!
//! **No host knob** — the `lastCharacterIndex`/`checkAddonVersion` posture in [`crate::cvars`]:
//! [`CameraViews`] is the authority, seeded once from the persisted values at startup and writing
//! every change back through `set_cvar_engine` (the minimap-zoom pattern, so the write dirties
//! `config.toml`). A live `SetCVar("cameraPitchB", …)` therefore does *not* reach the in-memory
//! slot — which is the reference's behaviour too: `0x50fb80` loads the slot array from the CVar
//! records at camera construction and nothing re-reads them afterwards.
//!
//! # Three things the reference does that a reader will expect it not to
//!
//! - **`SaveView(1)` and `ResetView(1)` work.** All three indexed entry points take `1..=5`
//!   (`0x50b5d2`/`0x50b626`/`0x50b666`: `test eax,eax; jle` then `cmp eax,5; jg`), and `0x50fa30`
//!   — SaveView's body — has no view-0 gate. 1.12 ships no `SAVEVIEW1`/`RESETVIEW1` *binding*,
//!   which is a `Bindings.xml` decision; a macro reaches what no key can.
//! - **`NextView`/`PrevView` do not wrap.** `0x50faa0` is `eax = view + 1; cmp eax,5; jge <ret>`,
//!   `0x50fac0` is `test eax,eax; jle <ret>; dec eax`. Holding `END` walks 1→2→3→4→5 and stops.
//! - **The saved yaw is an OFFSET from the subject's facing, not a world angle.** The reference's
//!   yaw channel `cam+0xf0` is relative while `cam+0xa4 == 0` and the final view resolver re-adds
//!   the followed unit's facing every frame (`0x50f7f2`); `0x512e90` adds it explicitly on the
//!   absolute-mode leg (`0x512fff`). Ours stores `wrap_pi(cam.yaw − face_yaw)` for the same reason.
//!
//! # The active view is remembered, and not applied at startup
//!
//! [`load_saved_views`] seeds [`CameraViews`] and stops — it never calls [`apply`]. So a
//! `cameraView` of `2` means "`NextView` steps from there", not "open the camera at view 2"; the
//! pose you actually get is the one [`super::camera_saved`] restores, which is where you left the
//! camera. That is not a divergence in *effect*: the reference builds its camera from
//! `cameraView`'s row at construction and then `camera-settings.txt`'s reader lands distance and
//! pitch over the top of it at UI load (1138), so the remembered pose wins there too. It is stated
//! because the two modules are neighbours and a reader will otherwise expect them to fight.
//!
//! # Two deliberate divergences, both stated
//!
//! - **`ResetView` writes the CVars back to their defaults; the reference does not.** `0x50fae0`
//!   re-parses the default strings into the slot array and re-applies the view, and touches no
//!   CVar — so in the real client a reset comes *back* at the next launch, out of the value
//!   `SaveView` archived. Here the CVar store is the persistence (0954), so a reset that does not
//!   persist is a bug rather than a quirk worth aping; writing the default string verbatim also
//!   makes [`crate::cvars`]'s diff-shaped file drop the key entirely.
//! - **`SetView` glides the distance and snaps pitch and yaw.** The reference arms all three of its
//!   smooth channels (`0x513189`/`0x5131a3`/`0x5131b8`, on `cameraViewBlendStyle`'s default `1`).
//!   benilla's rig has exactly one such channel — the wheel-zoom glide at `cameraDistanceMoveSpeed`
//!   — and setting `target_distance` rides it for free; there is no pitch or yaw channel to arm, so
//!   those land immediately. A second and a third channel is a real piece of work and a *look*
//!   call; it is named here rather than half-built.
