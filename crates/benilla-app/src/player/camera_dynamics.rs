//! **The 1.12 camera option toggles** — the four `UIOptionsFrame` checkboxes `FOLLOW_TERRAIN` /
//! `HEAD_BOB` / `SMART_PIVOT` / `WATER_COLLISION` and the mechanisms behind them (decision 2149).
//!
//! Each is a CVar the reference registers and this client ticked at nothing: the census in
//! `ui_script::options_tests` had all four on its unbacked list with a byte-level spec and no
//! feature. wow-re's `ui/scratch/camera-cvar-gates.md` (the §5 nine-worker round this work
//! dispatched, 2026-09-09) carries the gates; `camera-smooth-style.md` §9 and `camera-shake-law.md`
//! carry the kernels they gate.
//!
//! **The sign convention is the one thing to keep straight.** The reference's pitch is positive
//! **downward** (`follow-camera.md` Q3: `row 0 = (cos y·cos p, sin y·cos p, −sin p)`, `eye =
//! pivot − dist·forward`, so `+89°` is the eye above the target looking down). benilla's
//! [`super::camera::FlyCam::pitch`] is a Bevy `EulerRot::YXZ` X-rotation with `forward = rot ·
//! −Z`, so **positive is upward** — the exact negation. Every reference predicate below is
//! therefore transcribed with its comparison flipped, and the flip is written out at each site
//! rather than hidden in a conversion, because a silently mirrored inequality is the failure mode
//! this file exists to avoid.

/// hit pulled back `5/18`; then a `64/9` drop straight down from wherever that landed. The `5/3`
/// is a probe LIFT, added going in and cancelled coming out, so the whole thing reduces to
/// `slope = (groundY_ahead − feet.y) / horizontal_run` — rise over run, ahead of you. A missed
/// horizontal ray means the full reach; a missed drop means `−64/9`, a slope of about `−1.78`,
/// which the staircase and the clamp turn into the full downward tilt: **walking off a cliff edge
/// pitches the camera all the way down**, which is the behaviour and not an accident. Throttled to
/// 100 ms, and on a throttled frame the previous value STANDS (`0x50d956 js` leaves `[cam+0xa0]`
/// alone) — only a failed gate zeroes it.

/// **The staircase (`0x808a40`), which is not a curve.** Ten `{key, angle}` records walked
/// *downward* from index 9, taking the first `|slope| >= key` — a nearest-below step with no
/// interpolation. The keys are `round(tan(5k°), 2)` and the angles `5k°`; but the ±20° clamp that
/// follows equals record 4 exactly, and the table has one consumer image-wide, so **records 5–9
/// are unreachable** and the shipped map is five steps: `0 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 20°` at
/// `|slope| >= 0 / 0.09 / 0.18 / 0.27 / 0.36`. Uphill is a NEGATIVE angle in the reference, i.e.
/// the camera looks up — which is `+` here (module doc).
///
/// **The arm (`0x50dbc0`)**, which is where `cameraSmoothStyle` gets a second job: a 10-state
/// movement classifier indexes a `style × state` matrix of `{Absorb, Delay, Factor}`, the probe's
