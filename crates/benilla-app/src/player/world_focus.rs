//! **The game's half of 1160's wire (a) and the settle release** — what the world is told, and
//! what the game does with what the world publishes back.
//!
//! The terrain streamer used to read `player::Player` directly (where the avatar is, whether it is
//! settled) and write it back (lifting the post-snap hold when the destination's colliders
//! arrived). Both directions are the engine reaching across the line: a world renderer cannot
//! depend on a game's avatar type, and `benilla-worldview` proved the point by having to stub one.
//!
//! Inverted, it is two systems and no shared type:
//!
//! - [`publish_view_focus`] answers the world's one question — *where should I stream from* —
//!   ahead of the stream stage. The viewer with no avatar (a capture run, the world viewer)
//!   answers `ViewFocus::camera()` and needs nothing else.
//! - [`release_post_snap_hold`] reads the residency the world publishes and decides when the
//!   mover's hold ends. The *decision* is the game's; the *fact* is the world's. That split is why
//!   decision 0737's law survives the move intact — the hold still ends on residency and never on
//!   ground contact, and every mover mode still releases the same way, because there is still
//!   exactly one place that does it.
