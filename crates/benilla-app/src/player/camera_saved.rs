//! The **camera pose** the client remembers (decision 1131) — orbit distance and pitch, per
//! character. The fourth resident of 0954's folder to be character-scoped, and the smallest: two
//! floats.
//!
//! The reference keeps exactly these two, in `WTF/Account/<ACC>/<REALM>/<CHAR>/camera-settings.txt`
//! — read out of a real 26-character tree (decision 1128's persistence-surface map):
//!
//! ```text
//! cameraDistance 16.068569
//! cameraPitch 13.449968
//! ```
//!
//! Two keys, LF, six decimals, trailing newline — VERIFIED at the writer (`0x50c4d0`) and reader
//! (`0x50c5a0`), decision 1138. **No yaw**: the live heading is never persisted anywhere. (The
//! `SaveView(2..5)` custom views *are* persisted, but as archived `config.wtf` CVars —
//! `cameraYaw`/`cameraYawA..D` and their Distance/Pitch — not in this file. 1131 §3 said otherwise;
//! 1138 corrects it. benilla has no `SaveView`, so nothing is owed here yet.)
//!
//! benilla writes the same two keys in the same order to
//! `benilla-config/camera/<realm>-<character>.txt` ([`crate::local_state::camera_character_path`]) — a file
//! that stays readable beside its ancestor.
//!
//! **Character-scoped, deliberately.** It is where the reference puts it, and it is what the setting
//! means: a gnome and a tauren want different zooms, and a tank and a healer want different pitches.
//! (The minimap's zoom, the other half of 1131, is install-scoped for the same reason the reference
//! makes it a CVar: it is about the map widget, not the character in front of it.)
//!
//! **Written at the session edges** — `OnExit(InWorld)` (a `/logout`, a disconnect) and `AppExit`
//! (quit) — the same two edges the saved variables use ([`crate::ui_saved`]), and the same posture
//! the reference has for its caches: no autosave, no dirty bit. A camera pose is a thing you settle
//! into once and leave; there is nothing an intermediate write would preserve. The reference's write
//! set is the UI-shutdown root set at `0x490bd0`, which is *wider* than ours — it also fires on
//! `/reload`, `/console reloadUI` and a UI-scale change, each of which then reads the file straight
//! back (1138). benilla has no UI reload, so there is no edge here to miss; when one lands it joins
//! this list.
//!
//! **Read once**, when the roster names the character we are entering the world as — the macro/
//! binding load's own seam ([`crate::ui_macro::identity`]). Absent file = the shipped defaults, which
//! is the normal first run.
