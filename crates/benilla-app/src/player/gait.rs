/// Advance `model_yaw` (the rendered body heading) one frame and return the **animation's** view of
/// the move flags (the wire keeps the real key flags — observers integrate the facing from them):
///
///  · **strafing** — the root turns to `face_yaw ± 90°` (pure) / `± 45°` (diagonal, mirrored
///    when backpedaling), eased a quarter of the remaining gap per frame **in aim-relative
///    offset space** (a left↔right flip is an exact 180° tie in absolute yaw — offset space
///    always swings it around the front); the SpineLow/Head counter-twist walks the upper
///    body back so the head keeps looking at the aim.
///  · **moving fwd/back or airborne** — snap to the aim (the client's `flags & 0x2003` snap;
///    a backpedal keeps facing forward and plays WalkBackwards).
///  · **standing** — the FROZEN chase (byte rule, wow-re `b947e5aa`): while the aim is being
///    steered (A/D turn keys or mouse-look) the catch-up is off and only the 90° ceiling
///    applies — the camera/aim and the head-twist lead while the body holds, then the body
///    follows the turn lagging exactly 90°; once the steering stops it sweeps back onto the
///    aim at 8× the turn rate (~63 ms for 90°). The lag mechanism is the freeze, not a slow
///    rate — the client stamps its chase clock every non-steering frame.
///  · **swimming** ignores the ground display-facing pose (no strafe body-offset, no standing
///    chase): the body SNAPs to the aim (the client's facing snap list — dead or swimming) and
///    the swim *pitch* tilts it in `control`'s transform write (TU-A's render law).
///
/// The turn-in-place foot-shuffle rides the BODY's actual rotation (the client's chase-step bits
/// `0x800/0x1000`, cleared each frame after the anim layer reads them) — NOT the turn keys: while
/// the frozen chase holds the body under a leading head, the feet hold too, and a stationary
/// MOUSE turn shuffles once the body steps (no key flag involved). A deck turning under the rider
/// carries `model_yaw` rigidly at the ride block, so it never registers as a body step here —
/// the shuffle (and its keyframed step sounds) only ever sees real turns (decision 0458/0466).
// The eighth parameter arrived with the possessed mover's own turn rate (1278) and clippy's
// default bound is seven. These are one frame of mover state, each read from a different one of
// the caller's queries — bundling them into a struct would name nothing the call site does not
// already say, and the gate is `-D warnings`, so the honest move is to say why, here.
