//! **The water corridor** — `cameraWaterCollision`'s *other* consumer, and the reason the option is
//! atomic.
//!
//! One CVar read at `0x50e5ec` produces one register, and that register has **two** consumers:
//!
//! * `esi`'s `0xf0000` nibble rides the trace mask to all three of `0x50e570`'s queries, so the
//!   camera boom hits a bare waterline ([`benilla_world::collision`]); and
//! * `0x50e629 test esi,0xf0000` admits the **floor/cap block** transcribed here, which re-bases the
//!   framing pivot against the waterline *before* the boom's origin is built from it (`0x50e786`).
//!
//! **Shipping either half alone is a visible defect, and this client has now shipped each once.**
//! 2149 built the corridor without the trace and put a discontinuity on screen; 2170 built the trace
//! without the corridor and pinned the camera to the waterline, because a surface swimmer's framing
//! pivot sits 11 mm *under* the water plane and the boom then straddles it every frame (2173 §1).
//! The floor is what lifts the sweep origin clear — to `surface + 2/9` — so the boom never starts
//! near the plane. Neither half is optional; see [`corridor`].
//!
//! Transcribed from wow-re `ui/scratch/camera-water-corridor-spec.md` §1–§4 and §7 (a two-round §5:
//! seven cold workers, byte arbitration on the `(live, target)` polarity, and a rate sweep of the
//! verified loop). Constants: `[0x8089cc] = 5/6`, `[0x8089d0] = 2/9`, `[0x8089d4] = 5/9`,
//! `[0x808a04] = 1/9`.
//!
//! **§5 · The two catch-up blocks, named and NOT built** (`camera-catchup-blocks.md`).
//!
//! `0x50eeb0` (pivot height) and `0x50ee5d` (distance) are a matched pair that pull a live channel
//! down when it has drifted more than `1/9` above what the solver just produced:
//! `live > H + 1/9` strictly (equality and NaN skip), then a **hard store** of `H + 1/9 + 2⁻²⁰`
//! into the live field, plus an ease start at that value with duration **`2.0` s** — and the
//! channel's *target* deliberately left alone, so the ease walks back to where the camera was
//! always headed. Both can only ever decrease their field: `0x50e8bf` caps the arm at
//! `[cam+0xec]`, so `live − H ≥ 0` always, and no mirror block exists.
//!
//! **They are absent together, on purpose.** Three reasons, in order of weight:
//!
//! 1. **They are one mechanism, not two.** `ecx = 2.0f` — the duration for *both* — is loaded once
//!    at `0x50ee63`, inside the DISTANCE block's predicate. Lifting `0x50eeb0` alone stores
//!    garbage for its duration. This module's entire history is shipping one half of a pair
//!    (2149, 2170, 2173); a spec that opens by warning against it gets taken at its word.
//! 2. **Neither is gated on `cameraWaterCollision`** — control reaches them on two edges with no
//!    band bit, CVar or mode flag read anywhere in `0x50eeb0`–`0x50eef8`. They are general camera
//!    behaviour that this option merely *exposes*, and the distance twin changes what zoom does
//!    after any collision, on land as much as in water. That is its own change to a hot path,
//!    with its own gate to earn.
//! 3. Their only effect here is on the corridor's **upper** edge, and it makes an already-small
//!    artifact smaller. The lower edge — the one you can actually see — is unaffected: the eye is
//!    stored at `0x50ede5` before either block runs.
//!
//! Also underived, and flagged rather than guessed: whether the followed object's `z` is swept or
//! pinned entering the submerge band. `CMovement::UpdateLiquid` (`0x6a7650`) hands the physics step
//! a plane at exactly `z = liquidSurfaceZ`, which rules out a fixed offset but does not settle it,
//! and it sits in unresolved tension with the `0x610520` buoyancy equilibrium `|depth − 0.75h| <
//! 0.001`. This client builds the pinned reading.
