//! **Riding a transport** — the boat/zeppelin/tram platform frame (decision 0438 phase 2, widened
//! by 0470's solid cargo). Three acts, in the order the controller runs them:
//!
//! 1. [`carry`] — *before* any input integrates, recompose the rider from the deck's THIS-frame
//!    pose. The deck's motion carries a standing player and its yaw delta turns the whole rider
//!    assembly with it.
//! 2. [`update_attachment`] — *after* the mover has stepped, decide whether we are still aboard,
//!    and re-snapshot the deck-local pose the next frame's [`carry`] recomposes from.
//! 3. The `ride` **trace** tag, emitted inside (2) because it needs the same three reads. The
//!    deck's own motion lives in the boat's transform and the rider's in world space; the
//!    difference between them is the only thing that says whether the carry composed, and no other
//!    instrument records it.

    // per-frame yaw delta turns them with it (applied incrementally so it composes with whatever
    // mouse-look already wrote to `face_yaw` this frame). A despawned boat (streamed out) detaches
    // into an ordinary fall from the last world pose.

    // The carry is rigid for the WHOLE rider — aim (`face_yaw`), rendered body (`model_yaw`), and
    // camera (`cam.yaw`) take the same delta, all HERE. Carrying only the aim leaves the standing
    // body-chase to close the gap frame after frame, and that chase-step is exactly what latches
    // the turn-in-place foot-shuffle (whose keyframes fire step sounds): a sailing boat's spline
    // yaw drifts continuously, so the rider shuffled and clacked the whole voyage (director,
    // 2026-07-17). The deck turning under you is not you turning — the chase and its shuffle only
    // see input turns.
    //
    // The camera's share is unconditional — a deck turn is FRAME motion, not an input turn, so it
    // never routes through `seat_camera`'s look-session gate (that gate protects the camera from
    // *keyboard* turns while a drag owns it). Routing it there was the right-drag drift bug
    // (director, 2026-07-18): during a look session the gate ate the camera's share, and the
    // right-drag coupling `face_yaw = cam.yaw` (which runs first next frame) then yanked the aim
    // back to the world-fixed camera — undoing the deck carry, so with the mouse still the scene
    // swung across the screen and the rider visibly spun against the deck. Carrying all three here
    // keeps the drag's orbit offset (`cam.yaw − face_yaw`) exactly as the hand left it while the
    // whole rider assembly turns with the boat — the reference's camera rides the transport-local
    // player rig the same way.
