//! **What the client embodies** — which single unit it simulates, animates from input, and streams.
//!
//! Decision 0092 gave this client two answers to "where am I?": the **camera eye** and the
//! **active-player character**. Possession forces a third, and the reference has had it all along
//! as its own global: the **active mover** (`ds:0xc4da98`, written only by `SetActiveMover
//! 0x6006e0`), which the input applier `0x514640` resolves at the top of every tick and *skips the
//! whole tick* when it does not resolve. The three are genuinely independent stores there — the
//! camera never consults the mover to pick its anchor, and neither of them touches "the active
//! player" (`ds:0xb41414`), which is invariant under both far sight and possession (VERIFIED,
//! wow-re `object-layer/scratch/farsight-and-client-control.md` §9).
//!
//! So benilla splits the *markers*, not the identity. [`SelfPlayer`] keeps meaning **my character**
//! — bags, auras, quest log, paper doll, the name over the head — and never moves. [`Embodied`]
//! means **the body I am attached to** (the reference's camera anchor, `camera+0x88`) and
//! [`ActiveMover`] means **the body I may move** (those mover globals). Of ~150 `SelfPlayer` query
//! sites the large majority are identity and are untouched by possession; the ones that changed are
//! exactly those that simulate, animate from input, render the body the camera is inside, or
//! stream it.
//!
//! Three properties of the placement carry the weight:
//!
//! - **Attached is not allowed to move** (decision 1281). A control update that forbids a body does
//!   not detach us from it: [`Embodied`] stays and only [`ActiveMover`] comes off. That is the
//!   reference's own shape — `0x5fa600` zeroes the mover globals and never touches the camera
//!   anchor, so the camera goes on following your feared body, merely smoothed (wow-re
//!   `object-layer/scratch/control-loss-and-restore.md` §2/§3). Collapsing the two cost more than
//!   the camera: the self-spline ride hangs off attachment, and with it the
//!   `CMSG_MOVE_SPLINE_DONE` vmangos arms a wait for at every spline launch for a
//!   player-or-player-possessed unit (`MoveSplineInit::Launch`), dropping **every** movement packet
//!   until it arrives (`HandleMovementOpcodes`). A client that detaches while feared is frozen
//!   server-side long after the fear ends.
//! - **Unresolvable is nobody, never a fallback.** A claimed grant whose object has not streamed in
//!   leaves the marker unplaced, because the alternative — quietly leaving it on our own body —
//!   drives our body under the creature's mover, and outbound `MSG_MOVE_*` carry no guid: the
//!   server writes our pose onto the creature. That is the sharpest trap in this family (decision
//!   1269 §3), and here it is structurally impossible rather than guarded against.
//! - **The reins change hands by GUID, not by entity.** A cross-map worldport despawns and
//!   re-streams our own body under a fresh entity while we never stop driving it, so keying the
//!   handover on the entity would re-seize (and re-settle) on every zone transfer.
