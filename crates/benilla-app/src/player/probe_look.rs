//! `WOW_PROBE_LOOK` — the scripted **mouse-turn**, the one player action the probe harness could not
//! synthesize (decision 0621).
//!
//! `WOW_PROBE_KEY` presses keys, which is enough for the transition opcodes; but since decision 0617
//! the busiest thing on our wire by far is the facing stream a *mouse* turn produces (~one packet per
//! frame). A defect that only shows up under that density — and the runaway hunt looks like exactly
//! that — could not be reproduced headlessly at all: an agent had to ask the director to drive, every
//! iteration. That is the tooling gap this closes.
//!
//! Format: `WOW_PROBE_LOOK="<deg_per_sec>@<start_s>:<duration_s>[;…]"`, e.g. `"90@20:6"` — turn the
//! avatar's aim 90°/s for six seconds starting twenty seconds in. Negative rates turn the other way.
//! It writes [`Player::face_yaw`] directly rather than faking `AccumulatedMouseMotion` + a held right
//! button: the camera's look session gates on the OS cursor being inside the viewport
//! (`cursor_in_viewport`), which is unreliable for an unfocused probe window, and the camera plumbing
//! is not what is under test. From `face_yaw` onward this is the identical path a real mouse-turn
//! takes — the same value `stream_self_movement` diffs to decide on a `MSG_MOVE_SET_FACING`.
