//! Player-facing **video settings** — the knobs that reach the window and the presentation path.
//!
//! Two, both of them 1.12's own CVars over the Graphics page: **Display Mode** (`gxWindow`, the
//! *Display Mode* row) and **VSync** (`gxVSync`, the *Vertical Sync* row).
//!
//! # Display mode — the reference's CVar, deliberately not the reference's meaning (decision 1627)
//!
//! 1.12 ships a **two-state** display model: `gxWindow "0"` takes the display with an exclusive
//! mode-set at `gxResolution`, `gxWindow "1"` runs in a window (with `gxMaximize` for a maximized
//! one). We keep the CVar, the row, and the default; we redefine `"0"`.
//!
//! **`"0"` here means BORDERLESS fullscreen** — a normal window sized to the monitor, flagged
//! fullscreen to the compositor (`xdg_toplevel.set_fullscreen` on Wayland,
//! `_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN` on X11, a native fullscreen window on macOS). We ship no exclusive
//! mode at all, and that is not a shortcut — it is unavailable or pointless on all three targets:
//!
//! - **Wayland has no client-side mode-setting**, so there is nothing to implement: winit 0.30.13
//!   answers `Fullscreen::Exclusive` with ``warn!("`Fullscreen::Exclusive` is ignored on Wayland")``
//!   and leaves the window as it was (`platform_impl/linux/wayland/window/mod.rs:147,488`).
//! - **On X11 it is XRandR mode-setting**, which changes the *desktop's* mode and, as winit's own
//!   comment says, "does not provide a mechanism to … restore this to the desktop video mode as
//!   macOS and Windows do" — a crash leaves the player's desktop at our resolution.
//! - **On macOS** there is no exclusive mode to take.
//!
//! And the industry moved: SDL3 deleted `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP` and made borderless-desktop
//! what a fullscreen window *is* unless you opt into a mode with `SDL_SetWindowFullscreenMode`;
//! WoW itself removed exclusive fullscreen in **8.0.1**, leaving Windowed and Windowed
//! (Fullscreen) — VERIFIED at the source, not from the patch notes: Blizzard's own
//! `Blizzard_SettingsDefinitions_Shared/Graphics.lua` (live, `classic` and `classic_era`, all
//! identical) registers Display Mode as a **boolean** proxy and builds its dropdown from exactly
//! two entries, `VIDEO_OPTIONS_WINDOWED_FULLSCREEN` and `VIDEO_OPTIONS_WINDOWED`. **Our two states
//! are modern Classic's two states**, which is why 1650 wears them as that client's dropdown
//! rather than 1.12's checkbox. (Modern hangs the boolean on `gxMaximize`, having deleted
//! `gxWindow` outright; we keep `gxWindow`, which is the CVar our configs already persist.) Bevy's own `WindowMode::Fullscreen` arm is a liability besides — it `expect`s a
//! monitor at creation and `panic!`s on a live change that cannot resolve one
//! (`bevy_winit::winit_windows:91`, `system.rs:333`).
//!
//! **What this is worth, concretely.** Before 1627 the window was born `WindowMode::Windowed` at a
//! hard-coded 1600×900 with nothing able to change it — larger than a Steam Deck's 1280×800 panel,
//! and never flagged fullscreen. A window that does not fill gamescope's nested output is a
//! documented input break upstream (ValveSoftware/gamescope#1086 — pointer trapped in the nested
//! rect, clicks outside it dead; #1209 — tapping the letterbox warps the cursor to centre forever),
//! whose recorded workaround is "set the game to fullscreen".
//!
//! **No `gxRestart`.** 1.12 flags its whole video block restart-required; ours takes effect on the
//! click, the same stated departure [`apply_present_mode`] already makes for `gxVSync`.
//!
//! # VSync
//!
//! **Why it is a player setting and not a dev toggle.** It briefly lived as a checkbox on the perf
//! HUD, where it existed to answer one instrument question — "is the GPU keeping up?" — because a
//! synced frame reads as the display's grant whether it needed 3 ms or 16 (0717). That is the wrong
//! home twice over: the HUD is `#[cfg(feature = "dev")]`, so a player build could never reach it,
//! and vsync is not a diagnostic in the first place. It is the same option 1.12 shipped —
//! `OptionsFrameCheckButtons["VERTICAL_SYNC"] = { index = 5, cvar = "gxVSync", gxRestart = 1 }`,
//! Video Options, checkbox 5 — and the same one every engine since has kept. The instrument
//! question keeps `$WOW_NOVSYNC=1`, which is where a measurement knob belongs.
//!
//! **We do not require the restart 1.12 did.** The reference's row carries `gxRestart = 1` because
//! its device could not swap the presentation interval live; wgpu reconfigures the surface on the
//! next frame, so the checkbox takes effect as you click it. A deliberate, stated departure.
//!
//! **`AutoNoVsync`, never `Immediate`.** On macOS/Metal, explicit `Immediate` both rails *and*
//! takes ~1 s `nextDrawable` stalls — measured, and pinned at [`crate::capture::probe_uncap_mode`].
