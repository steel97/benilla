//! The hunter pet's **paper-doll stat block** — `GetPetHappiness`, `GetPetLoyalty`,
//! `GetPetTrainingPoints`, `GetPetExperience` and `HasPetUI` (decision 1005; wow-re
//! `ui/scratch/pet-action-bar-api.md` §11b + §6).
//!
//! Its own module rather than more of [`crate::ui_pet`] because it is a different concern on a
//! different clock: the action bar's contents arrive whole in `SMSG_PET_SPELLS` and change when
//! the server says so, while these five read plain descriptor fields plus two DBC tables and move
//! continuously — happiness drifts every few seconds while a pet is out. Tying them together would
//! make the bar's diff-and-fire churn on numbers no button draws.
//!
//! **One gate governs all four stat bindings**: `0x6116e0(pet)`, which resolves the pet, requires
//! its `UNIT_FIELD_PETNUMBER`, requires its owner to be us, and finishes
//! `cmp byte [player.fields + 0x79], 3; sete al` — `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0` byte 1, the class, against
//! **Hunter**. (The enum is pinned by the combo-point gate's own class test on the same byte:
//! `== 4 || == 0xB` is Rogue and Druid, wow-re `combo-point-gate.md`.) A warlock's imp therefore
//! resolves perfectly and still answers nothing — happiness, loyalty and training points are
//! hunter machinery — and each binding says "nothing" in its own way ([`benilla_ui::script::PetStats`]).
//!
//! **Two more bindings ride here off the pet's `CreatureFamily.dbc` row** (decision 1062), and they
//! sit on **opposite sides of that gate** — which is the whole reason they are worth naming
//! together. `UnitCreatureFamily("pet")` (`0x51a310`) has no class test whatsoever, so a warlock's
//! imp shows "Imp" on the page's level line; `GetPetFoodTypes()` (`0x4bea10`) shares the very same
//! `0x6116e0` gate as the four stats above, so a minion — or a charmed beast under a non-hunter —
//! answers an empty diet even when its family row has a food mask. Both are one lookup on the same
//! clock as the block above, pushed by the same setter, which is why they live here rather than in
//! [`crate::ui_pet`]'s token feed: splitting them would mean two systems racing the same
//! [`crate::names::NameCache`] entry for the same answer. See [`family_for`] for the one thing that
//! is not obvious: a pet's creature-template entry is its *descriptor's*, never its guid's.
