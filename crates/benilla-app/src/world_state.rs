//! The world-state table — the server's key/value scoreboard, fed by `SMSG_INIT_WORLD_STATES` and
//! `SMSG_UPDATE_WORLD_STATE` ([`benilla_protocol::messages::world_state`] for both wires).
//!
//! Two readers:
//!
//! - the NPC-text expander's `$<n>w` / `$<n>e` tokens ([`crate::npc_text`]) — the reference
//!   renders a hit as `%d` and a **miss as `"0"`**, so every such token printed `"0"` until this
//!   landed: faithful while the table was empty, wrong the moment a zone sent real states;
//! - the **world map's landmark pass** ([`crate::ui_world_map`], decision 1586) — an `AreaPOI.dbc`
//!   row carrying a `WorldStateID` shows only while that state reads non-zero, which is what makes
//!   the Eastern Plaguelands tower icons and the capitals' "Under Attack" markers appear and
//!   change side. [`WorldStates::generation`] is the edge it rebuilds on.
//!
//! Shape is the reference's, not a convenience: it keeps an open hash keyed by the **raw wire
//! dword** (`[0xb71ec8]`, bucket `mask & key`, value at node `+0x18`, miss → `0` at `0x4c5867`).
//! Raw matters because `$<n>e` reads the table at the *negated* key — `$2077e` looks up
//! `0xFFFFF7E3`, which only resolves if nothing re-interpreted the id on the way in.
//!
//! **An init CLEARS the table first** — carved 2026-08-25 (wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/worldstate-ui-law.md`), correcting the assumption this module shipped with.
//! `0x4c5650(ecx = map, edx = area)`, the function `SMSG_INIT_WORLD_STATES`' two leading dwords go
//! to before the pair loop runs, does four things in order: it drains every entry (the all-entries
//! list, then every bucket), stores the pair as the **display filter** `[0xb71e84]`/`[0xb71ea8]`,
//! rebuilds the world-state UI list against that filter, and only then does the handler apply the
//! packet's pairs. The bucket array itself survives; only entries are freed.
//!
//! That filter pair is [`WorldStates::scope`], and it is the reference's own notion of "where the
//! player is" for this UI — **the server's last init, never the avatar's position**. Its only two
//! writers image-wide are this clear and the logout reset.
