//! Instance/raid **lockout messages** — the six server packets that tell you about a saved
//! instance, the bookkeeping two of them feed, and the one thing you can do about it
//! (decision 1748).
//!
//! Four of the six become a `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` line, and **the client composes every one of them
//! itself**: no Lua handler in 1.12 touches this family (`RAID_INSTANCE_WELCOME`,
//! `INSTANCE_RESET_SUCCESS`, `INSTANCE_SAVED` and the rest appear in `GlobalStrings.lua` and
//! nowhere else in FrameXML). Each handler resolves the packet's `Map.dbc` id to a display name,
//! looks the template up through Lua `GetText`, fills it with `SStrPrintf`, and hands the result
//! to the chat chokepoint `0x49a870` with `edx = 0xa` = `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM`. That whole shape is
//! reproduced here; the only piece the app cannot do alone is the GlobalStrings read, which is why
//! the lines are QUEUED by the net drain and RESOLVED in [`feed_instance`] where the VM is — the
//! questgiver-refusal split of decision 0669.
//!
//! ## What each packet does (VERIFIED at the bytes, WoW.exe build 5875)
//!
//! | packet | handler | line |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `SMSG_RAID_INSTANCE_MESSAGE` | `0x49e1c0` | one of four `RAID_INSTANCE_*` templates |
//! | `SMSG_INSTANCE_RESET` | `0x49e470` | `INSTANCE_RESET_SUCCESS`, and clears the last-dungeon latch first |
//! | `SMSG_INSTANCE_RESET_FAILED` | `0x49e540` | one of three `INSTANCE_RESET_FAILED*` templates |
//! | `SMSG_INSTANCE_SAVE_CREATED` | `0x4e7e60` | `INSTANCE_SAVED` |
//! | `SMSG_UPDATE_LAST_INSTANCE` | `0x49e670` | none — records the dungeon we just left |
//! | `SMSG_UPDATE_INSTANCE_OWNERSHIP` | `0x49e6c0` | none — the "I hold a permanent bind" latch |
//!
//! ## The plural rule is the reference's, not ours
//!
//! Three of the four warning templates have a `_P1` twin ("…in %d hour." / "…in %d hours."), and
//! the client picks between them by calling **Lua `GetText(token, nil, ordinal)`** — the binding
//! `0x703bf0` is literally a Lua call into `LocaleProperties.lua`'s `GetText`, pushing the token,
//! then `nil` for gender, then the ordinal (or `nil` when the caller passed `-1`, which is what
//! the three fill-less templates do). `GetPluralIndex` is "1 or absent → the bare token, anything
//! else → `_P1`", and that includes **zero**: `…in 0 hours` is the reference's own output.
//! [`plural_token`] is that rule; the `_P1` probe falls back to the bare token exactly as
//! `GetText`'s own `if ( not string )` arm does.
//!
//! ## Two client bugs deliberately not reproduced
//!
//! `SMSG_INSTANCE_RESET_FAILED` with a reason ≥ 3 and `SMSG_INSTANCE_SAVE_CREATED` with a flag
//! ≥ 2 both fall past every arm of their handler's ladder and then call the chat chokepoint with
//! an **uninitialized 2 KB stack buffer**. vmangos's own enum names reason 3
//! `INSTANCERESET_FAIL_SILENTLY` "as well as any above this", so silence is the server's stated
//! intent; printing stack garbage is fidelity to an accident, not to a mechanism. Both print
//! nothing here.
//!
//! ## `CanShowResetInstances()` is a four-term predicate over `Map.dbc`
//!
//! The reference keeps four globals — `0xb4e370` (when we left), `0xb4e374` (what we left),
//! `0xb4e378` (where we are now) and `0xb4e37c` (do we hold a permanent bind) — and
//! `CanShowResetInstances 0x495c90` reads all four ([`InstanceState::can_reset`]). Three of them
//! live in [`InstanceState`]; the fourth is benilla's own [`benilla_world::world_map::CurrentMap`],
//! which is the same value by construction (the reference writes `0xb4e378` from
//! `[[0xb41414]+0xcc]`, the world's current map, at every world entry and at every
//! `SMSG_UPDATE_LAST_INSTANCE`).
//!
//! **The predicate is narrower than it looks**: `cmp [rec+8],1` means *party dungeon*, so the row
//! is offered only after a 5-man — never after a raid, and never while standing in a 5-man. The
//! 25-hour window (`0x15f90` seconds against `time(0)`, `0x495ce6`) is measured from when the
//! dungeon was left.
//!
//! ## Term 1 is the server's job, and vmangos gets it wrong (decision 1754)
//!
//! `0xb4e37c` is written by exactly one function (`0x495d50`) with exactly one caller
//! (`0x49e6d2`, the `SMSG_UPDATE_INSTANCE_OWNERSHIP` handler) — grepped over the whole `.text`,
//! so the client has no other source for it. Its real meaning is **"you hold at least one
//! instance bind"**, and the binary proves that by the company it keeps: the
//! `SMSG_UPDATE_LAST_INSTANCE` handler throws away every map that is not `InstanceType == 1`
//! (`0x495d33`), so a server that only ever named RAID binds in that packet would leave a
//! handler whose only possible effect is nothing. The packet exists to name **5-man** binds.
//!
//! vmangos names none. All three of its senders — `Player::SendRaidInfo`,
//! `Player::SendSavedInstances`, and the `UpdateLastInstance` loop inside it — filter
//! `m_boundInstances` to `itr.second.perm`, and entering a 5-man takes
//! `DungeonMap::Add`'s `player->BindToInstance(state, false)` — a **non-permanent** bind. So a
//! character without a raid save is told `owns_saved = false` forever, and a client that believes
//! it shows the reset row to nobody it was built for. That is a server defect (inherited from
//! MaNGOS, identical in cmangos), not the reference's behaviour.
//!
//! benilla therefore satisfies term 1 from **either** source: the packet, or
//! [`InstanceState::saw_own_dungeon`] — our own eyes. When the world-entry writer below records a
//! party dungeon, it is recording that *we personally just walked out of one*, and the server
//! binds you on entry, so the bind is a fact whether or not vmangos will admit it. This is the
//! one deliberate deviation in this module; everything else is the reference's.
//!
//! ## The last-dungeon latch has TWO writers, and the packet is the lesser one
//!
//! `0x495d10` — "we just moved from map A to map B; if A was a party dungeon, remember it" — is
//! called from two places, and reading only the packet handler gets the feature backwards:
//!
//! 1. **the client's own world entry** (`0x464ff0`, called from the map-load path at `0x4015f3`
//!    and `0x401c22`) with `A` = the map we were on and `B` = the map we are entering. This is
//!    the writer that actually fires when you walk out of the Deadmines;
//! 2. **`SMSG_UPDATE_LAST_INSTANCE`** (`0x49e6ac`) with `A` = the packet's map and `B` = the
//!    world's current map.
//!
//! Against vmangos, **(2) can never record anything** — its `perm` filter (above) means the only
//! maps it ever names are raids, and a raid is `InstanceType == 2`, which `0x495d33`'s
//! `cmp [rec+8],1` rejects. (1) is the only live writer here, which is why it is also the one
//! that answers term 1. (1) is [`track_instance_state`]'s `CurrentMap` flip; (2) is
//! [`apply::update_last_instance`]'s queue, drained through the same helper so the two cannot
//! drift — [`LatchWriter`] is which of them is speaking.
//!
//! **(2) is therefore unreachable on our server by construction, and no live probe can cover it**
//! — not with any rigging, because `PermBindAllPlayers` (vmangos's only path to a permanent bind)
//! runs under `if (IsRaid())` and no GM command creates a bind. Its cover is
//! `both_latch_writers_through_the_real_system`, which drives both legs through the real system
//! against the real `Map.dbc`. That is the whole of the evidence behind (2): treat it as tested,
//! never as *observed*.
