//! **display-facing smoother** ([`drive_display_facing`]) — the client's `0x600cd0` goal chain and
//! its `+0xc98` box filter — with the [`FacingStep`] latch the anim layer's turn-shuffle reads
//! (decision 0123).
//!
//! **A unit has two facings and only one of them is the wire's** (wow-re
//! `object-layer/scratch/interaction-facing.md`, `body-facing-pipeline.md`'s 2026-07-04 CORRECTION).
//! The raw movement facing `CMovement+0x1c` is what the server put there; the *rendered character
//! body root* is the smoothed display facing `CGUnit+0xc94`, and the client turns that one
//! client-side, every frame, toward a goal it picks from an ordered chain. Two of that chain's goals
//! are local decisions the server never sends: a stationary unit squares up on its
//! `UNIT_FIELD_TARGET`, and **an NPC turns to face you for as long as its interaction window is
//! open** (bug B110, decision 1467).
//!
//! benilla collapses the two facings into the unit's `Transform.rotation`, which is therefore the
//! *display* facing; [`DisplayFacing::wire`] keeps the raw one alongside it, because the goal chain
//! falls back to the raw facing — and that fallback is what swings an NPC **back** to its authored
//! heading when you close its window. In the client the raw facing separately places the
//! collision/cull node, so a turning NPC's collision does not move; ours does. That asymmetry is a
//! named approximation, not fidelity: a unit's collision footprint is a capsule and its cull volume
//! a sphere, so rotating them is very nearly a no-op.
