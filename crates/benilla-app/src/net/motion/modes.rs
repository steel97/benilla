/// This is [`crate::player::state::MoveModes`]' observer twin: the same bits, in the same word, for
/// a body somebody else is driving. It exists because those bits had **nowhere to live** for a unit
/// that is not our mover — a remote player's arrive inside [`super::RemoteMotion::flags`] with each
/// relayed pose, and a creature, which never sends a pose at all, had no flags word whatsoever. So
/// every mode a creature was granted was simply dropped: `crates/benilla-app/src/net/motion/
/// remote.rs` said as much in as many words ("a remote's own granted modes are not modelled yet").
///
/// **One word per unit is the reference's own shape**, not a convenience: `CMovement` is embedded at
/// `CGUnit+0x9a8` and its `+0x40` MOVEMENTFLAGS dword is *the* per-unit movement state, written by
/// the relay merge, the create block, the spline installer and this opcode family alike (wow-re
/// `collision/scratch/moveflag-family.md` §5.2). We keep the granted-mode half separate from
/// [`super::RemoteMotion::flags`] for one reason: the relay merge re-authors that word wholesale
/// from every pose, and a creature has no poses to be re-authored from.
///
/// Absent component ⇒ no modes granted, which is the overwhelming majority of units; it is inserted
/// on the first `SMSG_SPLINE_MOVE_*` that names the unit and lives as long as the entity, exactly as
/// the reference's word lives as long as the `CGUnit` (`walk-mode-law.md` §1: `CMovement` is
/// constructed once per unit and nothing else clears it).

// mover, whose feather fall is [`crate::player::state::MoveModes::feather_fall`], and a relayed
// player, whose `MOVEFLAG_SAFE_FALL` rides its own poses inside the server-authored merge mask and
// is read straight off [`super::RemoteMotion::flags`] there. A creature, the one body this
// component is really for, never falls: it rides its [`super::Spline`] and its Z is the ground
// clamp's. An accessor with no caller would be a claim that the mode is wired when it is not.
