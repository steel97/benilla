//! **When** a remote unit's relayed move replays — the reference's per-unit replay chain, byte-traced
//! (decision 0615; supersedes the invented estimator of 0601).
//!
//! A remote's inbound `MSG_MOVE_*` is not applied at arrival: it is given a client **fire-time** and
//! waits in the unit's queue until the clock reaches it, the dead-reckon covering the mover's own
//! timeline in between (decision 0601, wow-re `remote-apply-timing.md`). The law that picks that
//! fire-time lives in `0x618c30` + its window helper `0x618b50`, and it is **per unit** — five cells
//! on the unit's own CMovement, no manager cursor:
//!
//! | cell | here | meaning |
//! |------|------|---------|
//! | `+0xa8` | [`RelayChain::last_fire_ms`] | the fire-time the previous packet was given |
//! | `+0xac` | [`RelayChain::last_wire_ms`] | the previous packet's wire stamp |
//! | `+0xbc[32]`/`+0x13c` | [`RelayChain::ring`]/`ring_idx` | the lateness ring + its cursor |
//! | `+0x140` | [`RelayChain::base_ms`] | the lateness base the ring is stored against |
//!
//! The law, in one line: **a moving unit replays on the sender's own cadence** — `fire = prev fire +
//! (this wire stamp − prev wire stamp)`, so the spacing our client plays back is exactly the spacing
//! the stamps carry, no matter how the packets clumped in flight. The buffer that absorbs the clumping
//! is only ever re-sized while the mover is **idle with nothing queued**: there the chain re-bases by
//! the worst lateness seen over the last 32 packets, which is a de-jitter buffer sized by measured
//! jitter rather than by an estimate re-derived per packet. Either way the offset from arrival is held
//! in `[−500, +1000] ms`.
//!
//! Byte index: `0x618c30` (chain: seed `@0x618c54`, wire delta `@0x618ca0-cc2`, skew out `@0x618ccf`,
//! idle+empty gate `@0x618ce4`/`@0x618cf3`, re-base `@0x618cfc-d41`, clamps `@0x618d0d`/`@0x618d49`,
//! fire store `@0x618dcc`, due test `@0x618dd2`) · `0x618b50` (the ring) · `0x615c30` (the drain).
