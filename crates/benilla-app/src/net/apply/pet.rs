//! The pet bar's wire arms (decisions 0982, 0988) — `SMSG_PET_SPELLS`, `SMSG_PET_MODE`,
//! `SMSG_PET_ACTION_FEEDBACK`, `SMSG_PET_CAST_FAILED` folded into [`crate::ui_pet::PetBar`].
//!
//! The whole file is short because `SMSG_PET_SPELLS` is not a delta — it **is** the bar, so
//! applying it is a replace. These four arms own the bar's CONTENTS; its lit state is
//! [`crate::ui_pet`]'s, latched on the press because the server never answers one (that file's
//! module doc has the why). The only state this file writes is what actually arrives on the wire.
//!
//! The two refusal arms deliberately reuse the *player's* red-line queues rather than growing pet
//! copies: both resolve their text through the VM's own `GlobalStrings.lua` the same way, and the
//! cast-fail resolver keys its power family on the failing **spell's** record ([`cast_fail`]'s
//! `power_keys(spell.power_type)`), so a pet's focus ability already reads "Not enough focus"
//! with no pet-awareness anywhere in the display layer.
