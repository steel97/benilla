//! The pet bar's wire arms (decisions 0982, 0988) — `SMSG_PET_SPELLS`, `SMSG_PET_MODE`,
//! `SMSG_PET_ACTION_FEEDBACK`, `SMSG_PET_CAST_FAILED` folded into [`crate::ui_pet::PetBar`].
//!
//! The whole file is short because `SMSG_PET_SPELLS` is not a delta — it **is** the bar, so
//! applying it is a replace. These four arms own the bar's CONTENTS; its lit state is
//! [`crate::ui_pet`]'s, latched on the press because the server never answers one (that file's
//! module doc has the why). The only state this file writes is what actually arrives on the wire.
//!
//! The two refusal arms share the player's red-line **queues** — one drain, one sink, one
//! GlobalStrings lookup — but they do **not** share his message table, and believing they did is
//! what decision 2033 corrects. The reference gives each of these packets its own handler with its
//! own reason -> errorId map (`0x4bdb70` for the feedback byte, `0x6e8eb0` for the cast refusal),
//! and both maps exist precisely to say "your **pet** is dead / rooted / out of range" where the
//! player's says "you are". So the caster rides the queue as far as [`cast_fail`], which picks the
//! table; everything downstream of that stays pet-unaware, as it should be.
