    // 1.12.1 has no addon opcode and no addon `ChatMsg` type. The real client never renders it; it
    // fires `CHAT_MSG_ADDON` instead. Rendering it printed a partied real-client player's
    // `[Party] [Soreen]: Quiver VERSION:3.1.4` version ping as ordinary party chat, and a
    // mixed-client party makes that constant background noise.
    //
    // VERIFIED in `WoW.exe` (5875) — wow-re `system/ui/scratch/addon-chat-law.md`: the test is
    // `0x49a89b`/`0x49a89e cmp edi,-0x1`, in the DISPLAY function `0x49a870`, and every branch of
    // the addon arm `[0x49a8a7, 0x49a96d)` jumps below the normal render path at `0x49a970` — the
    // chat frame is unreachable for such a line by construction. The **language field is the whole
    // discriminator**: the type byte takes no part in the comparison, and the wire parser
    // `0x49d560` never inspects language at all.
    //
    // **Ignore beats addon**, so that check comes first even though it costs a duplicated call:
    // the reference drops an ignored sender's line at `0x49d72d`, *upstream* of the language test,
    // so an ignored player's addon traffic fires nothing at all. Unobservable while both paths
    // merely drop, but it is the precedence that has to already be right the day there is
    // something to fire. (`CMSG_CHAT_IGNORED` is not owed here — the server refuses `LANG_ADDON`
    // on WHISPER, the only type that answers on the wire.)
    //
    // **One divergence, named:** the reference suppresses *after* name resolution — an uncached
    // sender parks the line in `__AUPENDINGCHAT__` (`0x49d7ba`) behind `CMSG_NAME_QUERY`, and
    // `CHAT_MSG_ADDON` fires late from the callback `0x49ccc0`. We drop here instead, ahead of the
    // name query [`ChatLog::push_wire`] would queue, which saves a name query per addon sender.
    //
    // **THE CHANNEL IS NOW HALF-OPEN, and that is the state of it — not a claim that it works.**
    // Decision 1235 landed the SEND half: `SendAddonMessage` composes, validates against the
    // client's four-lane whitelist and puts a real `CMSG_MESSAGECHAT`/`LANG_ADDON` on the wire.
    // Nothing on THIS side changed, so an addon can broadcast and **cannot hear** — including its
    // own echo (vmangos's `Group::BroadcastPacket` takes no ignore-guid, so the party lane returns
    // a sender's own line, and an addon that sequences on that echo sees nothing).
    //
    // Opening the receive half is NOT deleting this `return`, which is why it is separate work:
    //
    //   - `CHAT_MSG_ADDON` (event 227, `0x49a95f push 0xe3`) is **not a `ChatTypeInfo` key** and
    //     cannot ride [`crate::ui_chat::event`]'s pipeline — it has its own format string and its
    //     own 4-argument shape `(prefix, message, distribution, sender)`, against the chat
    //     family's ten. `every_fired_event_name_is_a_chat_type_info_key` would rightly fail it.
    //   - `prefix`/`message` come from splitting the text on its **FIRST** tab (`0x49a8d0`); with
    //     no tab the whole text is the *prefix* and the message is `""`, not the other way round.
    //   - `distribution` is the remap table `0x49aff4` → jump table `0x49afe0`: only
    //     PARTY/RAID/GUILD/BATTLEGROUND get names, every other type byte reports `"UNKNOWN"`.
    //   - the *fire* must move downstream of the name resolve so `sender` is a name, not a guid.
    //     The drop can stay here; the fire cannot.
    //
    // All four are recorded byte-exact in wow-re `system/ui/scratch/addon-chat-law.md` §3/§4/§6.
