//! Per-frame motion model for streamed units: server splines + remote-player dead-reckoning.
//!
//! Two motion sources drive an entity's [`Transform`] between the sparse server packets (decisions 0052
//! + 0053):
//! - **[`Spline`]** — a server-authored path, sampled at constant speed by
//!   [`spline::sample_splines`]. Creatures ride these. Two sources, one component: a fresh
//!   `SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE` ([`spline::monster_move_spline`]), and the walk a unit was **already** on when
//!   it streamed into view, joined mid-path from its create block ([`spline::create_spline`], 0708).
//! - **[`RemoteMotion`]** — another player's flag-driven locomotion, integrated by
//!   [`remote::extrapolate_remote_units`]: the client's own dead-reckoning in miniature (extrapolate
//!   from the last reported state, snap to the truth on the next packet). A jump is a **ballistic
//!   event** — the launch played out locally under gravity — not flag-driven walking (decision 0053).
//!
//! The parent [`super`] module owns the wire→ECS bridge that seeds + corrects these from the packet
//! stream; this module owns the integration, split by concern: [`spline`] (the path walk + its
//! terrain re-ground), [`remote`] (dead-reckoning + jump ballistics), [`relay`] (***when*** a relayed
//! move replays — the per-unit fire-time chain), [`facing`] (wire facing
//! resolution + the client-local idle re-face and its [`FacingStep`] shuffle latch). This face keeps
//! the shared pose glue. Poses live canonically in raw WoW space on the components; the `Transform`
//! is derived (translation + facing only — scale, baked by the renderer, is preserved).
