//! Per-frame motion model for streamed units: server splines + remote-player dead-reckoning.
//!
//! Two motion sources drive an entity's [`Transform`] between the sparse server packets (decisions 0052
//! + 0053):
//! - **[`Spline`]** — a server-authored path, sampled at constant speed by
//!   [`spline::sample_splines`]. Creatures ride these. Two sources, one component: a fresh
//!   `SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE` ([`spline::monster_move_spline`]), and the walk a unit was **already** on when
//!   it streamed into view, joined mid-path from its create block ([`spline::create_spline`], 0708).
//! - **[`RemoteMotion`]** — another player's flag-driven locomotion, integrated by
//!   [`remote::extrapolate_remote_units`]: the client's own dead-reckoning in miniature (extrapolate
//!   from the last reported state, snap to the truth on the next packet). A jump is a **ballistic
//!   event** — the launch played out locally under gravity — not flag-driven walking (decision 0053).
//!
//! The parent [`super`] module owns the wire→ECS bridge that seeds + corrects these from the packet
//! stream; this module owns the integration, split by concern: [`spline`] (the path walk + its
//! terrain re-ground), [`remote`] (dead-reckoning + jump ballistics), [`relay`] (***when*** a relayed
//! move replays — the per-unit fire-time chain), [`facing`] (wire facing
//! resolution + the client-local idle re-face and its [`FacingStep`] shuffle latch). This face keeps
//! the shared pose glue. Poses live canonically in raw WoW space on the components; the `Transform`
//! is derived (translation + placement rotation only — scale, baked by the renderer, is preserved).

/// `GAMEOBJECT_FACING` yaw.
///
/// The reference builds a GO's render matrix from that quaternion — `0x5f7910` (the every-frame
/// slot-13 Animate) composes `GetPosition` → gx-rotate by the 4 floats at GO-fields `+0x10` →
/// gx-scale, and the same 4×4 (`obj+0x218`) is what its collision reads (wow-re
/// `object-layer/scratch/w2c1.md` §Q2/§Q3). `GAMEOBJECT_FACING` is a *separate* accessor
/// (`0x5f9fb0`) that the placement never consults.
///
/// A yaw is the special case here, not a simplification of it: vmangos copies `rotation0/1` from the
/// spawn row verbatim and fills `rotation2/3` from the facing when the row leaves them zero
/// (`GameObject::UpdateRotationFields`), so a row that authors no `rotation0/1` sends
/// `(0, 0, sin(o/2), cos(o/2))` — and that quaternion **is** `rot_z(o)` exactly. 54 747 of its
/// 56 632 live spawn rows are that case and place bit-identically either way. The 1 885 that do not (1 410
/// authoring a real tilt in `rotation0/1`, 475 a yaw that disagrees with their own `orientation`
/// column; 1 411 of them on a visible display) are exactly what a yaw-only placement gets wrong —
/// and it misreads as a *position* bug, because an M2's geometry sits off its own origin: a signpost
/// pointer's plank is 3.3 yd above the origin and 0.3–2.1 yd out, so dropping a 70° tilt swings that
/// plank 4.3 yd from a spawn point that never moved (decision 1459, bug B89).
///
/// Falls back to the facing when the wire carried no quaternion at all, and when what it carried has
/// no length to normalize — a create block folds absent fields to zero, and an all-zero quat would
/// normalize to `NaN` and blank the object. Length is otherwise *not* assumed: one shipped row
