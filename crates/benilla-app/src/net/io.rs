//! The background networking threads — the socket half of the net bridge.
//!
//! [`spawn_net`] starts a read thread with **two park points** (decisions 0193 + 0539): it first
//! parks **pre-logon** on the credentials channel — the login screen's pause — then, once a
//! [`LoginRequest`] (credentials *and* the realmlist to dial) walks logon → realm → world
//! handshake (emitting [`SessionEvent::LoginStage`]s,
//! and [`SessionEvent::LoginFailed`] + re-park on any pre-roster failure), it **parks at character
//! select**: it emits the roster as a [`SessionEvent::CharacterList`] and blocks until the app
//! answers with a guid over the pick channel. The pick sends `CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN`, and the thread
//! streams decoded [`SessionEvent`]s from there. All *policy* (credential auto-resubmit and its
//! pacing, the env fast path, auto-relogin on reconnect, the director's click) is app-side
//! ([`crate::login`], [`crate::char_select`]); this thread is a pure sequencer — it never sleeps.
//!
//! On a stream failure it emits a [`SessionEvent::Disconnected`] carrying
//! [`SessionEnd::Lost`] and returns to the login park; a clean in-game logout
//! ([`SessionEvent::LoggedOut`]) does the same with [`SessionEnd::LoggedOut`]. What happens next is
//! the app's, and the two answers differ (decision 1262): the logout relists, while a loss ends the
//! session at the account screen unless nobody is there to type. A single long-lived sibling write thread drains
//! [`ClientCommand`](super::ClientCommand)s down to the server; each successful connection hands it
//! the fresh [`WorldWriter`] over a swap channel, so "exactly one writer" is structural, not
//! signalled. The ECS half (draining the events into components each frame, and tearing the
//! streamed world down on disconnect) lives in the parent module; the halves communicate only
//! through the channels, so they split cleanly.
