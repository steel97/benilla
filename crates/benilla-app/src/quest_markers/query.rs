//! The **query** half of the overhead markers: when to ask the server what an NPC's `!`/`?` should
//! be — and, for a GameObject, when to ask a question whose answer is thrown away. The rendering
//! half is [`super`].
//!
//! **Both markers, not just the questgiver one** (decision 1918). The gold `!` and the flight
//! master's green `!` are the same `unit+0xb2c`: `0x607480` installs whichever arrives into that
//! one slot, `0x6073f0` zeroes it (along with `+0xcb8`), and `0x607380` — the per-unit path — tears
//! it down once and then re-issues *both* queries, `0x182` on `UNIT_NPC_FLAGS` bit 1 and `0x1aa` on
//! bit 3. One slot cannot have two lifetimes, so one system owns both asks; `ui_taxi` keeps the
//! resulting fact ([`crate::ui_taxi::FlightMasterStatus`]) and nothing else.
//!
//! **A GameObject is queried and never rendered** (decision 1872, wow-re `questgiver-marker.md`
//! §W14). The reference sends `CMSG_QUESTGIVER_STATUS_QUERY` for a quest-flagged GameObject from
//! both object sweeps, but its answer handler `0x5dc9f0` resolves the GUID with typemask **8**
//! (`0x468460` is a bitmask AND against `OBJECT_FIELD_TYPE`), so a GameObject's `0x21` returns NULL
//! and the packet dies at `0x5dca2f` — and even if it did not, a GameObject has no `+0xcb8` status
//! slot, no `+0xb2c` marker slot, and (11 models out of ~1600, none of them a poster) no
//! attachment 18 to hang a marker from. So: **send the query, drop the answer, render nothing.**
//!
//! The server only ever *answers* `CMSG_QUESTGIVER_STATUS_QUERY` (vmangos `QuestHandler.cpp`) — it
//! never pushes — so every refresh point is the client's own to trigger, and a status that is never
//! re-asked for is a marker frozen at whatever it was when we first saw the NPC. That made this a
//! surprisingly deep fidelity question; the answer is decisions 0650 (the reference's trigger set,
//! byte-enumerated) and 0654 (what benilla implements of it), and it lives on [`query_statuses`].

/// The reference's refresh law is a **descriptor field watch**, not a hand-picked event list: it

/// still-open gaps, are decision 0650 (the byte-level trigger set, superseding 0647's wrong
/// "level is a deviation") and decision 0654 (what benilla implements of it).
///
/// **The sweep** — every visible questgiver is re-asked when any *self* input to the server's
/// answer moves. The reference gets this from six descriptor watches plus four packet handlers;
/// ours is [`self_generation`] (the descriptor half, recomputed only when our store actually
/// changes) XOR [`QuestGiver::reask_epoch`] (the packet half, bumped from `net/apply`). A changed
/// generation clears the whole asked set, which is the sweep.
///
/// **Per unit** — the reference queries one unit from its create/init path (`0x607380`) and when
/// its own fields move: the questgiver bit (`0x60b490`), the flightmaster bit (`0x60b4c5`), and
/// anything that could change its *reaction* to us (`0x606f0a`). Ours keys the asked set on
/// [`unit_ask_key`], so any of those re-asks that one NPC; and the entry is dropped when the guid
/// leaves [`GuidIndex`], which is the create-path query (the reference caches the answer *on* the
/// unit at `unit+0xcb8`, so its cache dies with the object — ours is a map and needs the prune).
///
/// **Per GameObject — on a sweep, and ONLY on a sweep.** A quest-giving GameObject (a wanted
/// poster, a suspicious barrel) is a questgiver on the wire exactly as a creature is: the same
/// sweep callback tests typemask bit 5 and sends the same opcode for it (`0x5eb0a0` @ `0x5eb159`,
/// and its sibling `0x5eb3f0` @ `0x5eb456`), gated on [`GO_FLAG_INTERACT_COND`] and on the
/// GameObject's own reaction toward us being **> 1** ([`go_reaction`], the reference's `0x5f7fd0`).
/// The wire corpus shows it happening in 20 of 62 real sessions.
///
/// But there is **no bring-up query for a GameObject** — the contrast with units is exact and it
/// is the point (wow-re §W14.8, a closed caller census: a GameObject GUID can reach this opcode
/// through exactly two instructions in the whole image and both are inside a sweep callback; the
/// `CGGameObject_C` ctor and its vtable slot 3 call no sender, where `CGUnit_C`'s slot 3 does). So
/// a GameObject is asked about only when a sweep happens to run while it is in view, and a player
/// who completes a quest elsewhere and then walks up to the turn-in object never asks about it at
/// all. That is a real, slightly surprising reference behaviour, and **a per-guid asked-set that
/// queries on first sight is a deviation, not a fix** — hence the `swept` gate below rather than
/// an [`unit_ask_key`] analogue. Nothing visible turns on any of this: the answer is dropped
/// ([`crate::net::apply`]'s own typemask gate), which is decision 1872's whole point.
///
/// **The teardown legs — and there are two of them, neither the one this file used to claim**
/// (decision 1906, wow-re §W15). `0x5eb0a0` is a **2×2 on (questgiver bit × reaction)**, and its
/// `0x5eb134` is a *convergent* block — reached both when the bit is clear (`0x5eb125 je`) and when
/// the bit is set but the reaction failed (`0x5eb132 jg` not taken). That convergence is why three
/// incompatible readings of this callback were live at once. The table:
///
/// | `UNIT_NPC_FLAGS & 0x2` | reaction **> 1** | reaction **≤ 1** |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | **set** | sends `0x182` (`0x5eb159`) | **tears down** (`0x5eb143`) |
/// | **clear** | **nothing** (`0x5eb15e`) | **tears down** (`0x5eb143`) |
///
/// So the sweep tears down **iff the reaction is Hated/Hostile**, whether or not the unit is a
/// questgiver — and it *never* tears down on the flag alone, which is what decision 0647 recorded
/// and what this file did until now. A flag that goes off is torn down by the **`UNIT_NPC_FLAGS`
/// field watch** instead (`0x6043c5` registers `0x604a20` → `0x60b420`, which XORs old against new
/// and calls `0x607380` on *any* change to bit `0x2`) — and `0x607380`'s **first instruction after
/// its prologue** is `0x607384 call 0x6073f0`, an unconditional teardown no branch can skip, with
/// the reaction gate (`0x6073b2`) sitting *after* it and guarding only the re-issued queries. Ours
/// is [`unit_ask_key`] moving, which is the same event observed from outside.
///
/// **The two sweeps therefore disagree, deliberately.** The light sweep (`0x5eb070`, 11 callers)
/// runs the table above. The full re-query sweep (`0x5eb3c0`, 2 callers — **your revive**, and a
/// change to your own record's reaction inputs) runs `0x5eb3f0`, whose creature arm is an
/// unconditional `0x607380`: every creature's marker is torn down and then re-asked for. `full`
/// below is that distinction.
///
/// There is no GameObject counterpart to any of it: a GameObject has no status to invalidate
/// (`+0xcb8` is `0x9a8` bytes past the end of a `0x310`-byte `CGGameObject_C`), and all 8 of
/// `0x6073f0`'s call sites are unit-side.
///
/// **Still not covered**, and why: the reference also sweeps when an *item* moves between
/// containers (an `ITEM` typeid watch, `0x5d9375` — quest availability can depend on carried
/// items). benilla does not stream item objects (`EntityKind` has no `Item`), so there is nothing
/// to watch; the equipment and equipped-bag guids in our own descriptor *are* folded, which covers
/// equipping, unequipping and swapping a bag but not moving a stack inside one. Per unit, the
/// reference's reaction refresh also keys on charm/persuade/duel-team/`PLAYER_BYTES_3`; we key on
/// the faction template, and catch a standing change through the reputation sweep instead.
