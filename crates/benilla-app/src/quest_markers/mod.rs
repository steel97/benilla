//! Overhead questgiver markers — the client's own `Interface\Buttons\TalkToMe*` M2s floating
//! above NPC heads: gold `!` (quest available), gold `?` (turn-in ready), grey `!`/`?` and the
//! light-blue `?` per the status map.
//!
//! The data plane is the era wire: every visible creature flagged `UNIT_NPC_FLAG_QUESTGIVER`
//! gets one `CMSG_QUESTGIVER_STATUS_QUERY` — the server only ever *answers* queries (vmangos
//! `QuestHandler.cpp:36-77`), never pushes, so every refresh point is the client's own to trigger,
//! and a status that is never re-asked for is a marker frozen at first sight. The re-ask law —
//! the reference's self-player descriptor **field watch**, and which of it we implement — is its
//! own concern and lives in [`query`] (decisions 0650/0654). Answers land in [`QuestGiver`]'s
//! per-guid status map (`net/apply`); THIS module is the render half: attach, scale, animate.
//!
//! The render law is byte-verified (wow-re object-layer `questgiver-marker.md`):
//! - **Attach** (`0x6074c0`): the marker is a CHILD of the unit's own body M2 at attachment slot
//!   **18** (0x12) — slot 29 is preferred only when a mount model exists (benilla has no mounts
//!   yet; add that branch with the mount arc). No slot ⇒ the marker is created but never parented
//!   — invisible; we render nothing.
//! - **Scale** (`0x607570`): `1 / |attach-bone basis|`, computed once at attach and baked into the
//!   marker's base matrix — the marker renders at a constant world size regardless of the NPC's
//!   model scale (a gnome and an ogre get the same-sized `!`). Not distance-based, not unit scale.
//! - **Animation** (`0x6076c0`): the marker's own M2 animation is armed looping — anim **0**
//!   normally, anim **190** while the unit has a live overhead-name object (`unit+0xc7c` via
//!   `0x6c7950`). The two bands hold the same 3-key bob SHAPE at different heights: anim 0 at the
//!   attach point (WoW z 0 → −0.089), anim 190 raised (+0.517 → +0.427) — the authored push-up
//!   that lifts the marker clear of the name text (m2bones key-value probe, all five models; an
//!   earlier count-only probe recorded them as "the same bob" — falsified by the director's
//!   reference eye, decision record with this change).
//!
//! benilla's translation (m2bones-probed: every marker M2 is ONE bone with a 3-key translation
//! bob): a **seat** entity parented under the unit's slot-18 joint (the held-items rail) carries
//! the one-time `1/L` counter-scale; the `!` models (plain bone) animate through the doodad rail
//! ([`crate::doodad_anim::spawn_anim_host`] — skinned twin + the one-time sequence-0 arm); the `?`
//! models (cylindrical-billboard bone) render as [`BillboardCard`]s under the identity root —
//! cards write ABSOLUTE world transforms, so they can't sit under the moving seat; instead
//! [`re_seat_cards`] re-seats them from the seat's world placement each frame (PostUpdate, the
//! same-frame propagated pose), and the card's own
//! armed [`seq_translation`](BillboardCard::with_seq_translation) loop plays the bob. Markers are
//! few and player-adjacent, so the anim host runs ungated (no draw-gate `DoodadAnimHost`).
//! [`pose_markers`] swaps every marker between the low and raised bob as the unit's overhead
//! elements toggle (the floating name [`Nameplates::shows`] OR a live V-plate — our `unit+0xc7c`;
//! the plate leg is a director-pinned deviation, rationale on [`pose_markers`], 0408/0409):
//! cards re-arm the matching loop, hosts switch the playing clip.
