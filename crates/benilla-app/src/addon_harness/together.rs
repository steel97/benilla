//! **The control for the one-VM-per-addon bound** — the whole folder in ONE VM, the way a real
//! client runs it.
//!
//! The survey next door loads each addon into a VM of its own, with only its declared dependencies
//! underneath, and says so in its own header: *the headline is a floor, not an estimate*. That
//! bound is real and it is the largest single category left in the corpus's failures — a package
//! that does not ship `Tablet-2.0` and simply expects the library to be there, because in a folder
//! of 219 addons seventy of its neighbours ship a copy and Ace2's registry is one global table.
//!
//! **A bound that is stated and never measured is an excuse.** This is the measurement: one Lua
//! state, every addon in the folder walked in load order, dependencies first, each addon's
//! `ADDON_LOADED` at its own position — then the session start, once, for everybody. What comes
//! back is *which addons raise inside their own files when their neighbours are present*, and the
//! difference between that list and the survey's is exactly the size of the bound.
//!
//! ## What this is NOT
//!
//! Not a replacement for the survey and not a headline. It cannot attribute a *render* or a *use*
//! result (every addon's frames are in one world), it cannot tell "clean" from "never reached",
//! and one addon's runaway is everybody's. Attribution here is by the RAISING CHUNK and nothing
//! else — the same rule the survey applies to session errors, and the only one available when 219
//! addons share a state.
//!
//! ## It is run N times, and the reason is the whole finding
//!
//! **A big shared VM is not reproducible, and that is a property of Lua rather than a defect of
//! ours.** Lua 5.1 hashes a **table key by its POINTER** (`hashpointer`), so `pairs()` over a
//! registry keyed by objects — which is what every Ace2 library's registry is — walks in a
//! different order on every process, because ASLR moves the addresses. Measured directly rather
//! than deduced: twelve fresh tables as keys in one table, iterated, gave `3,7,11,1,…` then
//! `12,5,9,2,…` then `11,1,4,8,…` on three consecutive runs of the same binary.
//!
//! The reference's Lua does exactly the same thing, so this is a fact about the sessions we are
//! modelling and not something to fix. What it means for an INSTRUMENT is that a single run's
//! number cannot be quoted: three consecutive runs here disagreed by one addon and swapped three
//! rows. So the walk runs [`DEFAULT_RUNS`] times in fresh VMs and the verdict is per row:
//!
//!   - **raised in EVERY run** — a real failure with the neighbours present;
//!   - **raised in SOME** — order-sensitive, named as such and never folded into either count;
//!   - **clean in every run** — clean.
//!
//! The per-addon survey next door has been stable run to run (three rosters, byte-identical), and
//! the reason is scale rather than luck: one addon and its declared dependencies rarely build a
//! pointer-keyed registry big enough for the order to change an outcome. "Rarely" is not "never",
//! which is worth knowing about every `--diff` this arc has read as exact.
//!
//! **LoadOnDemand is ignored on purpose.** 62 of the corpus's manifests carry `## LoadOnDemand: 1`
//! and the boot walk skips every one (`0x51f600` loads only records whose LoadOnDemand byte is 0),
//! but the corpus's own addons then demand-load them: `FuBar.lua:1034`'s `LoadLoadOnDemandPlugins`
//! pulls in every installed `FuBar_*` the moment any one of them seats, and Auctioneer's stub does
//! the same for its family. A run that honoured the flag would answer for a session five minutes
//! shorter than the one anybody plays.
