//! **The render column — "did this addon put anything on screen?"**
//!
//! Every other column in [`super`] is load- or event-based: they ask whether something *raised*.
//! None of them could ask whether anything was **drawn**, and that gap is not theoretical — the
//! director installed Bagnon, opened their bags, and saw a title and a gold line with **no bag
//! slots at all**, while the survey scored it `loaded, missing=0, session=ok, probe=ok`. The cause
//! raised nothing anywhere (`crate::ui_script::bagnon_render_tests` is the reproduction), so no
//! error-shaped instrument could ever have found it.
//!
//! ## The oracle: a handle diff, not a name and not a total
//!
//! [`RenderBaseline::of`] snapshots every live draw target *before* the addon runs a line; anything
//! new afterwards was created by the addon. Both obvious alternatives are wrong, and wrong in ways
//! this arc has already been bitten by:
//!
//! - **A with/without quad-count diff** reads zero for an addon that *replaces* rather than adds.
//!   Bagnon takes the bags over: our own `BenillaBagFrame` stops drawing as Bagnon starts, and the
//!   total barely moves whether Bagnon painted sixteen slots or none. (Measured: 16 either way, in
//!   the first draft of the reproduction test.)
//! - **A name-prefix match** cannot see an anonymous frame, and `!OmniCC`'s entire visible output
//!   hangs off `CreateFrame("Frame", nil, cooldown:GetParent())` — no name at all.
//!
//! Handles are generational, so a destroyed-and-reused slot can never be mistaken for a survivor.
//!
//! ## Three answers, because the interesting one is the middle
//!
//! [`Drew`] separates an addon that built **its own window** from one that **painted over ours**,
//! and that split is usually the most useful thing here: it points straight at the cause. The two
//! addons the director has verified by eye land on opposite sides of it — `!OmniCC` works and is
//! an [`Drew::Overlay`], Bagnon has to build its own slot buttons and was a [`Drew::Nothing`] — and
//! a check that could only see one of the two shapes would have scored the working addon zero.
//!
//! ## What it over- and under-reports, stated rather than hidden
//!
//! - **Over-reports**: any quad from a new widget counts, including one drawn off-screen or under
//!   another window. "Something reached the render list" is not "the player can see it"; the
//!   director's eye is still the judge of that (the contract §7). Over-reporting is the deliberate
//!   direction — a silent under-report is the failure mode this whole column exists to end.
//! - **Under-reports** in one known shape: an addon that changes an *existing* widget in place —
//!   `SetTexture` on one of our regions, `SetBackdrop` on one of our frames — creates no new
//!   handle and scores [`Drew::Nothing`]. Catching that needs a per-quad content diff, which is a
//!   different instrument; it is named here so nobody reads a `nothing` row as proof.
//! - **The world is minimal**, exactly as [`super::drive_session_start`] says: no real bank, no
//!   real raid, no real quests. An addon whose window only opens on state we do not simulate draws
//!   nothing here and would draw in play.
