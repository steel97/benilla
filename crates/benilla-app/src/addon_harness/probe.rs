//! **The read-back column — ask the VM instead of guessing at it.**
//!
//! [`super::survey`] answers *how many* addons work and *what row* each one died on. It cannot
//! answer the next question, which is the one every fix actually turns on: **why is this
//! particular global nil?** The report's `--why` opens the error text; nothing opened the *state*
//! the error was raised against.
//!
//! So this loads **one** addon exactly the way the survey loads it, drives the same session start,
//! and then evaluates Lua of the caller's choosing against the VM that is left standing.
//!
//! ## Two properties it has to have, and both are about not lying
//!
//! **The environment is the corpus's, never the selection's.** The registry every VM is seated
//! with, and the case-folded installed set dependency resolution consults, are built from the
//! *whole folder* — exactly as [`super::survey`] builds them — so probing `KLHThreatMeter` out of
//! a 219-addon root produces the same VM its row in the full run had. Building a registry of one
//! would quietly answer a different question: `GetAddOnInfo` is how AceAddon and AceLibrary find
//! their dependencies, and against a registry of one they take the "nothing is installed" path
//! (the fault [`super::survey`]'s registry comment records at corpus scale).
//!
//! **It stops at session start, before the render and use probes.** Those two drive input into the
//! addon's own frames — hover, click, drag — and standing up the method oracle writes sixteen
//! widgets and a global into the VM. A read taken after them answers "what is true once the
//! harness has finished poking it", which is not the state a player is in and not the state an
//! error was raised in. `ADDON_LOADED` → `VARIABLES_LOADED` → `PLAYER_LOGIN` →
//! `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` + the ticks is the moment this reads, and it is the moment the session
//! column's errors come from.
//!
//! ## What it is worth
//!
//! It is a **debugger, not a measurement**. An eval can mutate the VM, so nothing here prints a
//! column and no number from a probe run belongs in a record — quote [`super::survey`] for that.
