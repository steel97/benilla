//! **The addon corpus harness** (1188 phase 6) — load every addon in a folder, one at a time, and
//! report what happened as numbers that can be re-read on any day.
//!
//! 1188 asks for a harness rather than a one-off, and the reason is in its own closing line:
//! *"that harness plus phase 0's coverage script are this arc's instruments, and they are what
//! make the remaining work a list instead of an argument."* `scripts/api-coverage.sh` answers
//! *what surface do we present*; this answers *what does that surface actually carry*.
//!
//! ## One VM per addon, deliberately
//!
//! Every addon is surveyed in a **fresh** [`UiScript`] with our own FrameXML loaded underneath it.
//! That costs a full UI load per addon and buys the only property that makes the report readable:
//! one addon's failure cannot be another's. Loading them all into one VM means the first addon to
//! leave a global in a bad state gets blamed for the next twenty, and the distribution 1188 asks
//! for stops meaning anything.
//!
//! **What one VM per addon costs, stated because it bounds every number here.** The real client
//! loads every addon into ONE Lua state, so a library embedded in *any* addon's `Libs\` is global
//! for every addon that loads after it. Here it is not. An addon that ships no libraries and relies
//! on a sibling's copy — `FuBar_CustomMenuFu` ships one Lua file and calls
//! `AceLibrary("Tablet-2.0")`, which no addon it can reach provides — fails in this survey and
//! would work in a real session. **So the headline is a floor, not an estimate**, and a
//! `Cannot find a library instance of X` row is this limitation before it is a gap of ours. The
//! isolation is still the right trade (see above: one addon's failure must not be another's); it
//! is the reporting that has to say so. Pinned by
//! [`dependency_tests::a_sibling_addons_embedded_library_is_invisible`].
//!
//! The FrameXML underneath is not optional either — an addon calls `UIDropDownMenu_Initialize` and
//! `GameTooltip_SetDefaultAnchor` as readily as it calls `UnitName`, and roughly half of what looks
//! like "the WoW API" is Lua the client ships (decision 1190: 1,100 engine functions vs 1,075
//! FrameXML ones). Surveying against a bare VM would report most of FrameXML as missing.
//!
//! ## What "missing" means here, and what it does not
//!
//! [`AddonReport::missing_globals`] is a **static** read: the names the addon's own source calls
//! like functions, minus everything the loaded VM has, minus what the addon defines itself. It is
//! deliberately not a runtime trace, because an addon's API calls overwhelmingly happen in
//! handlers that only fire in a live session — a load-time trace would report almost nothing and
//! read as success.
//!
//! The cost of that choice, stated rather than hidden: it over-reports. A name reached only on a
//! path the addon never takes still counts, and a name built at runtime (`getglobal("Unit"..verb)`)
//! is invisible to it. So the list is a **prioritisation signal**, exactly like
//! `api-coverage.sh`'s — read the ranked aggregate, not any single row, and never quote it as a
//! pass rate.
//!
//! There are **three** such lists and they rank three different queues, never merged (1207):
//! [`AddonReport::missing_globals`] is functions to write in Rust, [`AddonReport::missing_tables`]
//! is FrameXML to transcribe, and [`AddonReport::missing_methods`] is widget bindings. The third
//! arrived last and had been invisible the longest — a method is not a global, so nothing here
//! could rank one, and the error row that carried them collapsed the name away.
//!
//! The method queue then turned out to be **two** questions, not one (decision 1228):
//! `missing_methods` asks whether *any* widget answers a name, which is blind to a verb wired to
//! one class and forgotten on its sibling — `MessageFrame:AddMessage` scored zero on it while three
//! corpus addons had exactly that call as their first load error.
//! [`AddonReport::kind_missing_methods`] asks the question the addon asked, by typing the receiver
//! of the call site; [`AddonReport::ambiguous_methods`] is what the typing could not reach, printed
//! rather than swallowed.
//!
//! ## Running it
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -q -p benilla-app --example addon_harness -- <folder of addons>
//! ```

    //
    //     -- Atlas.lua:326
    //     if (event == "ADDON_LOADED" and arg1 == "Atlas") then Atlas_Init(); end
    //
    // `Atlas_Init` is what assigns `AtlasOptions` (l.199). Firing only the SURVEYED addon's name
    // meant that guard never passed for a dependency, so `FuBar_AtlasFu` met an Atlas that had
    // loaded its files and never initialised — and died at `AtlasButton.lua:30` on a nil
    // `AtlasOptions`, a fault the survey then recorded against FuBar_AtlasFu. The state the real
    // client presents was never reachable.
    //
    // Fired BEFORE the error mark, deliberately: a dependency's own handler raising is the
    // dependency's row, not its consumers'. That is this module's stated rule for load errors
    // (`load_dependencies`) and there is no reason session errors should differ — charging it here
    // would count one library's fault once per addon that embeds it, which is the whole reason
    // one-VM-per-addon exists.
    //
    // **Attribution is by the RAISING CHUNK now, not by which event window the raise fell in**
    // (decision 1226 — recorded when this was still window-based, fixed here). The window proxy
    // broke on the shape it was written for: AceAddon drains its ENTIRE `nextAddon` queue on any
    // `ADDON_LOADED` it sees (`AceAddon-2.0.lua:104-105`) and calls each consumer's
    // `OnInitialize` there (`:230`). So the SURVEYED addon's own code runs inside a DEPENDENCY's
    // window, and firing deps outside the mark charged those raises to nobody — the whole
    // FuBar/Ace family was silently OVER-reported as surviving. `Region:SetParent` landing made
    // FuBar_FuXPFu flip `ok -> fail` and that looked like a regression; it was this.
    //
    // Every `ADDON_LOADED` fires inside the mark now, and the dependency exemption is applied
    // afterwards by asking WHOSE FILE raised. Chunk names have been truthful since 1217
    // (`@Interface\AddOns\<Folder>\<File>`), which is what makes the honest key available at all.

    /// section). The cost is exactly this: an addon that ships no libraries and leans on a
    /// sibling's copy fails here and would work in a real session.
    ///
    /// Drawn from `FuBar_CustomMenuFu`, which ships one Lua file, declares
    /// `## OptionalDeps: Ace2, FuBar`, and calls `AceLibrary("Tablet-2.0")` — a library neither
    /// installed addon provides. Five corpus addons sit behind that row, and none of them is a gap
    /// of ours.
    /// **Every addon in the VM gets its own `ADDON_LOADED`, with its OWN name in `arg1`.**
    ///
    /// The survey fired exactly one, carrying the SURVEYED addon's folder. A dependency's
    /// initialiser is almost always gated on its own name — `Atlas.lua:326` is
    /// `if (event == "ADDON_LOADED" and arg1 == "Atlas") then Atlas_Init(); end`, and `Atlas_Init`
    /// is what assigns `AtlasOptions` (l.199) — so a dependency loaded its files and never
    /// initialised. `FuBar_AtlasFu` then died at `AtlasButton.lua:30` on a nil `AtlasOptions`, and
    /// the survey recorded that against FuBar_AtlasFu. **The state was one the real client never
    /// produces**, and it cost 11 addons of the session-start column.
    ///
    /// The second assertion is the half that keeps the rule this module already states: a
    /// dependency's OWN handler raising is the dependency's row, never its consumers'. Those
    /// events fire outside the error-capture window, so one library's fault cannot be counted once
    /// per addon that embeds it.
    /// **A consumer's OWN code raising inside a DEPENDENCY's window is the consumer's row.**
    ///
    /// 1226's finding, now enforced. `AceAddon-2.0.lua:104-105` drains its entire `nextAddon` queue
    /// on ANY `ADDON_LOADED` it sees and calls each consumer's `OnInitialize` there (`:230`). So
    /// the surveyed addon's own file runs inside a dependency's window — and while attribution was
    /// by window, those raises were charged to nobody and the whole FuBar/Ace family read as
    /// surviving when it was not.
    ///
    /// Attribution is by the raising CHUNK now, which 1217 made truthful. The fixture is AceAddon's
    /// shape reduced: the library drains a queue on the first ADDON_LOADED it sees, whoever it
    /// names, and the consumer's callback raises from the consumer's own file.
