//! **The glue layer's one dialog** — the reference's shared `GlueDialog`.
//!
//! `GlueDialog.xml` is a `GlueParent` child, not a screen: `GlueDialog_Show` texts it, sizes it to
//! its content and `Show()`s it over whichever glue screen happens to be up, and every screen
//! raises the same frame through `OPEN_STATUS_DIALOG`. The realm list is built the same way and
//! for the same reason (2072).
//!
//! Ours lived inside [`crate::login`] until 2084, because the login screen was the only thing that
//! had ever needed one. That stopped being true when a refused *character* login had to be said on
//! the select screen (2071): the choice was a second copy of the widget over there, or this — the
//! move `crate::glue`'s own charter asks for, so "what the screens share" cannot fork.
//!
//! **The split, and where the line is.** This module owns the *widget*: the tree, the text, the
//! spawn/despawn, which key answers which button, the click sound. It does not own what a press
//! *means* — a realmlist Okay that refuses a bad address and stays open, a status Cancel that
//! abandons a login attempt in flight. Those belong to the screen that opened the dialog, so a
//! press is published as [`GlueDialogAnswer`] and answered by [`crate::login::answer_dialog`].
//! The one exception is [`DialogKind::Error`], whose entire behaviour is "say a thing, and its
//! Okay dismisses it" — [`drive_glue_dialog`] ends those itself, which is what lets a screen raise
//! one without also writing its ending.
//!
//! [`drive_glue_dialog`] runs inside **each screen's own chain** rather than being hoisted out
//! with a `before`/`after` pair. That is not a style choice: the shared painters
//! ([`crate::glue::art_swaps`] and friends) sit in those chains, and ordering this both after a
//! screen's input and before those painters from outside makes a painter transitively ordered
//! against its own `SystemTypeSet`, which Bevy rejects at schedule build. It panics at boot, and
//! no unit test can see it (2071).
