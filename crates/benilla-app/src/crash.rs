//! **A crash leaves an artefact** (decision 2266 §B2).
//!
//! Until this module, a panic printed to stderr and the process was gone — and with it everything
//! a reporter could have attached. The only log sink was the terminal; a packaged Windows build
//! has no console; of bug B390's four reporters one attached a backtrace, because he had set
//! `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` on his own. `shutdown.rs` says the other half out loud: *"A crash, a
//! `SIGKILL`, a wedged teardown. Nothing survives those."*
//!
//! [`install`] chains a panic hook in front of Rust's default one. The default still prints to
//! stderr exactly as before (so every log a session already greps keeps reading the same); then
//! the report goes to **`benilla-config/Diagnostics/crash-<unix-seconds>.txt`**, resolved through
//! [`crate::local_state`] like every other file benilla writes (the one-folder rule, 0954/1175 —
//! never a platform log dir, never beside the install). The file carries: the build id (the sha
//! is the version, `build_id`), the time and the uptime, the thread, the panic's location and
//! payload, a backtrace captured **regardless of `RUST_BACKTRACE`**, and the last
//! [`benilla_world::log_ring::CAPACITY`] log lines — the minute before, which is what turns a
//! symptom into a story. The path is printed to stderr as the last line, so "attach the file it
//! names" is the whole instruction to a reporter.
//!
//! **What it does not cover, said out loud.** A non-unwinding panic — an allocation failure's
//! abort, a `panic` inside a `Drop` during unwinding, a foreign frame — never reaches any hook;
//! B390's own was one (`thread caused non-unwinding panic. aborting.`). The hook covers the
//! unwinding class (B88, B130, B260, B383's shape: four of the six panics the ledger holds).
//! Flushing saved variables and the CVar diff from inside a panic is a second, riskier item —
//! the world is half-torn by then — and is deliberately not bundled here (2265 §B2).
//!
//! A hermetic capture run (`local_state::home()` answers `None`) writes no file and loses
//! nothing: the harness already has stderr.
