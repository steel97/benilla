//! Sharpening the V-plate frame border (decision 0188).
//!
//! The frame art `Interface\Tooltips\Nameplate-Border` is a **128 × 32** BLP. The plate frame is
//! `0.1 × 0.025` gx; past the 1024×768 knee (and always on a retina framebuffer) it is drawn
//! *larger* than 128 × 32, so the UI pass's bilinear sampler **magnifies** the bitmap — the 1 px
//! gold bevel smears across several soft pixels (the director's "blurry border").
//!
//! The director's call (2026-07-07): keep the **exact same art**, just make it sharper — not a
//! redraw. So we resample the BLP's own pixels to the plate's physical size with **sharp bilinear**:
//! flat within each source texel, a ~1-output-pixel anti-aliased ramp at texel boundaries. Same
//! colours, same proportions, same socket — but crisp edges instead of a full-texel gradient. The
//! result is uploaded as the border texture and drawn 1:1 (see [`super::drive_vplates`], which
//! regenerates it only when the plate's physical size changes).

/// Resample `src` (an `sw × sh` sRGB RGBA8 image) to `dw × dh` with sharp bilinear. Interpolates in
/// **premultiplied** sRGB so alpha edges don't dark-fringe. On magnification the per-axis boundary
/// ramp is compressed to ~1 output pixel (crisp); on minification it falls back to plain bilinear
/// (`sharpen = max(scale, 1)`), so a plate smaller than native still resolves cleanly.
