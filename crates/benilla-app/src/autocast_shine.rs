//! The **autocast shine** — the flaming rim that runs round an autocasting pet button — drawn
//! natively on the UI quad APPEND lane (decisions 1383, 1386; ledger B282, B228).
//!
//! ## Why native (B282)
//!
//! Until 1383 the shine was ~92 script-layer `Texture` regions per button, `SetPoint`ed every
//! frame from a Lua `OnUpdate`. Moving a region dirties the layout epoch, so the first layout
//! getter later in the same tick forced a real anchor solve — whose cost is the whole-roster
//! preamble + fingerprint walk, NOT the ~92 moved leaves (decision 1350 scopes the *rounds*, not
//! the gate walk) — and the seeds-grown law forced a second full walk before the gate could
//! close. Measured at the SW gates pin on a default roster: **+4.25 ms cpu/frame for ONE
//! autocasting button**, spark-count-independent (23 sparks cost the same as 92), scaling with
//! the whole UI (an addon-laden roster pays multiples — nazriel's ~11 ms, B282). The reference
//! never pays any of this: its shine is a `<Model>` widget playing an M2 *outside* the FrameXML
//! layout tree. This module is that architecture on our substrate: the script layer carries one
//! **token texture** per button ([`SHINE_TOKEN`], shown/hidden on the autocast *edge*), the
//! extract's conversion records where it sits ([`ShineSite`] — the minimap-slot pattern), and
//! [`emit_shine`] appends the spark quads per frame with zero layout traffic: a shine-only frame
//! leaves the script pipeline fully settled.
//!
//! ## What is drawn — the M2's own law
//!
//! The reference's "autocast is on" mark is a `<Model>` playing
//! `Interface\Buttons\UI-AutoCastButton.mdx`; what that model actually is came out of the shipped
//! .m2 with `benilla-extract m2bones`/`m2part` (this block moved whole from `PetActionBar.xml`,
//! which owned the drawing until 1383):
//!
//! - 4 bones, pivoting at the corners of a 0.02 × 0.02 model-unit square, each keyed with the
//!   SAME 5-key 2.000 s translation loop walking the square edge by edge (0.5 s per edge), the
//!   four phase-shifted by one corner each so they chase one another round it. The tracks are
//!   `interp == 1`, LINEAR: constant speed along each edge, no easing into the corners.
//! - 4 particle emitters, one per bone: 300/s, life 1.000 s, Add blend, unlit, texture
//!   `Interface\Buttons\GlowStar.blp`, size half-extent 0.005 → 0.0015 → 0.001 over life, colour
//!   (0.976,0.875,0.192,1) → (0.996,0.945,0.745,1) → (1,1,1,0). The spline's 4 control points are
//!   ALL at the origin — a particle never travels: it is born where the bone is and shrinks away
//!   there. The effect is four comet trails running round the button's rim, not a rotating ring.
//!
//! MODEL UNITS → FrameXML units is the widget's own projection, not a calibration (wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/modelframe-animation-clock.md`, decision 1321's fold-back): the ortho leg
//! collapses to **1280 × modelScale × layoutScale** FrameXML units per model unit, independent of
//! aspect and resolution; `scale=` on the ref's `<Model>` is SetModelScale, and the model ORIGIN
//! is the frame rect's BOTTOM-LEFT, which is why a square authored 0..0.02 lands across the whole
//! rect instead of in one quadrant.
//!
//! **The `<Model>`'s rect and scale are per-TEMPLATE, and the reference does not repeat itself**
//! (decision 1391) — which is why they ride the [`ShineSite`] and not a constant:
//!
//! - **pet button** — `setAllPoints` on 30×30 at `scale="1.2"`: the path is **30.72 units**,
//!   1.024× the button, overhanging its top and right by 2.4% and clipped there.
//! - **spell book button** — its own `<Size>36×36</Size>` at `CENTER (1,1)` on a 37×37 button, at
//!   `scale="1.22"`: the path is **31.232 units** inside a 36-unit rect that itself sits 1.5 units
//!   in from the button's bottom-left.
//!
//! **The stars on that path do NOT take the same projection** ([`STAR`], decisions 1386/1390):
//! their half-extent is an EYE-SPACE length added after the transform, so it misses `modelScale`
//! — the square is scaled by 1.2 and the stars standing on it are not — and, unlike the square,
//! it keeps the ortho leg's aspect term: `2 · half · √(W² + H²)` **window px**, free of UI scale
//! and frame scale. 12.80 px at 1024×768; 14.69 at 1280×720. 1386 froze the 4:3 case into a
//! constant, which is why our 16:9 stars were 22 % small until 1390.
//!
//! **"Free of UI scale" is byte-law, not a loose phrase** (wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/modelframe-uiscale-law.md`, a §5 cross-check dispatched *because* the
//! phrasing looked too loose to rest on). `uiScale` is an ordinary `SetScale` on the frame named
//! `UIParent` (`0x494550` → `0x76ac10(ecx = [0xb4b44c])`, and `0x494590` "GetUiScale" is literally
//! `fld [[0xb4b44c]+0x7c]`), and it *does* reach both the widget's rect and the model root
//! (`76d1dd fmul [esi+0x7c]`). It cancels anyway: `0x76d240` builds the ortho `m00 = 2/w` **and**
//! the viewport from the SAME rect, so px per eye unit is `√(W² + H²)` whatever `w` is. So:
//!
//! > **the button scales with the dial and the star does not.** At 2560×1440 a newborn star is
//! > **29.37 px at every setting**, against a 37-unit button of 69.4 / 62.4 / 44.4 px at `uiScale`
//! > 1.0 / 0.9 / 0.64 — 42 % / 47 % / **66 %** of the button.
//!
//! And the consequence that actually reads on screen is not that ratio but this: the four emitters
//! sit on a path that DOES shrink with the dial (`31.2 · uiScale` units), so at 0.64 four
//! fixed-size 29 px stars pack into a 37 px square instead of a 59 px one and **overlap into one
//! blob**. Every bit of that is the reference's own behaviour; there is nothing to fix here, and a
//! low-`uiScale` complaint about this widget is a taste call, not a defect.
//!
//! **And the widget is its own scissor** ([`site_quads`], decision 1387): a `<Model>` installs its
//! frame rect as the VIEWPORT for the duration of its draw and restores it after, so the model
//! cannot paint one pixel outside the button. With the path running on the rim and the stars
//! straddling it, that clip is half the silhouette — the reference's flat outer edge with the
//! flames licking inward, against the soft halo an unclipped draw hangs round the whole button.
//!
//! **We draw the authored population, not a sample of it** (decision 1386). `rate × life` is
//! 300 live particles per emitter, 1200 for the model, and that number IS the look: the bone
//! lays one down every 0.205 units of rim while a newborn star is 12.8 units across at 4:3 (more
//! on a widescreen — [`STAR`]), so ~62 of them pile onto any point of the band and ADD saturates
//! it into one continuous flaming rim —
//! unevenly by channel (the ramp is gold, so R and G clip where B does not, which is why it
//! reads gold and not white), and what travels is the brightness envelope, not any one star.
//! 1383 shipped a 23-sample stand-in for that population, chosen to keep the *coverage*
//! unbroken, and coverage was the wrong invariant: the samples tile the same path at 1/13th the
//! intensity, so the band came apart into legible marching sparkles (B228, the director's A/B
//! against the reference). Sampling saved cost the script layer was charging us; native, the
//! authored count is affordable, so there is nothing left to approximate.
//!
//! ## The clock — truncation and all
//!
//! The reference does NOT play this loop at wall-clock rate (decision 1321, B228's second round):
//! `CSimpleModel` advances its private scene clock by `__ftol(elapsed * 1000.0)` — truncated,
//! no fractional carry (`0x76d846`; the WORLD driver adds 0.5 first, `0x48366b`) — so a 2000 ms
//! band takes `2000·T/floor(T)` ms at frame time T ms: 2083 ms at 60 fps, 2315 at 144, never
//! less than 2000. [`ShineClock`] is that integer-millisecond accumulator, advanced the
//! reference's way. All shine sites share one clock: the ref's per-button Models are all created
//! at UI load with `SetSequence(0)` and never drift, the loop being exact — one shared clock IS
//! that behaviour.
