//! **The melee swing refusal** — what the client does with the server's answers to a
//! `CMSG_ATTACKSWING` it will not honour.
//!
//! **Six opcodes, FOUR arms.** `0x145` NOTINRANGE and `0x146` BADFACING take one each; `0x148`
//! DEADTARGET and `0x149` CANT_ATTACK share arm 4 verbatim; `0x147` NOTSTANDING is never wired at
//! all; and `0x14e` `SMSG_CANCEL_COMBAT` — the forced cancel, registered by the *spell* TU
//! (`0x5e3308` → handler `0x5e7dd0`), which is why `0x625520`'s eight-opcode census never names it
//! — is arm 4's body **byte-identical**, down to the `__LINE__` it pushes. So the whole family is
//! two arms that latch a message and two that silently stop the attack.
//!
//! The server refuses a swing on the **edge** alone (vmangos `Unit::AttackerStateUpdate`'s
//! `swingError` switch, `Objects/Unit.cpp:405-475`: each arm sends only when
//! `GetLastSwingErrorMsg() != <result>`), so a player standing out of range gets **one** packet,
//! not one per swing timer. The repeat the player actually sees is the client's own, and it is a
//! **latch plus a cooldown**, never a per-packet toast:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x625a8a  (0x145 NOTINRANGE)  ecx = 1 ; call 0x5ecdb0     ; latch code 1
//! 0x625aa1  (0x146 BADFACING)   ecx = 2 ; call 0x5ecdb0     ; latch code 2
//! 0x625ab8  (0x148 DEADTARGET / 0x149 CANT_ATTACK)          ; NO message — StopAttack, nothing else
//!
//! 0x5ecdb0  [0xc4d758] = code ; [0xc4c270] = OsGetAsyncTimeMs()    ; the code + "show at"
//!
//! 0x5ec950  the local player's tick:
//!             this is the active player      (0x468550)      else out
//!             [this+0xc48] != 0              (0x47bf60)      else out   ; an attack target is set
//!             now - [0xc4c270] >= 0          (5ec999 js)     else out
//!             [0xc4d758] == 1 -> DisplayError(0xd8) | == 2 -> DisplayError(0xd7) | else out
//!             [0xc4c270] = now + 0xfa0                                  ; re-arm, 4000 ms
//! ```
//!
//! Three consequences, all of them visible, none of them guessable from the packet alone:
//!
//! 1. **The first line is immediate** — the latch writes `now`, and the tick's test is
//!    `now - stored >= 0`, so the very next tick shows it.
//! 2. **It repeats every 4 s while the refusal stands**, because nothing about the *packet*
//!    drives the display; the latch does, and it survives until something clears it.
//! 3. **A dead or unattackable target says nothing at all.** `0x148` and `0x149` share arm 4
//!    verbatim — the client cannot even tell them apart — and that arm raises no message on any
//!    surface: it resolves the active player and calls StopAttack
//!    ([`crate::creature_anim::stop_attack_local`]) on it. Which is right: the target is dead or
//!    friendly, the attack ends, and the reason is already on screen from elsewhere.
//!
//! **What clears the latch is a landed swing.** `SMSG_ATTACKERSTATEUPDATE`'s arm calls `0x5ea800`
//! (at `0x6259b6`) when the attacker **is the active player** (`0x5fa6d0`, a guid compare against
//! `0x468550`) and the **victim resolves** as a streamed unit — and `0x5ea800`'s first act, ahead
//! of everything else it does, is `0x5ecdb0(0)`. So the moment a swing connects the stale "too far
//! away" stops repeating; while none does, it keeps saying so. `0x5e2510`, a module init, clears
//! it the same way.
//!
//! Both edges ride ONE message ([`SwingRefusalEdge`]) written by two arms of the same net drain,
//! so they are consumed in **packet order** — the reference processes them in one synchronous
//! dispatch, and a refusal and a landing that arrive in the same frame must not be reordered.
//!
//! Two consequences of the latch being written **unconditionally** — both reproduced here, both
//! easy to lose in a refactor:
//!
//! - a **second** refusal packet resets the deadline to `now`, so it **defeats the 4 s cooldown**
//!   and re-shows on the next tick; a NOTINRANGE→BADFACING flip shows at once for the same reason;
//! - the **re-arm precedes the print** (`0x5ec9bc` then `0x5ec9c2`), so the 4 s advance happens
//!   even when the line is then swallowed by a missing GlobalString.
//!
//! `SMSG_ATTACKSWING_NOTSTANDING` (`0x147`) is in neither this module nor
//! [`benilla_protocol::messages::opcode`]: the reference never registers it, and vmangos never
//! sends it (`Player::SendAttackSwingNotStanding` has zero callers).
//!
//! Whole seam §5-verified in wow-re `object-layer/scratch/attackswing-refusal-law.md` (decision
//! 2037), which corrected three prior glosses of these same addresses.
