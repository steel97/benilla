//! **The cover takes the input plane.** While the loading screen covers the frame, benilla accepts
//! no mouse and no keyboard: no hover, no cursor classification, no click, no keybinding, no
//! camera, no movement. One system, at the source, so *nothing under the cover has to know the
//! cover exists*.
//!
//! ## The reference does this too, and it does it at the source
//!
//! This file was written on the assumption that the reference simply blocks inside its world load,
//! so the question never arises there. The wow-re round behind decision 1990 says otherwise, and
//! the answer is better than the assumption: **the reference has an explicit input veto, registered
//! by the screen's own raise.**
//!
//! `0x406800` (the raise) ends `0x4068e0 call 0x4069e0`, which registers the three-byte stub
//! `0x406a50` — `xor eax,eax; ret` — on event-bus categories **1, 8 (key down), 0xa (auto-repeat),
//! 0xb (button down) and 0xc (mouse move)** at priority **8.0f**; `0x407e80` (the dismiss)
//! unregisters all five. The dispatcher `0x4245b0` stops its walk on a zero return (`0x4246ad`),
//! and every `CSimpleTop` input handler sits at 1.0f — so those five categories never reach the
//! interface at all while the screen is up. Category 0xc's registrant is `UpdateMouseFocus`
//! (`0x7660d0`) itself, so the veto stops the pointer resolver outright: **the cursor freezes.**
//! Key-up, button-up, the wheel, category 0x10 and `WM_ACTIVATE` are deliberately let through.
//!
//! So the shape below is the reference's shape — one veto at the source, not a condition on each
//! consumer — arrived at independently and then confirmed. Two deliberate differences, named
//! rather than drifted into:
//!
//! - **We swallow the wheel and the up edges too.** The up edges are equivalent by outcome: the
//!   reference's held key comes back **released** anyway (`0x4908c0 → 0x49093c → 0x5144c0` zeroes
//!   the movement mask on world-enter, and a still-held key cannot re-arm it — it reclassifies to
//!   the vetoed auto-repeat category), which is exactly what the release edge below produces. The
//!   wheel is a real deviation: in the reference a notch under the loading screen still zooms the
//!   camera you cannot see. Swallowing it is the director's "nothing through the screen", and it
//!   costs a zoom nobody asked for.
//! - **We clear the world pick; the reference leaves it running at the frozen point.** `0x481790`
//!   hangs off the layer walk rather than the bus, so it keeps picking — and in the two windows
//!   where a world is populated (before `SMSG_NEW_WORLD`, and again once the new player object
//!   exists) it *can* set a context cursor under the screen. It is invisible there only because the
//!   pointer cannot move. Ours is strictly quieter and observably identical.
//!
//! ## Why this is a source cut and not a run condition
//!
//! The obvious way to build it is a run condition per input system. That is the way it regresses:
//! the census behind this module counted **fifty-one** places raw input enters the app, more than
//! half of them with no state gate of any kind — the whole `target::TargetUpdate` pick chain
//! included, which is the one the director caught. Every one of them would have had to remember,
//! and every future one would have to remember too. The director's report was exactly a thing
//! nobody remembered: the world pick ran under the cover, found a unit, and the *hardware cursor
//! changed to the sword* over art the player was only waiting on.
//!
//! So the cut is at the source, in `PreUpdate`, after `bevy::input::InputSystems` has built this
//! frame's input and before anything reads it. A consumer written a year from now is covered
//! without knowing this file exists — which is the only property that survives a multi-year
//! codebase.
//!
//! ## The four things it takes, and what makes the pointer half work
//!
//! 1. **The button planes** — `ButtonInput<KeyCode>`/`<Key>`/`<MouseButton>`. See [`swallow`] for
//!    the exact rule: a press that arrives under the cover never happened, and anything held from
//!    *before* the cover is released once, with a real release edge, so a gesture already in
//!    flight (a mouselook session, a held `MOVEFORWARD` binding, an armed UI drag) unwinds through
//!    the path it already has for a released button instead of being stranded down forever.
//! 2. **The raw message queues** — `KeyboardInput`, `MouseButtonInput`, `MouseMotion`,
//!    `MouseWheel`, `CursorMoved` — drained, because a `MessageReader` reads the queue, not the
//!    button state (`feed_ui_input`'s character/EditBox feed and the glue screens all read raw).
//! 3. **The accumulators** — `AccumulatedMouseMotion`/`AccumulatedMouseScroll`, which
//!    `InputSystems` builds from those same messages and which the camera and the wheel bindings
//!    poll rather than read.
//! 4. **The pointer position itself**, which is the half a message drain cannot reach: a hit-test
//!    does not read an event, it reads `Window::cursor_position()`, a *field*. So the cover blanks
//!    it and restores it on the way out ([`CoveredPointer`]).
//!
//! That fourth one is the load-bearing trick, and it is not a hack: **"the pointer is not in the
//! window" is a state every pointer consumer in the client already implements correctly**, because
//! it is the ordinary alt-tabbed-away case. `update_hover`/`update_hovered_object` clear
//! [`crate::target::Hovered`] and return; `update_pick_occlusion` leaves the ray at infinity;
//! `classify_cursor` then reads an empty pick and settles on Point; `feed_ui_input` takes its
//! `pointer_left_window()` arm, which leaves the hovered frame (one `OnLeave`) and disarms any
//! press/drag; bevy's own `ui_focus_system` clears every `Interaction`, so `glue_clicks` goes
//! quiet with it. Not one of those had to be told about loading screens.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does not take
//!
//! **Synthetic input.** The capture probes press into the same `ButtonInput` resources — but they
//! do it in `Update`, after this system, and the pointer probes drive
//! `ui_script::SyntheticPointer` rather than the window. An instrument driving the client is the
//! operator, not the player. The two probe writers that *do* run in `PreUpdate` order themselves
//! [`after`](CoverInput) this set so the relationship is written down rather than left ambiguous.
//!
//! **The cursor's own art.** Parking it at the plain arrow and dropping any item/spell overlay is
//! the reference's `0x6e4940` (cursor index 1, set *before* the screen goes up), and it lives with
//! the cursor in [`crate::cursor`] rather than here — it is an output, not a channel.
//!
//! **Nothing else.** There is no dev exemption: the debug panel, the perf pill, the inspector and
//! their chords go quiet under the cover along with everything else. That is a real cost — a stuck
//! load is exactly when you want the instruments — and it is deliberate, because the alternative
//! is a keycode allowlist, and a keycode handed to the dev plane is also a keycode handed to the
//! keybinding table. The diagnosis path for a stuck load is the wait instrument
//! ([`super::WAIT_LOG_AFTER`]), which names the blocking term without anyone touching a key.

/// # `set_physical_cursor_position` MOVES THE MOUSE (decision 2090)
///
/// The load-bearing fact, because the name does not say it and getting it wrong shipped a bug for

/// "put the pointer there".** It writes `Window.internal.physical_cursor_position`, and
/// `bevy_winit::system::changed_windows` turns *any* change of that field to a `Some` into
/// `winit_window.set_cursor_position(…)` — `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` on macOS, a real hardware
/// warp. There is no bookkeeping-only setter; this field is bevy's cursor-warp API, and winit is
/// its only other writer.
///
/// So the hand-back cannot simply write what it stashed. It used to, and the pointer was yanked
/// across the screen on every cover drop: measured on 2026-09-08 across a live `/logout`, the
/// restore wrote `(811.9, 1242.6)` physical and the hardware cursor teleported from `(308, 588)`
/// to `(406, 621)` points in the same millisecond. The stash goes stale over exactly the frames a
/// cover is up for — a world teardown is one ~283 ms frame during which no events are pumped at
/// all — so the pointer landed wherever it had been when the world went away, which after a click
/// on the centred game menu's Logout is the middle of the window.
