//! Physics **collision layers** — the two collision *audiences* the world geometry is queried by.
//!
//! The player body and the third-person camera collide against *different* sets of WMO faces (a
//! binary-VERIFIED 1.12.1 fact; see `benilla_formats`'s MOPY mask doc and wow-5875-re
//! `system/collision/collision.md`): the **walking** gather drops DETAIL faces (`0x04`), the
//! **camera/LOS** gather instead drops NOCAMCOLLIDE faces (`0x02`) — so the camera collides with
//! visible decals/overhangs (forge pipes, low beams) the player walks *under*, and passes through
//! NOCAMCOLLIDE faces the player still stands on. avian can't filter a single trimesh per-face, so
//! each WMO bakes two colliders, separated by these layers; the player and camera queries pick their
//! audience by mask. Everything else — terrain, doodads, GameObjects — sits on the default layer and is
//! collided by **both** (so it needs no explicit layer).
