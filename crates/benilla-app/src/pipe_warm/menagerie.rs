// The warm pass — the fix half of 0837, widened by 0937.
//
// The 0837 inventory (pipes1.log) showed the model lane's REACHABLE pipeline space is small once
// the batch-order axis left the key: 4 vertex layouts × the blend/depth-flag families, ~28
// observed in a wilderness-to-Stormwind leg. 0937 added the spaces 0837 left out — the
// shard-rung buckets and far-side-of-water twins of that same model lane, and the sky/water
// lanes (celestial discs/glares, stars, cloud dome, gradient dome, WMO skybox, liquid), each of
// which had fired the tripwire as a director-felt live stall. The menagerie below compiles the
// whole space behind the entry loading cover — one 1 cm rig per variant, parented to the world
// camera (the camera renders under the cover, 0540, so every rig's draw queues its pipeline
// through the production specialize path), the cover held (via `WarmPass::satisfied` in the
// loading screen's clear condition) until the cache drains, then the rigs despawn. A variant
// this misses shows up as the tripwire's "compiled LIVE" warn — extend the loops, don't guess.

/// The sky/water lanes' material stores, grouped so [`run_warm_pass`] stays under Bevy's
/// system-param arity. Every store here is populated at `Startup` by its own subsystem (the
/// celestial rig, the star dome, the cloud dome, the gradient dome, the liquid frame sets), so
/// by the time the menagerie spawns behind the entry cover, iterating the store IS the complete
/// reachable set — warming can never drift from what's spawned. The one exception is the WMO
/// skybox, whose materials are built on first need: its pipeline key is texture-independent, so
/// one representative material covers the lane.
