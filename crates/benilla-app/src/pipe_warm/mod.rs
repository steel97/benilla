//! The pipeline warm pass + its instrument — decision 0837 (the B181 city-approach stall).
//!
//! **Why this exists:** on macOS, Bevy compiles every GPU pipeline **synchronously on the render
//! thread** — `bevy_render`'s `create_pipeline_task` has a `target_os = "macos"` carve-out (0.18
//! and 0.19 both) that `block_on`s the build regardless of `synchronous_pipeline_compilation`,
//! and the Metal half of that build runs out-of-process in `MTLCompilerService` (near-zero
//! process CPU while the frame is blocked). So any pipeline variant first drawn *live* is a
//! frame-long stall the app cannot pace; the only fix is compiling everything where a stall is
//! invisible — behind the loading cover, where 0540 put the warm-up. (The worst offender — the
//! per-batch-index depth bias that made every WMO batch its own pipeline, ~3000 variants at
//! Stormwind — left the pipeline key in this same decision: the nudge now rides `sun_scale.y`
//! into `wow_model.wgsl`'s vertex stage as uniform data.)
//!
//! The pieces:
//!
//! - [`WarmPass`] + `spawn_menagerie` — the warm pass: one tiny rig per reachable pipeline
//!   variant — the model lane with its shard-rung and far-side twins, and the sky/water lanes
//!   (celestial, stars, clouds, gradient dome, WMO skybox, liquid; decision 0945 widened 0837's
//!   model-only scope) — parented to the world camera, spawned a few frames AFTER the entry
//!   cover rises (so the cover is on the glass before the burst, not racing it — 0962); the
//!   loading screen's clear condition holds on [`WarmPass::satisfied`] until the pipeline cache
//!   drains (10 s backstop, 0737's rule), then the menagerie despawns (roots only — recursion
//!   takes the twin booth's children, 0962). Captures skip it.
//!   Booth twins ride a real booth's layer (samples=1, 0938) AND the pass's own twin booth
//!   ([`crate::portrait::spawn_warm_booth`] — the custom-projection view key real bakes install;
//!   decision 0958), and [`warm_effect_lane`] pushes the `wow_effect` lane's whole key cross
//!   through the production stream each warm frame (the ring's first-target stall, 0958).
//! - [`PipeWatch`] — an `Arc` shared by the main and render worlds: how many pipelines the cache
//!   has ever queued, how many have settled (Ok/Err), and whether a cover currently hides the
//!   frame (loading screen up, or not in world — the glue scene is its own cover, 0540).
//! - [`watch_pipelines`] (render world, after the cache's own process step): maintains the
//!   counters and — the permanent tripwire — logs a `warn!` for every pipeline compiled while
//!   **uncovered**. That line firing in a session log IS the regression signal: it means the
//!   menagerie has a coverage hole (extend its loops, don't guess).
//! - `WOW_PIPE_TRACE=<path>` — the inventory dump: one line per pipeline creation (covered or
//!   not) with the full variant identity (shaders, defs, depth bias, blend, write mask, vertex
//!   buffers, cull), the ground truth the menagerie was built from.
//! - Two stream-trace columns (`pipes_new`, `pipes_pending` — see `perf::trace_stream`) so a
//!   compile burst is attributable on the same row as the frame that paid for it.
