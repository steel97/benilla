//! The app-side **aura feed** (decisions 0255/0257): turns the live `UNIT_FIELD_AURA` blocks of
//! our own avatar and of the current target into the ordered [`AuraState`] lists the `UnitAura`
//! bindings read, maintains the reference client's insertion-ordered display cache for the player,
//! joins in the self-only durations, and drains the right-click cancels back to the wire.
//!
//! Two things make this more than a snapshot projection:
//!
//! - **Order is state.** The player's buff bar draws a densely packed cache in *insertion* order that
//!   repacks on removal (`PlayerAuras_Update`, byte-verified — decision 0257). Ascending slot order,
//!   which a fresh descriptor read would give, is a *different* order and would shuffle icons into
//!   recycled slots. So [`PlayerAuraCache`] is carried across frames: survivors keep their position,
//!   a dropped aura closes its gap, a new aura appends at the end.
//! - **Durations arrive out of band, and before the slot is named.** `SMSG_UPDATE_AURA_DURATION`
//!   ([`AuraDurations`], filled by the net apply path) is keyed by raw slot and lands *before* the
//!   `UNIT_FIELD_AURA` delta that says which spell sits there (verified, decision 0257 B6; measured
//!   at one frame, ~50 ms, on a fresh apply — decision 0846). So a stamp's slot is **empty at the
//!   moment it arrives**, and the only thing that may invalidate it is the aura it would be joined
//!   to, never the slot's momentary occupancy: the feed keeps every stamp and gates the *join* on
//!   the aura having appeared no earlier than the packet. That gate is what stops a timer left by a
//!   since-expired occupant showing on the permanent aura that recycled its slot (the reference
//!   avoids this via a DBC "until cancelled" flag we don't parse — decision 0257 §3).
//!
//! And one thing the bar does **not** get from here: the running countdown. Rust recomputes each
//! aura's `expirationTime` every frame, but the event this feed fires is the reference's
//! discrete-change edge (`PLAYER_AURAS_CHANGED`), which a duration refresh does not trip. The
//! reference resolves that the same way — `BuffButton_OnUpdate` re-reads `GetPlayerBuffTimeLeft`
//! **every frame** and caches only the buff *index* on the event — and so does `BuffFrame.xml`.
//! A bar that cached the expiry on the event instead is decision 0846's second defect.
//!
//! Scope: the **local player** (decisions 0255/0257) and the **target** (the target frame's aura
//! rows — 0255's deferred slice). The target's list is the byte-verified *other-unit* law
//! (decision 0257): `UnitBuff`/`UnitDebuff` on another unit read that unit's own `UNIT_FIELD_AURA`
//! straight, **ascending raw slot within the half** — no insertion cache, no durations (the 1.12
//! wire carries none for anyone but yourself). It **does** carry the display filter, though: an aura
//! whose spell is flagged never-display (`NO_AURA_ICON`/`DO_NOT_DISPLAY` — a warrior stance) is
//! hidden on *every* aura display, target rows included, not just the player's own bar (decision
//! 0417, correcting 0268's scope note and wow-re §9 — the director watched the reference hide a
//! target's Battle Stance, which the "other-unit reads straight" reading can't explain: `NO_AURA_ICON`
//! means exactly that, everywhere). A self-target is the one exception in *ordering*: decision 0257 §2
//! resolves the Era API's single `UnitAura` toward the player-bar law under every token, so targeting
//! yourself shows the same insertion-ordered list — filtered identically either way.

/// 2. **The area-aura override.** Only for a *non*-cancelable aura (`test [edi+0xa],0x1; jne` at
