//! The pet action bar's feed + drain — the app side of `benilla_ui::script::pet`'s seam
//! (decision 0982), and the home of [`PetBar`], the server-authoritative state
//! `net/apply/pet.rs` writes.
//!
//! It also feeds the **`"pet"` unit token** and the pet frame's events ([`feed_pet_unit`],
//! decision 0990). That lives here rather than beside the `"player"`/`"target"` feed for one
//! reason: the token's identity is [`PetBar`]'s cached pet guid — the client's `[0xb714a0]`, which
//! is also what `UNIT_PET` fires off (wow-re §9) — so the token and its repaint wire read the same
//! word, from the file that owns it.
//!
//! **The shape of this system is the stance bar's mirror image, and that is the thing to hold on
//! to.** `crate::ui_shapeshift` derives its whole bar locally, from the known-spell set × the
//! `Spell.dbc` catalog, and the server never has an opinion about it. Here the server owns the
//! bar's CONTENTS — which slots exist and what is in them — and hands them over whole in
//! `SMSG_PET_SPELLS`. So the feed does no admission and no ordering: it *renders* the ten words
//! the last packet delivered.
//!
//! **But the bar's STATE — the lit command, the lit reaction, the autocast bit — is applied
//! LOCALLY, and that is forced rather than chosen.** The server answers none of those three
//! presses: `HandlePetAction`'s command and reaction arms send nothing back,
//! `HandlePetSpellAutocastOpcode` sets its bits and returns, and `SMSG_PET_MODE` is emitted from
//! exactly one place in the whole server (`Pet::SetEnabled` — the enabled flag, nothing else). A
//! client that waited for confirmation would show a bar whose reaction buttons never light and
//! whose autocast ring never appears. Verified live against vmangos, 2026-08-05: a
//! `TogglePetAutocast` and a Follow press drew no reply packet at all. [`drain_pet_actions`]
//! carries that half, and the next `SMSG_PET_SPELLS` re-authorities it.
//!
//! **The slot law** (decode and constants in `benilla_protocol::messages::pet`, VERIFIED against
//! the client itself in decision 0988): each slot is one packed word whose type — bits 24–29,
//! **masked** — decides its whole reading:
//!
//! - `PET_ACT_COMMAND 7` — `action` is a `CommandStates`: Stay 0 / Follow 1 / Attack 2 / Dismiss 3.
//!   A token: `GetPetActionInfo` returns the NAMES of two globals rather than values (the
//!   reference's own `PetActionBarFrame.lua:98-104` fork), which `PetActionBar.xml` resolves —
//!   `PET_ACTION_*` out of the shipped `GlobalStrings.lua`, `PET_*_TEXTURE` out of the constants
//!   that file declares and ours quotes.
//! - `PET_ACT_REACTION 6` — `action` is a `ReactStates`: Passive 0 / Defensive 1 / Aggressive 2.
//!   Also a token.
//! - types **1–5** — `action` is a spell id, and the autocast pair rides in bits 31/30 rather than
//!   in the type. That split is why the server's `ACT_PASSIVE`/`ACT_DISABLED`/`ACT_ENABLED` are
//!   one branch here and not three.
//!
//! The two halves of `GetPetActionInfo`'s signature never overlap: `isActive` is a **token**
//! concept and `autoCast*` a **spell** one, each nil on the other's branch.
//!
//! The **3 commands / 4 spells / 3 reactions** arrangement everyone recognises is therefore
//! *server data*, not a layout: it is what `CharmInfo::InitPetActionBar` happens to write, and a
//! possessed minion or a charmed creature arrives with a different mix through the same ten words.
//! Nothing in this file or in `PetActionBar.xml` assumes it.

/// **Only STAY and FOLLOW reach the command write.** The binary's type-7 arm gates it on
/// `action <= 1` (§10.1): DISMISS (3) falls straight through, and ATTACK (2) leaves down the
/// validation chain that ends at `[0xb714b0] = 1` (`0x4bd42e`) — the attack latch, never the
/// command byte. The distinction is the difference between an order and a mode: Stay and Follow
/// are what the pet is *doing until told otherwise*; Attack is a thing you *tell it once*, and its
/// light comes from the latch — which the lit button's own second press, a new pet, and **every
/// change of your target** ([`pet_stop_on_old_target_clear`]) each knock down.
///
/// Getting this wrong is visible within one click: latching ATTACK into the command byte leaves
/// the Attack button lit forever (`isActive`'s state compare keeps matching), blanks Follow and
/// Stay, and survives the `PetStopAttack` that should have put it out.
///
/// Reaching here at all means the press already cleared the client's two ATTACK gates, because
/// [`drain_pet_actions`] runs them first — so the latch is still raised unconditionally, and now
/// that is *correct* rather than a residual. Both gates are carved
/// (`object-layer/scratch/pet-command-validators.md`): `0x612df0` refuses on the **pet's** own
/// state and never reaches the send, and `0x5ee5a0` re-derives the pet from the player's own
/// descriptor. The second is structurally true whenever we hold a bar — the bar's guid *came* from
/// the server naming us this pet's controller — so only the first is a test we can fail.
/// What the `PET_ATTACK_*` field-change callback would see for this unit: `Some(fighting)` when
/// the unit is **ours**, `None` when it is nobody's business of ours and no event may fire.
///
/// Both halves are `0x5ff580`'s, in its order: the owner test at `0x5ff780` first — CHARMEDBY when
/// set, else SUMMONEDBY, which is *not* the fallback `0x5ee5a0` uses for the same-shaped read — and
/// only then the flag at `0x5ff78d`. Reading the flag without the owner test would let any unit in
