//! **Leaving** — the app half of the game menu's Logout and Exit Game buttons (decision 0674):
//! the outbound request, the server's answer, the countdown dialog that narrates it, and the
//! process exit.
//!
//! The whole arc is three packets and one rule: **the server owns the clock, the client only
//! narrates it.** `Logout()` sends `CMSG_LOGOUT_REQUEST`; vmangos
//! (`WorldSession::HandleLogoutRequestOpcode`, read at MiscHandler.cpp:284) answers
//! `SMSG_LOGOUT_RESPONSE {u32 reason, u8 instant}` and that one packet decides everything:
//!
//! - `reason != 0` — **refused**, no logout starts (1 in combat, 3 jumping/falling, 2 GM-frozen).
//! - `reason == 0, instant == 1` — logged out on the spot (resting in an inn or a city, on a taxi,
//!   or a GM-level account — vmangos's `CONFIG_UINT32_INSTANT_LOGOUT`); `SMSG_LOGOUT_COMPLETE`
//!   follows immediately and there is no dialog at all.
//! - `reason == 0, instant == 0` — a **20-second server-side timer** now runs, during which the
//!   character sits and is rooted. This is the case the CAMP dialog counts down, and the case
//!   `CancelLogout()` (`CMSG_LOGOUT_CANCEL` → `SMSG_LOGOUT_CANCEL_ACK`) calls off.
//!
//! Quit is Logout plus one bit of local intent: end the *process* on completion instead of falling
//! back to character select. It is the same wire, the same clock, the same dialog under a different
//! name (QUIT_TIMER "%d %s until exit"), which is why the reference gives QUIT an "Exit now" button
//! and CAMP none — a force-quit needs no server round trip, a force-logout does.
//!
//! **All of it is now pinned** (decision 1821 — this module's three arms were the last INFERRED
//! join left in the leaving path). The wire shape is verified twice over: vmangos's packet
//! (`WorldPackets::Misc::LogoutResponse` — `u32 reason, u8 instant`) and the reference's own
//! handler (`0x5b4630`: `GetInt32` then `GetUInt8`, then a virtual `[vtable+0x54](reason,
//! instant)`, which is `[0x80a398+0x54]` = `0x5aaef0`). That override is this decision table byte
//! for byte:
//!
//! - `0x5aaef6 test eax,eax / jne 0x5aaf21` → **any** non-zero reason takes one arm:
//!   `DisplayError(0x180)` = `ERR_LOGOUT_FAILED`, then clear the pending flag. There is no
//!   per-reason string — combat, falling and GM-frozen all show the one line.
//! - `0x5aaf00 test eax,eax / jne` → `instant != 0` returns having done nothing; the completion
//!   is already on its way.
//! - otherwise `setne cl` on `[this+0x1b1c]`, `add ecx,0x114`, `SignalEvent` → event **276
//!   `PLAYER_CAMPING`** or **277 `PLAYER_QUITING`**, and `[this+0x1b1c]` is written from the
//!   logout *request*'s own quit flag at `0x5ab053`. The reference remembers camp-vs-quit in one
//!   local byte, which is exactly what [`LogoutState::quitting`] is.
//!
//! The 1.12 FrameXML fixes the rest: the CAMP/QUIT dialogs, their 20 s timeouts, and their
//! `PLAYER_CAMPING` / `PLAYER_QUITING` / `LOGOUT_CANCEL` drivers (UIParent.lua l.304-315, event
//! ids 276/277/278 in wow-re's `re/events/event-catalog.tsv`).
