//! The app-side **loot feed** (decision 0084) — the inward half of the loot seam around
//! [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `loot` module, the twin of [`crate::ui_merchant`]'s merchant seam.
//!
//! The net bridge ([`crate::net::apply`]) fills [`LootState`] from the wire: `SMSG_LOOT_RESPONSE` →
//! the rows + coin pile ([`LootState::open`]); `SMSG_LOOT_REMOVED` → that row becomes an empty gap
//! at its fixed position ([`LootState::remove_slot`] — the layout never compacts while open);
//! `SMSG_LOOT_CLEAR_MONEY` → the coin row becomes the same kind of gap
//! ([`LootState::clear_money`]); `SMSG_LOOT_RELEASE_RESPONSE` → the window closes
//! ([`LootState::clear`]); the error shape → [`LootErrors`]; `SMSG_ITEM_PUSH_RESULT` → a queued
//! "You receive loot" line ([`LootState::receives`]). A removal that empties the window arms the
//! client-authoritative **auto-close** ([`LootState::auto_release`] — the real engine's
//! close-on-last-slot), released by [`drain_loot`].
//!
//! Each frame [`feed_loot`] surfaces the errors + receive lines on the red UI error line (the
//! equip-error path's exact shape — an ErrorsFrame-style v1 stopgap that migrates to the chat frame
//! next arc), resolves each wire [`LootItem`] to a Lua-facing [`LootRow`] (icon straight from the
//! wire `display_info_id` through the same `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc` catalog the bags use — no template
//! wait; name + quality via the ask-once item-template cache, `None`/re-fed while in flight),
//! prepends the synthesized coin row when the loot carries gold, pushes the snapshot
//! ([`benilla_ui::script::UiScript::set_loot`]), and fires `LOOT_OPENED` on open / `LOOT_UPDATE` on a
//! content change / `LOOT_CLOSED` on clear. [`drain_loot`] pulls the Lua intents back out: `LootSlot`
//! → coin ? [`ClientCommand::LootMoney`] : [`ClientCommand::AutostoreLootItem`] (the clicked 1-based
//! row mapped to the item's **wire** loot slot); `CloseLoot` → [`ClientCommand::LootRelease`].
