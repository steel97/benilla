//! **Overhead unit names** — the 1.12.1 overhead-name system, three §5 verdicts deep (wow-re
//! `object-layer/scratch/overhead-name.md` + `playername/scratch/name-render-geometry-law.md`,
//! incl. the `ee2ea7af` color/occlusion corrections the director's reference A/B forced):
//!
//! - **World-pass geometry, depth-tested.** The name batch is created depth-test + depth-write ON
//!   (`0x6c7470 → 0x5c1d60(1,1)`; flush `0x5c8b70` → `GxRsSet(GL_DEPTH_TEST, 1)`) and drawn inside
//!   the world/model 3-D pass — **walls occlude names**. (The floating combat text batch is
//!   created `(0,0)`: an overlay, through walls — our combat text stays as-is.) So a name here is
//!   a real **world billboard mesh**: glyph quads in name-local pitch units, camera-facing,
//!   world-scaled — occlusion, the distance shrink, and exact centering all fall out of the world
//!   pass. Named divergence: `AlphaMode::Blend` depth-tests but doesn't depth-write; name-vs-name
//!   overlap resolves by transparent-pass sorting instead — visually equivalent.
//! - **Reaction-colored** (the A/B falsified the earlier "constant white"): the render `0x6c6e90`
//!   fetches `unit->vtable[0x2c]` = `CGUnit::GetSelectionCircleColor 0x605960` — the SAME selector
//!   as the ground selection ring. NPC: dead gray, else reaction red/orange/yellow/green; player:
//!   hostile red, else the `¬X∧¬Y` split — PvP-flagged green (party pale-green), unflagged the
//!   soft blue (party pale-blue). benilla does not re-derive any of that: it calls the ring's own
//!   [`ring_variant`] and paints what it answers, because "the SAME selector" above is the literal
//!   claim (decision 0659 — a hand-copied mirror had drifted and a flagged player wore a green
//!   ring under a blue name). The selector's **first-priority branch** — the combat-flash
//!   red↔orange pulse — is live too: [`CombatFlash`] (recomputed per frame from the selection +
//!   our server-echoed attack bracket, exactly the client's per-frame `[unit+0xc58]` bit 0x10)
//!   overrides the whole palette while we melee this unit.
//! - **Anchor**: the posed PlayerName attachment ([`overhead_anchor`]), re-read **every frame in
//!   lockstep with the mesh pose, no smoothing** (byte-verified: the client memoizes the pose per
//!   model generation; our per-frame joint read matches).
//! - **Scale**: `d = anchor.z − feet.z`, `scale = d > 4 ? (d/4)·1.5·0.2 : 0.2` — unit-HEIGHT
//!   scaling (taller model, bigger name; humanoids all at the 0.2 floor). Pitch : size is 1:1 at
//!   the desc level (verified).
//! - **Seat** (the world-mode vertical law, §5-verified after the director's "names too low"
//!   falsified the first reading): `drawPos.z = anchor.z + lineCount·scale` is the **TOP line's
//!   BASELINE** and the block **hangs DOWN** from it — line `i`'s baseline at
//!   `anchor.z + (lineCount − i)·scale` (`string_layout_lines 0x5cdc20` rotated branch: line 0
//!   seeded at local-Y 0, one pitch subtracted per line; sign pinned by the raid-marker
//!   cross-check). So the whole block sits ABOVE the attachment — never "bottom at the anchor",
//!   which sat every name one line-height too low. Each line's baseline lands on that grid via
//!   the face's own ascent fraction ([`UiFontAtlas::ascent_ratio`], the `[0x17c]` load_param); the
//!   sub-pitch ascent/descent extents inside the top/bottom lines remain the gx-boundary
//!   INFERRED residual (a director A/B pins the exact pixels).
//! - **Show gate** (`ShouldShowName 0x6070a0`): own unit → `UnitNameOwn` (binary default OFF,
//!   checked before the rescue; benilla defaults **ON** — the director's directive — plus a
//!   benilla-side fade gate: the own name hides with the fully-faded first-person avatar, our
//!   reading of the gate's INFERRED `vtable+0x58` can-show leg); the **current TARGET shows
//!   regardless of cvars** — the rescue global `[0xb4e2d8]` is the *selection*, pinned by the
//!   combat-flash RE; the earlier "mouseover" reading of the same global is CORRECTED here; a
//!   **dead creature shows only via the target rescue** (director-verified on the reference; the
//!   byte leg is a flagged pin); players → `UnitNamePlayer` (ON); NPCs → `UnitNameNPC` (binary
//!   default OFF; benilla defaults **ON** — the director's directive; the reference install's
//!   effective default is a flagged open).
//! - **Lines** (`0x608f50`): NPC = name + `<Subname>` (an empty wire subname is no line); player =
//!   [flag prefixes +] name (guild/PVP-title lines wait on data that doesn't stream yet). The
//!   prefixes are the a1–a3 vtable-slot decorations of the line stack (`+0x7c/+0x80/+0x84`),
//!   glued straight onto the name by the `%s%s…` assembly — `<AFK>`/`<DND>`/`<GM>` in that slot
//!   order from `PLAYER_FLAGS` (see [`flag_prefix`]; byte-verified, wow-re Q4a). The trio is
//!   unique to the overhead name binary-wide (`CHAT_FLAG_GM`'s only xref is the a3 slot).
