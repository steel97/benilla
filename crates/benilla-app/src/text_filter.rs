//! The two 1.12 text filters — `profanityFilter`'s **masker** and `spamFilter`'s **predicate**
//! (decision 2077; wow-re `system/ui/scratch/text-filter-law.md`, a §5 round of seven workers with
//! an emulated run of the binary's own compile/exec over the shipped lists).
//!
//! Both are **PCRE over shipped DBCs**, not word lists: `ChatProfanity.dbc` (2289 rows) feeds the
//! masker `0x4a1a60`, `SpamMessages.dbc` (28 gold-seller URL patterns) feeds the predicate
//! `0x4a1ca0`. The reference compiles them once at startup and never reloads.
//!
//! ## The masker (`0x4a1a60`) — in place, length-preserving, phase-carrying
//!
//! It **self-gates**: `[0x843600]` (the `profanityFilter` mirror) is read at `0x4a1a66`, at the head
//! of the transform, which is why all thirteen of its call sites are CVar-gated without any of them
//! testing the CVar. That is reproduced here — [`TextFilter::mask`] takes the switch, and no call
//! site repeats it.
//!
//! Per matched span it overwrites **one byte per byte** from `.rdata 0x806458` = `!@#$%^&*`,
//! advancing a **process-global index `[0xb6e5f0]` that is never reset**. So the mask phase carries
//! across matches, across messages and across subsystems for the whole session — a client that
//! restarts the cycle per message diverges visibly on the second censored word. Patterns apply in
//! **list order, not text order**, every occurrence, and the string's length never changes (a
//! multi-byte match becomes that many ASCII punctuation bytes, exactly as the reference's byte loop
//! does).
//!
//! **Wired here: the chat chokepoint only** — the fourteen social chat types of `.rdata 0x8046d8`,
//! which is the masker's largest consumer and the one the options row is about. The reference has
//! twelve more call sites and they are named rather than quietly skipped: `SMSG_MAIL_LIST_RESULT`'s
//! subject, `GetInboxText`, `GetGuildInfo`, the two guild-record accessors, `SMSG_GUILD_ROSTER`'s
//! MOTD and info buffers, `GetGuildRosterInfo`, `GuildControlGetRankName`, item text before
//! `ITEM_TEXT_READY`, `SendChatMessage`, and `SMSG_GUILD_EVENT`'s MOTD. Each needs the mask applied
//! where that text enters our model rather than at the Lua getter (benilla publishes a model where
//! the reference re-filters a raw store), which is a different piece of plumbing per subsystem.
//!
//! **The `dl = 1` memo lands with them, not before.** Seven of those twelve pass it, and it is
//! observable: a cache hit re-blits the stored text so the mask index does *not* advance, which is
//! what stops a roster string re-read every repaint from shimmering. Masking once as the text
//! enters the model is that same behaviour by construction, so the memo is a thing those sites will
//! need only if they mask at the getter. Shipping the leg now would be a method nothing calls.
//!
//! ## The predicate (`0x4a1ca0`) — a boolean, never an edit
//!
//! One call site image-wide, inside the chat chokepoint. It never touches the subject text; its
//! out-buffer is written and discarded, and its memo cache is dead code in this build. A positive
//! result **drops the line silently** — nothing is shown in its place.
//!
//! ## PCRE → `regex`, exactly
//!
//! Two translations, and both are the reference's own behaviour rather than a convenience:
//!
//! - **`\<` and `\>` are word boundaries, not literals.** Blizzard *patched* PCRE's escape table
//!   (`.rdata 0x812330`) to give `\<`, `\>` and `\b` the identical code `−4`, so both are
//!   non-directional `\b`. Stock PCRE has no `<`/`>` entries and would make them literals, which
//!   would kill the entire ASCII half of `ChatProfanity`. wow-re settled this twice — at the table,
//!   and by running the binary's own compiler on a reversal control (`\>twat\<` behaves exactly
//!   like `\<twat\>`).
//! - **CASELESS folds ASCII only** — the fold table `0x873c40` is the identity over `0x80..=0xff`.
//!   `regex`'s own `(?i)` folds Unicode, which would match `É` where the reference matches nothing,
//!   so instead both the pattern's literals and the subject are ASCII-lowercased and the match runs
//!   case-*sensitively*. ASCII lowercasing never touches a UTF-8 continuation byte, so every match
//!   offset maps back to the original string unchanged.
//!
//! The shipped patterns use only `. < > s` after a backslash and `? [ ] * + ^ $ .` as metacharacters
//! — no backreferences, no lookaround — so `regex` runs them as PCRE would.
