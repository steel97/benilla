//! **Cinematic playback** — the race-intro fly-by, and every other `SMSG_TRIGGER_CINEMATIC`.
//!
//! A cinematic is an in-engine camera flight, not a movie: the trigger carries a
//! `CinematicSequences.dbc` id, the row names its `CinematicCamera.dbc` shots, and each shot is an
//! authored eye/target/roll path in a `Cameras\*.m2` planted at a world origin and facing. The
//! parsing, the world transform and the Bézier evaluation all live in
//! [`benilla_formats::CinematicPath`]; this module is the *playback* — when it starts, what it
//! takes over while it runs, and how it ends.
//!
//! # What the reference does, and what we match
//!
//! Byte-verified in wow-re (the cinematic dispatch, 2026-08-29), and the reason each piece here is
//! shaped the way it is:
//!
//! - **A trigger that arrives before the world is up is deferred, not dropped.** The reference
//!   stashes the sequence id in a single-slot latch (`0xc4d75c`) whenever its world-load gate is
//!   still closed, and starts it the instant the gate opens (`0x5deb78`). Last write wins; there
//!   is no queue. [`Cinematic::pending`] is that latch, and the gate here is the loading screen —
//!   a first login's intro would otherwise play its opening seconds behind the cover, with no UI
//!   to ESC out of.
//! - **The camera path is armed as an ordinary M2 animation** (`0x7121a0`, sequence 0, rate 1.0)
//!   and the shot ends when the scene clock reaches the sequence band's end — `M2Sequence.end −
//!   .start`, which is [`CinematicPath::duration_ms`]. Every shipped fly-by is `flags` bit 0 =
//!   clamp, i.e. plays **once and freezes**; it does not loop. (`Scry_cam`, which is not a race
//!   intro, is the one file authored to loop — a difference we inherit for free by ending on the
//!   band rather than on the flag.)
//! - **Between the shots of a multi-camera row the client sends `CMSG_NEXT_CINEMATIC_CAMERA`**
//!   (`0x48efe0`), and a camera id of `0` **ends** the cinematic rather than being skipped. No
//!   shipped row has a second camera, so this path is exercised only by a server with its own
//!   DBCs — which is exactly why it is written rather than assumed away.
//! - **ESC is not an engine binding.** `StopCinematic` has zero native callers in the reference:
//!   the only skip path is `CinematicFrame.xml`'s own `OnKeyDown`, which is why benilla's copy of
//!   that frame (`assets/ui/CinematicFrame.xml`) carries the same handler and why the Lua binding
//!   queues [`SessionRequest::StopCinematic`](benilla_ui::script::SessionRequest) rather than
//!   reaching in here.
//! - **The ack ends the run, once.** `CMSG_COMPLETE_CINEMATIC` goes out on a natural end and on an
//!   ESC skip alike (`0x48f080`). Decision 0196 is why it can never be dropped: unacked, vmangos
//!   re-anchors object visibility to its own copy of the flying camera and everything around the
//!   body despawns until relog.
//!
//! # What we deliberately do differently
//!
//! The reference defers both the start and the stop by **0.25 s** through a scheduled fade
//! (`0x4c0d10`, the constant at `[0x804550]`). benilla plays the shot immediately and acks
//! immediately: the fade is a transition effect we have not built, and faking its *delay* without
//! its *picture* would only add latency. Noted rather than silently dropped — it is the one timing
//! difference from the reference on this path.
//!
//! # What playback takes over
//!
//! Three things, all released on the way out. The **camera** (this module writes the
//! [`WorldCamera`] pose and FOV after `control` has seated it, the same slot
//! `apply_camera_shake` uses); the **streaming focus**, which has to follow the camera rather than
//! the body, because a Tauren's shot opens 1741 yards from where the body stands and would
//! otherwise fly over unstreamed terrain; and the **UI's cinematic flag**, which drives
//! `CinematicFrame`'s letterbox and makes `InCinematic()` answer truthfully so `StaticPopup`
//! suppresses dialogs the way the reference's does.
