//! The weapon **swing trail** — `SpellVisualKit` CharProc type **8**, the ribbon a melee ability
//! smears behind its blade (wow-re `charproc8-weapon-trail.md`, §5-verified end to end).
//!
//! For **16 of the 27 trail kits a live spell reaches, this is the entire visual**: kit 324
//! (Heroic Strike / Overpower / Mortal Strike / Bloodthirst / Rend — 218 spells), 506
//! (Revenge / Riposte / Mongoose Bite), 557 (Sunder Armor), 646 (Hamstring / Wing Clip), 399
//! (Sinister Strike), 822 (Garrote), 823 (Feint / Disengage) name no emitter slot at all, so
//! without this module those abilities render nothing beyond the swing animation.
//!
//! ## The mechanism
//!
//! The proc does not draw. It **latches two words on the unit** and the unit's *next* animation
//! fires them:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x60d80a  the type-8 dispatcher arm      unit+0xd1c = ftol(ParamZero) | (ftol(ParamThree) << 24)
//!                                          unit+0xd20 = ftol(ParamTwo)          -- ms
//! 0x5fe48e  CGUnit::PlayAnimation, the      if (unit+0xd20 != 0) 0x60e550(&colour, duration)
//!           fields' ONLY reader             unit+0xd20 = 0                       -- one-shot
//! 0x60e550  fan out to CGUnit+0xd34[0..1]   one WTOBJECT per weapon hand
//! 0x6c6750  arm a SWING on that object      re-arming a live one RESETS its ring, never stacks
//! 0x6c67f0  the weapon model's per-frame cb sample $WTB/$WTT -> 0x6c6560
//! 0x6c6560  append / fade / draw / die      the arithmetic transcribed in [`Swing::step`]
//! ```
//!
//! [`WeaponTrail`] is the WTOBJECT: one per spawned weapon prop whose model authors both markers,
//! carrying the reference's nullable `SWING` as [`Swing`]. The prop's own despawn (a weapon swap,
//! a shapeshift) is the teardown, exactly as `0x6c6970` frees the object with the model reference
//! it holds.
//!
//! ## The light term — ambient only, and no `N·L` half
//!
//! The callback turns lighting **on** (EGxRs `0x0e = 1` at `0x6c6847`) over a vertex format that
//! carries **no normal** (format 7 is position + colour, stride 16). That combination is not a
//! contradiction and it is not a no-op — it selects a specific, reduced term, derived at the bytes
//! in wow-re `format7-lighting-term.md`:
//!
//! ```text
//! out = (Σ enabled lights' Ambient) × authoredColour  +  inherited material Emissive
//! ```
//!
//! - The vertex colour **is** the material: `0x5a1e30` sets both `DIFFUSEMATERIALSOURCE` and
//!   `AMBIENTMATERIALSOURCE` to `D3DMCS_COLOR1` off the format's diffuse bit, which format 7 has.
//! - The normal is **explicitly disabled**, not stale: `0x592a60` replaces the format mask rather
//!   than OR-ing it, and `0x59c100` issues `glDisableClientState(GL_NORMAL_ARRAY)` when the bit is
//!   clear (D3D's format-7 descriptor carries `−1` in the normal column). So there is no `N·L` to
//!   compute and the **diffuse half contributes nothing** — which is why this does not simply take
//!   [`benilla_world::particles::buffer::EffectLighting::Scene`], whose term is
//!   `clamp(ambient + diffuse·max(N·L, 0))` against the world up axis. Applying that here would
//!   add a sun term the reference does not have.
//! - The global `D3DRS_AMBIENT` (EGxRs id 6) has **zero writers image-wide** and defaults to 0, so
//!   the whole ambient contribution comes from the M2 lighting collector's own enabled lights —
//!   the same lights our lit emitters take their `ambient` from.
//!
//! So the trail **darkens with the scene** rather than burning at its authored colour — and the
//! scene it darkens with is its **wearer's**, not the world's. The draw runs inside the weapon
//! model's own per-frame callback during the wearer's model draw, so the enabled lights it
//! inherits are the ones the M2 collector committed for that unit; the held weapon's light node is
//! the wearer's own by aliasing (`[item+0x3b8] = [wearer+0x3b8]`, `0x718960`). Both halves are
//! four-way byte-derived (wow-re `format7-lighting-term.md`, `part-lit-normal-space.md` §6):
//!
//! - **outdoors** a unit's committed ambient IS the day/night ambient, so
//!   [`benilla_world::lighting::WowLighting`] is exact, not an approximation;
//! - **indoors** it is the light node's own ramped word, chasing `cap96(MOCV)` — the room's light,
//!   never the sky's ([`benilla_world::interior::NodeAmbient`], the ambient half of the same
//!   committed words [`benilla_world::interior::ParticleLight`] folds whole). Its absence is the
//!   exterior lane, which is why the fallback above is the right one and not a guess.
//!
//! One named approximation is left: the **emissive** term is not modelled. It is inherited
//! material state whose value that round did not pin, and `EMISSIVEMATERIALSOURCE` is set nowhere,
//! so it is a constant we would be inventing rather than reproducing.
//!
//! The fold happens on the CPU, into the vertex colours, and the draw declares
//! [`benilla_world::particles::buffer::EffectLighting::None`] — the ambient is a per-draw constant,
//! and per-draw constants belong in the vertex stream on a lane whose whole design is one shared
//! buffer of them (the effect lane's own rule; it is what the `Committed` variant exists for).
//!
//! ## What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! - **No transport ride-frame.** A committed sample is stored in absolute world coordinates and
//!   never re-projected. `0x6c67f0` takes `0x7131b0`'s world position straight into the ring and
//!   neither it nor `0x6c6560` reads `[CM2Model+0x17c]` — unlike the particle and ribbon lanes,
//!   whose birth sites (`0x7b5160`, `0x7b7bc0`) do (`crate` `benilla_world::ride_frame`, 1591).
//!   A swing on a moving deck smears in the reference too; that is the mechanism, not a gap.
//! - **No sheath gate, and no handedness test.** `0x608d60` resolves the weapon's attachment
//!   through `0x47a070(SheatheType, isMainHand)` and hangs the object wherever the weapon
//!   currently sits, so a stowed weapon is still trail-capable; and neither of `[vtbl+0x98]`'s two
//!   bodies (`0x5ec240` for a player, `0x605e30` for a creature) contains an InventoryType or
//!   handedness test. A two-hander gets one trail only because the server leaves the off-hand slot
//!   empty — which is exactly what our own off-hand slot does. **Creatures get trails too**, off
//!   `UNIT_VIRTUAL_ITEM_SLOT_DISPLAY`; this is not a player-only effect.
