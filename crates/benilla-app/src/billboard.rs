//! M2 billboard cards — submeshes that ride a billboard bone (glow cards, chains, the questgiver
//! markers). The real 1.12 client re-orients the bone to the camera every frame; benilla otherwise
//! renders M2 geometry in its static bind pose, single-sided.
//!
//! **The re-orientation law is byte-pinned** (wow-re `animation/scratch/billboard-bone-law.md`,
//! §5): the M2 bone palette is computed in **VIEW space**, and a billboard bone's matrix rows are
//! REPLACED with the camera basis — spherical (`0x08`) takes the whole fixed basis (bone X toward
//! the viewer, Y screen-right, Z screen-up: the identity rows `{(0,0,−1),(1,0,0),(0,1,0)}` at
//! `0x714463`); the lock arms (`0x10`/`0x20`/`0x40` = keep X/Y/Z) keep their authored axis and
//! rebuild the other two from the camera (`0x40` lock-Z — the `?` marker's `0x240` — keeps model
//! up, rebuild the in-plane pair). Crucially this is the **view-matrix basis, one shared
//! orientation for every billboard** — NOT a per-pivot aim, and NOT the geometry's facet normal
//! (the old card aimed its first-triangle normal at the camera: arbitrary for 3-D geometry like
//! the 353-vert `?`, which is exactly why its proportions read wrong). The lock-Z in-plane sign
//! is `Y = Fwd × Z` — the 0168 handedness residual, settled by the director's A/B (the recorded
//! `Z × Fwd` order turned the model 180°: a mirrored `?`); it makes lock-Z agree with the
//! spherical arm's toward-the-viewer X at a level camera.
//!
//! The submesh mesh is built **centred at its bone pivot** (`benilla_assets::build_submesh_mesh`)
//! in the model-local Bevy frame — where the WoW bone axes land as X→−Z, Y→−X, Z→+Y (coords.rs) —
//! so we place the entity at the pivot's world position and write the rebuilt basis as its
//! rotation each frame; the geometry itself is never touched.
