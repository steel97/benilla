//! **Realm selection** — the glue screen between the login and character select, and the policy
//! that decides whether the player ever sees it.
//!
//! For the project's whole life the client took `logon.realms.first()`: whichever realm the auth
//! server happened to list first was the realm you played on, the reference's `Change Realm` button
//! was drawn deliberately disabled, and the character screen's realm banner had nothing to show
//! until the character list arrived carrying the realm as a passenger — which is why it read
//! `Connecting…`, a string the real client does not have. The banner was the symptom; this module
//! is the missing subsystem.
//!
//! **Not to be confused with [`crate::realmlist`]**, which is the *address of the logon server* —
//! the reference's `realmList` CVar and its `realmlist.wtf`. The collision is the reference's own
//! (`realmList` the CVar, `RealmList` the window) and is kept rather than invented away: one is
//! where you dial, this is what answers.
//!
//! ## Not a screen — a dialog
//!
//! `RealmList` is **not** one of the glue screens. `GlueParent.lua`'s `GlueScreenInfo` table has
//! entries for `login`, `charselect`, `realmwizard`, `charcreate`, `patchdownload`, `movie` and
//! `credits` — and none for the realm list; `RealmList.xml` declares a `frameStrata="DIALOG"`
//! frame that `RealmList_OnEvent` simply `Show()`s, and `RealmList_OnCancel` simply `Hide()`s.
//! Whatever screen it went up over is still there underneath and is what the player is returned to.
//!
//! This shipped as a `ClientState` instead, and every symptom the director reported came out of
//! that one error: Cancel had to pick a state to go to (it picked the login screen, so Change
//! Realm's Cancel threw you out of the session), the character screen was torn down behind it, and
//! — the bad one — a roster arriving while that state was up moved nothing, so Okay looked inert
//! while the IO thread walked on to the character park. The next Cancel then sent an answer no
//! park was listening for and every later login queued behind a thread two parks away: the client
//! hung on "Connecting" with nothing in the log. It is a `shown` flag now, like the AddOns panel
//! it shares a plate with, and the screen underneath is never touched.
//!
//! ## The parks
//!
//! The IO thread publishes the list from **two** parks (`crate::net::io`) and takes its answer on
//! one channel: the *login-side* realm park (logon → **which realm?** → world handshake), and the
//! *character* park, where Change Realm raises the same list over the select screen and the
//! session underneath stays live. At each park the thread publishes facts and blocks; the app owns
//! the policy. Here the policy is:
//!
//! 1. **`WOW_REALM`**, when set — the dev fast path past the screen, the realm-side twin of
//!    `WOW_CHAR`. Matched case-insensitively; a name that is not on the list falls through rather
//!    than failing, so a stale env var cannot strand a session.
//! 2. **The realm this session is on** — a logout or a dropped connection comes back through this
//!    park, and the answer is the realm you were already playing on, not a question.
//! 3. **The remembered realm** — the `realmName` CVar, which 1.12 registers as a *persisted* CVar
//!    for exactly this ("last realm connected to"). A launch that recognises its realm goes
//!    straight to character select, and `Change Realm` is how you get back here.
//! 4. **An unattended run takes the first realm that is up** — `crate::run_mode::unattended`
//!    (`WOW_UNATTENDED`/`WOW_CAPTURE`/`WOW_RIG`). A smoke run, a capture and a rig leg have nobody
//!    in the room to click OK, and a screen that waits forever is how a park becomes a hang. This
//!    is deliberately `unattended` and not `env_login` — 1769's distinction: credentials in the
//!    environment do not mean nobody is watching, but these three cannot be a person.
//! 5. **Otherwise the dialog**, and the player picks.
//!
//! ## Change Realm
//!
//! Costs a world dial, not a login. The SRP6 session key authenticates against any world server on
//! the account's realm list and the list itself is already in hand, so the character park serves
//! the list **in place** — refreshing it on the realmd connection the cycle still holds — and only
//! leaves when a realm is chosen. Cancel there does nothing at all, which is what makes it Cancel.
//!
//! That is the reference's shape, byte for byte (VERIFIED, wow-re):
//! `CharacterSelect_ChangeRealm()` is `PlaySound + RequestRealmList(1)` and **names no screen**;
//! `RequestRealmList` (`0x46ecf0` → `0x46b8d0`) sets `screenState = 4` and begins a
//! `COP_GET_REALMS` on the realmd socket that is still open (it is closed at *world entry*,
//! `0x46b70c`, not on the way to character select); and the world connection is **not** dropped by
//! the button — only `ConnectToRealm` (`0x46b210`) drops it, once a realm is confirmed, deferring
//! its dial to the disconnect handler. So the whole cost of opening the list is a list request,
//! and the whole cost of cancelling is nothing.
