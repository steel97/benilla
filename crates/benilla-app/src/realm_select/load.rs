//! **The realm list's two computed columns** — the load band and the realm type — and the row
//! colours that go with them.
//!
//! The load word a player reads (`Low` / `Medium` / `High` / `Full` / `New` / `Recommended`) is
//! *not* the population the auth server sent. It is a **band**: the client takes the populations of
//! **every realm it knows** — all categories, not the selected tab — computes their mean and a
//! scaled standard deviation, and places each realm's population in that distribution. So the same realm reads `High` on a quiet
//! list and `Low` on a busy one. Anything that printed the raw float would be showing a different
//! word from the real client on every list.
//!
//! **A one-realm list is not a special case that reads `Medium`** — a tempting thing to assume, and
//! wrong. The reference short-circuits `n <= 1` to `(mean = 1.0, stddev = 0.0)`, which is a real
//! distribution of zero width, so the single realm is banded against the literal 1.0: below it
//! reads `Low`, above it reads `High`, and only an exact 1.0 reads `Medium`. Our own vmangos realm
//! advertises 0.06 and therefore reads **Low**, which is what the real client would show too.
//!
//! [`realm_load_stats`] and [`realm_load_classify`] are ports of wow-re's byte-exact
//! `crates/glue/src/realm.rs` (`CGlue::RealmLoadStats` `0x46e510` and `CGlue::RealmLoadClassify`
//! `0x46ec60`), including their x87 rounding behaviour — the accumulators round to `f32` every
//! iteration because the binary stores them to `f32` slots inside the loop, while the mean, the
//! sqrt and the band comparisons stay 53-bit. Kept faithful rather than tidied because the band
//! edges are exactly where a rounding difference would flip a visible word.
//!
//! The band → string → colour mapping is the reference `GlueXML/RealmList.lua`'s
//! `RealmListUpdate`, read literally.
