//! **The realm-list boundary smoke** (`WOW_REALM_SMOKE=1`, run by `scripts/smoke.sh`) — the
//! scripted walk that reproduces the failure this subsystem shipped with, so it can never come
//! back silently.
//!
//! What broke, and why nothing caught it: the realm list was a `ClientState`, and the roster that
//! arrives after Okay only moved the app off `Login`. So Okay published the pick, the IO thread
//! entered the realm and walked on to the character park — and the app sat on the realm screen,
//! looking exactly as if the button had done nothing. The next Cancel then sent its answer to a
//! park two ahead of the thread, where nobody was listening, and every later login queued behind
//! it: the client hung on "Connecting" with **nothing in the log**. Three screens' worth of
//! symptoms, one missing transition, and no test in the workspace could see any of it, because
//! every one of them models the app or the thread and the bug lived in the seam.
//!
//! So this leg drives the seam, against a real server:
//!
//! 1. from character select, **Change Realm** — the dialog goes up *over* the screen, which stays;
//! 2. **Okay** on the realm we are already on — a real world re-dial, and the roster has to come
//!    back with the dialog down and the screen still character select (the leg that was broken);
//! 3. **Change Realm again, then Cancel** — the dialog goes down and the session underneath is
//!    untouched, which is the whole of `RealmList_OnCancel`;
//! 4. one more round trip through the park to prove the thread is still where the app thinks it
//!    is: a second Okay that has to land.
//!
//! Inert without the env.
