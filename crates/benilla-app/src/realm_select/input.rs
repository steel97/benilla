//! The realm list's input — the reference's `RealmSelectButton_OnClick`/`OnDoubleClick`,
//! `RealmList_OnOk`/`OnCancel`, `RealmListTab_OnClick`, `SortRealms`, and `RealmList_OnKeyDown`.
//!
//! **Every exit hides the dialog and touches nothing else.** `RealmList_OnOk` is
//! `PlaySound; RealmList:Hide(); ChangeRealm(...)` and `RealmList_OnCancel` is
//! `PlaySound; RealmList:Hide(); RealmListDialogCancelled()` — neither names a screen, because the
//! screen it is standing on is the one the player goes back to (see [`super`]).
