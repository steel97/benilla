//! **The game's WGSL, compiled into the binary** (decision 1175).
//!
//! The five shaders under `src/shaders/` draw the *game's* own surface — the UI quad lane, the
//! glue screen's additive pass, and the three gamma passes. 1171 moved them out of the engine's
//! asset root and into this crate; 1175 stops serving them from a directory at all.
//!
//! They used to reach the asset server through a `game://` source registered with
//! `concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/assets")` — the build machine's source tree, baked into
//! the binary. `embedded_asset!` keeps 1171's line (it is per-crate by construction) and drops the
//! path: the interface cannot go missing because there is nothing to miss.
//!
//! The registration lives here, at the root of `src/`, for the path-arithmetic reason spelled out
//! in `benilla_world::shaders` — the macro does not normalize, so a call from a submodule would
//! bake that submodule's directory into the served path.
