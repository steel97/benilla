///    0-charge copy greys at `4e50ab`. Both are count-scope work, not this arm's.
/// 2. **`IsItemOnCooldown 0x6e2fc0`** (`4e50d0`) ⇒ `(false, false)`. It resolves the item's FIRST
///    ON_USE block — `rec+0x11c[i] > 0 && rec+0x130[i] == 0`, `6e3006`–`6e3023`, the same scan
///    behind [`benilla_protocol::messages::ItemInfo::use_spell`] — and asks

///    NOT a general on-cooldown one (wow-re `spell/scratch/gcd-power-gate.md` §3, which corrects
///    `wave-cooldown.md`'s published gloss): it reads neither a running timed cooldown nor the
///    GCD. So a potion mid-cooldown keeps its colour under its own sweep, and nothing on the bar
///    greys for the global cooldown. **The entry is the key**, not `0`: `0x6e2fc0` is the sole
///    consumer of `0x6e1690`'s item-keyed form image-wide (`6e3037 push esi`), every other caller
///    passing `0` — so querying leg 11's `(spell, 0)` form here would never find an item's own
///    parked record, which is how our cooldown store keys it (`(use_spell, entry)`).
/// 3. **the plain-spell walk.** The resolver `0x4e5a50`'s ITEM arm hands that same first ON_USE
///    spell back with `*outType = 0` **hard-written** (wow-re `action-button-state-api.md` §0), so

///    is not a food rule: 453 of the shipped rows carry that bit (bandages, mounts, disguises).
