//! The **world** click's two commits — the two legs of the reference's click dispatcher
//! `0x492ce0`, which while targeting are chosen by the *pending spell's word*, not by the scene
//! (wow-re `world-click-targeting.md` §2: the pick flags `0x481050` builds come only from
//! `0xcecac0` when `IsTargeting`).
//!
//! - **terrain leg** (`0x492c90` → `0x492580` → `BindLocation 0x6e60f0`) — [`commit_ground_cast_on_click`]
//! - **object leg** (`0x492ce0` → `SELECT 0x4925d0` → `SetSelection 0x493540` @ `4935d5` →
//!   `BindTarget 0x6e5b40`) — [`commit_object_cast_on_click`]
//!
//! They cannot both fire for one word, and not because we sequence them: the predicates are
//! disjoint on real data (`& 0x60` vs `& 0x4800`), and in the reference the *pick* enforces it —
//! a location-only word yields pick flags `3`, whose `& 0x7c == 0` disables the object pick
//! entirely, which is why an AoE reticle clicks straight through a chest.
//!
//! Neither leg gates on range, validity or the lock. `0x492580`'s complete callee set contains no
//! range call and no error emitter, and the object leg's `BindTarget` arm reads nothing but the
//! clicked object's typemask and the word (wow-re C2 REFUTED). The server judges; its refusing
//! `SMSG_CAST_RESULT` is the red line.
