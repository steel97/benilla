//! **The targeting cursor** — the client's one "this cast is waiting for a click" machine, and the
//! three seams that can end it: the **terrain** click (decision 0792, closing B132:
//! "ground-targeted AOE all Invalid target"), the **bag / paper-doll** click (decision 0923:
//! poisons, stones, oils, scopes, enchants; 0928: its lockbox word and the two confirm popups), and
//! the **world GameObject** click (decision 0939: Opening / Pick Lock / Mining / Herb Gathering
//! armed from the book or a bar, then clicked at a chest, door or node).
//!
//! The reference's targeting mode IS a nonzero flag_word (`IsTargeting 0x6e48a0`), and that word —
//! not a verdict about it — is what this module holds ([`SpellTargeting`]). Each seam asks it the
//! seam's own one-instruction question ([`TargetingWants`]), which is why a lock spell can arm the
//! bag click and the world click at once.
//!
//! This file is the **state and the input plumbing**; the three seams and the cursor live beside
//! it, each transcribing a byte-verified piece (wow-re `wave-cast.md` + `cursor-system.md` §5 +
//! `world-click-targeting.md`, plus 0923's own read of the two pickup seams):
//!
//! - [`cursor`] — while targeting, the world classifier is pre-empted (the ref's dispatcher step 2
//!   runs before any object resolve), and the verdict is **per-seam** (decision 0949): the pick
//!   flags come from the word, so the word chooses the handler — terrain → `0x4820f0`'s
//!   `CheckGroundPointInRange 0x6e6810`, a GameObject → `0x4828d0`'s `0x6e6460` (the word's
//!   `& 0x4800`, the spell-vs-lock predicate `0x5f8260`, then the range test), and **no handler
//!   at all → UnableCast**. That default is what greys an armed lockpick over open ground and
//!   greys a poison everywhere in the world. Also the reticle's radius ([`ground_cast_radius`]).
//! - [`world`] — the two legs of the world-click dispatcher `0x492ce0`: the **terrain** leg's
//!   ground commit (`0x492580` → `BindLocation 0x6e60f0`) and the **object** leg's GameObject bind
//!   (`0x4925d0` → `SetSelection 0x493540` @ `4935d5` → `BindTarget 0x6e5b40`'s GO arm). Which leg
//!   a click can even take is a function of the pending spell's word, not of the scene.
//! - [`item`] — the bag click (`PickupContainerItem 0x4f9b30` @ `4f9c54`) and the paper-doll click
//!   (`0x4c7300` @ `4c76df`) each carry the same three-instruction rung — IsTargeting,
//!   `TargetingWantsItem 0x6e6330`, then `0x495d60(itemGuid)` and return — and `0x495d60` is
//!   [`item_bind_verdict`] plus the bind. Two of its four exits are the **confirm popups**
//!   (`BIND_ENCHANT` / `REPLACE_ENCHANT`, decision 0928), which park the clicked guid
//!   ([`EnchantConfirmItem`], the ref's `0xb4e3c0`) and return with the word still standing; their
//!   Yes re-enters that same drain.
//!
//! All three end in **one commit tail** ([`crate::ui_action::CastLadder::commit_targeted`]): the
//! packet (`SendCast 0x6e54f0`'s same block, two opcodes), the pending arm, the GCD, and the word
//! cleared.
//!
//! **The ESC chain** ([`feed_targeting_to_vm`] / [`drain_stop_targeting`]): the real
//! `UIParent.lua:1490` rung (`elseif ( SpellStopTargeting() ) then`) runs in our live VM; the feed
//! pushes the state its `SpellIsTargeting`/`SpellStopTargeting` bindings read (and the item seam's
//! arm, which gates the VM's click reroute), the drain commits the cancel. AbortCast in targeting
//! mode clears the word and sends **nothing**.
//!
//! Entry and the two press-cancel shapes live in the cast path itself: the resolver yields
//! [`crate::ui_action::cast_target::CastWireTarget::Targeting`] carrying the word, the one
//! cast-send path enters the mode here, a NEW spell's press aborts-and-proceeds (`TryCast
//! 6e4d62`), and the action bar's re-press of the SAME spell toggles the mode off (`UseAction
//! 0x4e5ee0`'s `GetTargetingSpellId`+`StopTargeting` — [`crate::ui_action::drain`]).
//!
//! The click path is byte-pinned by wow-re's `world-click-targeting.md`: the terrain-leg commit
//! `0x492580` has **no range gate and no error path** — it binds and sends regardless, and the
//! server judges range (`CheckGroundPointInRange 0x6e6810` has exactly ONE caller binary-wide, the
//! hover classifier `0x4820f0`: its verdict colours the cursor and nothing else). The object leg
//! has no gate either. While targeting, the pick flags come from the pending spell's mask alone —
//! for a dest-only word a unit is not pickable, so a click over one commits on the ground behind it
//! ([`crate::target::click::select_on_click`]'s gate transcribes the unreachable select).
//! Right-click cancels on the DOWN edge ([`cancel_targeting_on_right_press`]); movement never
//! cancels (`0x515090`'s explicit IsTargeting-skip). The ground reticle draws in [`crate::target`]'s
//! `reticle` module (decision 0797) off [`ground_cast_radius`] + the cursor's range verdict — for
//! the **terrain seam alone**, through [`SpellTargeting::spell_for`] (decision 0943): it is a
//! per-seam surface, and reading the seam-agnostic [`SpellTargeting::spell`] there is what put a
//! green AoE circle under every armed lockpick and enchant.
