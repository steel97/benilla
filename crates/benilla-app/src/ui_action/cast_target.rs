//! The cast-arm's **target resolution** — what actually goes in `CMSG_CAST_SPELL`'s target block.
//!
//! Transcribes `Spell_C::ArmCast 0x6e5250` + `BindTarget 0x6e5b40` (wow-re `wave-cast.md`, both
//! byte-verified): the client seeds a targeting flag_word from `Spell.dbc Targets` (`SpellRec+0x34`),
//! adjusts it with the implicit-target switch (`SpellRec+0x148`, jump-table `0x6e5484`), and then
//!
//! - **flag_word == 0** ⇒ the cast needs no target at all — commit immediately, wire mask
//!   `TARGET_FLAG_SELF (0)`, nothing follows (Ice Armor, Battle Shout, Feign Death…). The server
//!   fills the target from the spell's implicit targeting. The real client **never** ships the
//!   current selection for these — doing so is exactly the "Invalid target" bug this fixes.
//! - **nonzero** ⇒ a target is required: the binder satisfies each bit against the candidate with
//!   the matching object-layer relation (assist `0x6066f0` / attack `0x606980` / corpse `0x6067d0`),
//!   binds the guid and clears the bit; only a fully-cleared word commits (wire mask
//!   `TARGET_FLAG_UNIT (0x2)` + the bound guid).
//! - **`Attributes & 0x200`** ⇒ the candidate is not the selection at all but the caster's
//!   **equipped main hand** (`6e5361`–`6e5391`): the client picks the weapon itself and binds it
//!   as an ITEM target, so a shaman's Rockbiter / Flametongue / Frostbrand / Windfury Weapon —
//!   22 rows, four names, the whole 5875 family — casts straight onto the weapon with no cursor
//!   and no click (decision 1552). With the hand **empty** there is still no cursor: TryCast
//!   tests the same bit again on ArmCast's FALSE return (`6e504b`), clears the word and says
//!   *"Your weapon hand is empty"* (decision 1554).
//! - a candidate that satisfies nothing falls back to the **active player** — gated on the
//!   `autoSelfCast` CVar (name `0x870dc0`, gate `[0xceac34]+0x28` at `0x6e53d7`; registered with
//!   engine default `"0"`). The classic "buffing with an enemy targeted casts on yourself".
//! - still unbound ⇒ the ref leaves the nonzero flag_word standing, which *is* its targeting-cursor
//!   mode (`SpellIsTargeting 0x6e48a0` = word != 0 — the hand cursor, click to bind). That machine
//!   is unmodeled here (INTERIM): we refuse locally with the client's own error strings instead —
//!   `0x09` "You have no target." / `0x0A` "Invalid target" — and never ship an unbindable cast.
//!
//! **All three seams of the targeting cursor are modeled** — and the cursor carries the *word*
//! ([`CastWireTarget::Targeting`]), not a verdict about it, because the reference's three "wants"
//! predicates are three independent mask tests on the one word `0xcecac0` and **more than one can
//! be true at once**: `TargetingWantsLocation 0x6e6320` (`& 0x60`) → the terrain click (decision
//! 0792); `TargetingWantsItem 0x6e6330` (`& 0x4010`) → the bag / paper-doll click (0923/0928);
//! `TargetingWantsGameObject 0x6e62d0` (`ch & 0x48`, i.e. `& 0x4800`) → the world click on a
//! GameObject (decision 0939). A LOCKED spell — Opening, Pick Lock, Mining, Herb Gathering —
//! satisfies the last **two**, and the click decides which leg it was, exactly as `BindTarget
//! 0x6e5b40` decides: by the clicked object's typemask (`6e5f17` item bit 1, `6e5f52` GameObject
//! bit 5), each arm then re-testing the word. Still deferred, refused-not-guessed: the pure SOURCE
//! word (0x20 — NPC-cast data only), STRING bit 13, and the *unit* hand-cursor mode (the
//! residual-unit-word machine behind the autoSelfCast stand-in above).
