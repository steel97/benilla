//! **A bar slot never holds a rank the character has outgrown** (decision 0883) — the one place
//! that keeps the action bar's spell ids in step with the spell book's ranks.
//!
//! The bar is client-authoritative (decision 0218 §4): the server stores 120 packed words and
//! hands them back at login, and nothing on the server side ever rewrites them when a rank is
//! learned (VERIFIED vmangos — `Player::AddSpell`'s supersede path touches only the spell store;
//! the only `ConvertSpell` that walks `character_action` is the race-change tool). So the stored
//! bar drifts, and it drifts *silently*: a superseded rank is dropped from the book
//! (`Player::SendInitialSpells` skips `!active` spells), so the button comes back pointing at a
//! spell the character no longer knows — dead, with no way to tell from the icon, which is the
//! same art on every rank. That is the reported bug: a level-60 rogue's saved slot 1 still held
//! Sinister Strike **rank 1** (`character_action.action = 1752`) while the book held only rank 8
//! (11294), so the button did nothing.
//!
//! The chain lives in `SkillLineAbility.dbc`'s `forward_spellid` — 406 of the build's 4753 spells
//! carry it, and they are exactly the abilities the server supersedes (every
//! `SMSG_SUPERCEDED_SPELL` vmangos sends is gated on `GetSpellBookSuccessorSpellId`, which reads
//! that column). Warrior/rogue physical abilities and the profession tier openers are chained;
//! caster nukes and heals are not — their lower ranks stay known and castable, which is what
//! makes vanilla down-ranking work. Normalization therefore cannot touch a deliberate down-rank:
//! it only ever moves within a chain, and a chain is precisely a family where only one rank is
//! ever known at a time.
//!
//! This runs on the `dirty` flag — every book arrival, rank-up and local slot write — so it is
//! ONE mechanism covering all of them, not a login special case. Hence
//! [`super::spells::superceded_spell`] no longer re-points buttons itself: the server's
//! `SMSG_SUPERCEDED_SPELL` moves the *book*, and the bar follows from here. It has to be that way
//! round, because the case that bit us got no supersede packet at all (vmangos suppresses them
//! while the character is loading, so ranks gained offline — a `.levelup`, a boost — arrive as a
//! book that silently disagrees with the bar).
