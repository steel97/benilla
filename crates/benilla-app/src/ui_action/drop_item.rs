//! **`DropItemOnUnit 0x48d960`** — the cursor's held item dropped onto a unit, which in 1.12 is
//! how you feed your pet (decision 1055; wow-re `ui/scratch/item-target-cursor-and-dropitemonunit.md`,
//! VERIFIED).
//!
//! The reference's binding forks on which unit it was given:
//!
//! - **PET** — the unit guid equals `[0xb714a0]/[0xb714a4]`, the charm-else-summon pet global →
//!   `0x6ea1e0`, the validator whose three gates are transcribed in [`feedable_pet`] → `CastSpell`
//!   with the learned Feed Pet spell and **`castItem = NULL`**, then `BindTarget(the food)`.
//! - **PLAYER** — a trade (`CMSG_INITIATE_TRADE 0x116` via `0x5d3fb0`, else a trade-slot
//!   placement). Not modelled here: the trade window owns it, and no node does yet. A drop on a
//!   player is silently refused, which is the same shape every other refusal on this path takes.
//!
//! **The wire is `CMSG_CAST_SPELL (0x12E)`, not `CMSG_USE_ITEM`,** and that falls out of the null
//! cast item: the sender's discriminator (`0x6e5513..0x6e55a7`) takes its no-item arm
//! (`je 0x6e5808`), skipping the `push 0xab` block outright. The block that goes out is
//! `{ spellId, flags = TARGET_FLAG_ITEM (0x0010), the FOOD's guid }` — **the pet's guid never
//! reaches the wire at all**, which is why this is [`TargetedBind::Item`] and not a unit bind.
//!
//! Two behaviours worth stating because they are easy to get backwards:
//!
//! - **`ClearCursor 0x495190(1,1)` runs on SUCCESS only.** Every refusal is silent and leaves the
//!   payload on the cursor — no error line, no drop. So a mis-drop costs nothing and you are still
//!   holding the food.
//! - **There is no range test on this path.** Neither function contains a floating-point
//!   instruction, and the one reachable range helper sits behind a `test [0xceac5c],0x8202` mask
//!   disjoint from `0x0010`. The server judges distance.
