//! Loading screen — the faithful full-screen world-load splash + progress bar shown on initial
//! world entry and on cross-map teleport (the load latency async streaming can't hide). Built on the
//! VERIFIED reference mechanism: per-map art via the
//! `Map.dbc` → `LoadingScreens.dbc` → BLP FK chain (resolved by `benilla-formats`), under the engine's
//! bar — which in 1.12 is exactly two layers, `Loading-BarBorder` + `Loading-BarFill`, at the
//! screen-fraction rects byte-verified from `LoadingScreen.cpp` (NOT the 5-texture stack the asset
//! names suggest; Background/Glow/Glass are never composited in vanilla).
//!
//! **Foundation, not a one-off.** The art lookup is the *same* mechanism for every map kind (open
//! world / instance / battleground) — only the BLP row differs — so this hosts all of them for free.
//! The two cases out of current scope (taxi/boat/zeppelin's moving flight-path icon; a richer
//! progress model) slot in as an extra overlay layer / a different progress source without restructure.
//!
//! **The lifecycle is event-raised, readiness-cleared (decision 0737)** — and the reference's is
//! too, which 0737 assumed it was not. This header claimed for months that the reference *blocks*
//! on its world load and so covers "by construction"; the wow-re round behind decision 1990 says
//! half of that is wrong. The reference runs ordinary frames with **one** blocking stretch inside
//! them (`SMSG_NEW_WORLD`'s `0x401b00` defers `0x401bc0` onto the deadline heap, which drains at
//! `0x420d0c` and runs to completion in that one iteration, `Sleep(1)` residency spins and all) —
//! but the screen is raised *frames earlier*, at `TRANSFER_PENDING`, and dismissed *frames later*
//! by a per-frame readiness poll. Which is this file's shape. What an async-streaming client has to
//! build explicitly is not the lifecycle after all: it is the **input suppression** the blocking
//! stretch does not provide either (see [`input`], decision 1990). The screen
//! rises at the **transition edges and only those** — the character pick's `Connected` edge (before
//! the glue tears down) and `SMSG_TRANSFER_PENDING` (the portal walk-in), which are precisely the
//! reference's two entries into `0x406640`'s tail — all observed *here*, from the
//! messages/resources the net bridge already publishes. The destination **snap** is not one of
//! them: `SMSG_NEW_WORLD` and `SMSG_LOGIN_VERIFY_WORLD` are two handlers there (`0x401b00` /
//! `0x401de0`) and neither can reach the raise `0x406800` or the screen's map global `[0x82f00c]`,
//! so a snap only ends the wait its raise armed and can never re-point a live screen
//! ([`LoadingScreen::far_snap`]). And what a live screen *shows* is latched harder still: the
//! resolved texture, not the map id ([`LoadingScreen::art_resolved`], decision 2087). A residency backstop catches any
//! path with no edge, **in world only** — it used to fire at boot too, and that is what warmed the
//! world's pipelines behind the glue (0540), which only worked while a world was being streamed
//! there at all. Since 0777 none is, and the warm-up rides the entry cover instead. It clears when
//! the destination is **scene-presentable** ([`WorldLoadProgress`],
//! published by `terrain_stream` + the collider queue): every wanted tile spawned, the focus
//! neighbourhood's placements up, colliders quiet, the snap no longer awaited. Never anything
//! about the *body* — feet-on-ground is not a load condition (the flying-teleport hang, 0737).
