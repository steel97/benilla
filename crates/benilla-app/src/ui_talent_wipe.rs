//! Unlearning your talents — the class trainer's respec question, its dialog, and its answer
//! (decision 1580).
//!
//! **The law this module exists for: selecting the trainer's "I wish to unlearn my talents" line
//! unlearns nothing.** It makes the server close the gossip menu and ask
//! (`MSG_TALENT_WIPE_CONFIRM` inbound, vmangos `Player::SendTalentWipeConfirm` off
//! `GOSSIP_OPTION_UNLEARNTALENTS`); the reset happens only when the client sends the **same
//! opcode** back with the trainer's guid, at which point `Player::ResetTalents` runs and the
//! trainer casts 14867 "Untalent Visual Effect". Before this module the question was parsed as an
//! unknown opcode and dropped, so the line looked like it did nothing at all — the director's
//! "I can't unlearn my talents, the confirm window never pops up".
//!
//! It is the innkeeper bind's twin, not a talent-window affordance, and that is why it lives beside
//! [`crate::ui_binder`] rather than inside [`crate::ui_talent`]: same shape on the wire (a question
//! carrying a guid, an answer echoing it), same latch, same range gate, same free-standing dialog
//! over a gossip menu that is already gone. wow-re says so at the bytes
//! (`system/ui/scratch/gossip-icon-and-binder-flow.md` §5.3): the talent master
//! (`0xc4d7a0`/`0xc4d7a4`), the pet untrainer and the binder are **one latch/range family**, three
//! copies of a single shape.
//!
//! The Era surface it drives is the reference's own (`StaticPopup.lua:1289-1304`,
//! `UIParent.lua:123`/`533-538`):
//!
//! - the `CONFIRM_TALENT_WIPE` event, whose **one argument is the cost in copper** — the dialog's
//!   money frame, not its text (the text is a fixed GlobalString);
//! - `ConfirmTalentWipe()` — the dialog's Accept, the only call that sends the answer;
//! - `CheckTalentMasterDist()` — polled from the dialog's `OnUpdate`, and the dialog hides itself
//!   the frame it goes false.
//!
//! Both halves are **byte-pinned** against the reference's `0x5df980`, one function that serves
//! both directions of the opcode (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/talent-api.md` §ConfirmTalentWipe, and
//! the disassembly under it):
//!
//! 1. **Arrival** (`guid != 0`): resolve the unit, gate on `d² <= [0xc4c28c]` — the identical
//!    constant behind [`crate::target::SERVICE_RANGE_SQ`], which is what makes modelling the
//!    question as an [`NpcSession`] faithful rather than convenient — then latch guid + cost and
//!    `SignalEvent2(CONFIRM_TALENT_WIPE, "%d", cost)` at `0x5dfa3f`.
//! 2. **Accept** (`ConfirmTalentWipe()` calls the same function with a **zeroed** guid, which
//!    substitutes the latch): the same range gate, then a **client-side money check** —
//!    `cost > coinage` shows `ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_MONEY` (`DisplayError(0x25)`, `0x5dfa81`) and sends
//!    **nothing**; otherwise the answer goes out carrying the latched guid.
//!
//! **One deliberate deviation, and it is the zero guid.** vmangos answers a failed reset (no points
//! spent) by asking again with `trainer = 0` (`SkillHandler.cpp:52`; the field's own comment reads
//! "0 if player has no talents to reset"). At the bytes that lands on leg 2, not leg 1 — a zero
//! guid *is* the Accept path — so a 1.12 client re-sends the answer, is refused again, and the two
//! sit there trading packets. We treat a zero-guid question as what it means, "there is nothing to
//! ask", and drop it: no dialog, no send. A packet loop is not a look we owe anyone.
