//! Duels — the challenge, the countdown, the bounds timer, and the outcome line (decision 0633).
//!
//! The smallest complete multiplayer verb: no window of its own, two StaticPopups, four events,
//! four Era globals, and one descriptor-driven consequence — a duel opponent reads *hostile*, so
//! the whole targeting/attack stack lights up without a special case (see
//! [`crate::target::ring`]'s duel leg).
//!
//! **Both ends of every mechanism here are byte-pinned** — vmangos for what the server sends,
//! WoW.exe's own duel TU (`E:\build\buildWoW\WoW\Source\Ui\DuelInfo.cpp`, handlers registered at
//! `0x4d4710`) for what the client does with it. The laws this module implements, each with its
//! address:
//!
//! - **The challenge is symmetric** (`0x4d49d0`). `SMSG_DUEL_REQUESTED` goes to challenger and
//!   challenged alike. The client stores the arbiter guid, then compares the challenger guid
//!   against its own: **equal** ⇒ show `ERR_DUEL_REQUESTED` ("You have requested a duel.") and
//!   **immediately send `CMSG_DUEL_ACCEPTED`** (`call 0x4d4830` — a no-op server-side, which
//!   drops an accept from the initiator, but it is what goes on the wire); **different** ⇒ resolve
//!   the challenger's player object and fire `DUEL_REQUESTED` with its name.
//! - **The countdown is client-driven** (`0x4d4ae0` → `0x4d4930`, timer named `ProcessCountdown`).
//!   The wire carries milliseconds; the client divides by 1000, prints
//!   `format(DUEL_COUNTDOWN, n)` as a **CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM chat line** — not an on-screen banner —
//!   then decrements and re-arms a 1000 ms timer while non-zero. vmangos's 3000 therefore reads
//!   "Duel starting: 3 / 2 / 1" one second apart.
//! - **Completion** (`0x4d4b20`). Only acts if an arbiter is held. `started == 0` (the duel never
//!   began) additionally shows `ERR_DUEL_CANCELLED` ("Duel cancelled."). Either way the arbiter is
//!   cleared, `DUEL_FINISHED` fires, and any running countdown is cancelled.
//! - **The outcome line** (`0x4d4ba0`) is composed client-side from `SMSG_DUEL_WINNER`'s flag and
//!   two names against `DUEL_WINNER_KNOCKOUT` / `DUEL_WINNER_RETREAT`, and printed as
//!   CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM. The server broadcasts it to everyone nearby, so bystanders read it too.
//! - **Bounds** (`0x4d4aa0` / `0x4d4ac0`) are bare event fires; the 10 s forfeit clock and its
//!   text belong to the `DUEL_OUTOFBOUNDS` popup, and the *enforcement* is entirely the server's
//!   (`Player::CheckDuelDistance`: 75 yd out, 70 yd back in, 10 s to return).
//!
//! One deviation, stated rather than hidden (the ignore branch — `0x4d4a33`'s silent
//! `CMSG_DUEL_CANCELLED` for a challenge from an ignored player — is implemented as of decision
//! 0668, which supplied the ignore list it needs):
//!
//! 1. **The challenger's name is resolved asynchronously.** The reference reads it off the
//!    challenger's `CGPlayer` and fires nothing at all if the object is missing (`0x4d4a72`).
//!    benilla resolves through the [`NameCache`], which may need a `CMSG_NAME_QUERY` round trip —
//!    so the popup can arrive a frame or two late instead of never. In practice the challenger is
//!    always streamed (the duel spell's range is 10 yd), which is exactly the case where the
//!    reference has the name for free.
