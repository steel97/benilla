//! Faithful 1.12 world-doodad distance fade — the size-bucketed per-object alpha fade the reference
//! runs every frame in `FUN_00683f80` (the world-M2-doodad fade, called unconditionally from the world
//! render `FUN_00681070`). VERIFIED from `WoW.exe` 2026-06-01 (capstone disasm + raw PE byte reads of
//! the operands; the 9-agent reconcile workflow `wf_33fb17c5`).
//!
//! ## The mechanism (VERIFIED-bytefact)
//! Per doodad the engine computes `d = horizontal_distance(center.xy, camera.xy) − boundingRadius`
//! (center `rec+0x5c/0x60`, radius `rec+0x68`), then picks a fade band **purely by the doodad's
//! bounding-sphere radius** (the size split the user observed — big things stay, small props fade near):
//!
//! | bounding radius | fade band (start→end yd) | examples |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `> 7.0`         | never fades (`1.0`)      | trees, buildings — drawn until the frustum far-clip |
//! | `≤ 0.5`         | `40 → 50`                | fences, haystacks, pumpkins (fade nearest) |
//! | `0.5 … 2.5`     | `100 → 125`              | mid props |
//! | `2.5 … 7.0`     | `150 → 200`              | large props (far end clamped by farclip) |
//!
//! `fade = 1 − (d − start) / range`, clamped to `[0, 1]`; monotonic in size (bigger ⇒ fades farther).
//! `fade ≥ 1` ⇒ fully opaque (drawn); `fade ≤ 0` ⇒ culled (not added to the draw list). The scalar
//! flows `CM2Model+0x180` → `inst+0x19c` → batch alpha → the per-vertex **diffuse.a** consumed by the
//! cutout fragment shader, where the hard alpha test (`discard if tex0.a × diffuse.a < 224/255`) turns
//! a dropping `fade` into per-pixel edge-first erosion, and the **blend pass while `0 < fade < 1`**
//! makes the small-prop fade read as a soft gradient rather than the trees' hard cutout edge.
//!
//! Verified operand bytes (`WoW.exe`): radius cutoffs `0x810188=0.5`, `0x81018c=2.5`, `0x810190=7.0`;
//! band starts `0x8101a0/a4/a8 = 50/125/200` (ends) with ranges `0x810194/98/9c = 10/25/50`; `1.0` at
//! `0x7ff9d8`. This REFUTES an old static-RE claim of "no size/radius weighting" — a null byte-fact
//! lost to the user's direct observation.
