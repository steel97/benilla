//! The auction list sort (decision 1511 §6) — client-side, because the wire carries no sort field
//! at all: `CMSG_AUCTION_LIST_ITEMS` is ten fields and none of them is a column.
//!
//! **It is not an asc → desc → none cycle**, which is the thing everyone assumes and gets wrong.
//! Each list owns a *most-recently-clicked stack* of up to eight `(key, reversed)` pairs. Clicking
//! the column that is already primary toggles its direction; clicking any other column promotes it
//! to primary **keeping the direction it already remembers**. Two consequences fall out, and both
//! are visible in the window: a column that is not currently sorting anything can still draw a
//! flipped arrow, and the sort is *stable across keys* — dropping "quality" to second place still
//! breaks ties by it.
//!
//! **VERIFIED** (wow-re §5, TU-5, `system/ui/scratch/auction-house.md`): `0x4cd940` *is* the
//! auction comparator, the sort *is* an 8-key MRU cascade, and each list owns its own `{col,dir}`
//! stack. The per-key directions below are that verdict's, not our guess — three of them were
//! wrong when this file first landed, and all three were ones a shopping UI makes the "obvious"
//! way round.
