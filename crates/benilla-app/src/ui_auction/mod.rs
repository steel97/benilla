//! The app-side **auction feed** (decision 1511 P1) — the inward half of the auction seam around
//! [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `auction` module, the auctioneer twin of [`crate::ui_merchant`]'s
//! vendor seam and [`crate::ui_mail`]'s mailbox one.
//!
//! **The window is opened by the server, not by the click.** A right-click on an auctioneer
//! ([`crate::target`]) sends `MSG_AUCTION_HELLO` and nothing else happens; the *reply* — the same
//! opcode coming back with the auctioneer guid and an `AuctionHouse.dbc` house id — is what opens
//! the session here (wow-re: the window's opener calls `SetInteractNPC` and fires
//! `AUCTION_HOUSE_SHOW` from inside the hello handler). That house id is load-bearing rather than
//! decorative: it keys the deposit rate the sell pane displays, and the six faction houses charge
//! 5% where the neutral goblin house charges 25%.
//!
//! **Three lists, one session.** Browse (`"list"`), Bids (`"bidder"`) and Auctions (`"owner"`) are
//! three independent server queries into one window. Each holds at most one 50-row page — the
//! server's own cap — plus the pre-cap match count the pager needs, plus its own sort stack.
//!
//! **Sorting is ours and paging is the server's**, which is the split that shapes this module: a
//! header click re-orders rows we already hold and sends nothing ([`sort`]), while a page turn
//! re-sends the whole query. Nothing about the sort ever reaches the wire.
//!
//! **The browse throttle is real and it is silent.** The client refuses a browse query inside 5 s
//! of the last one and *drops it with no failure event*, which is why the Search button polls
//! [`benilla_ui::script::UiScript::set_auction_can_query`] every frame instead of reacting to a
//! refusal. The window opening clears the gate, so the first search is always allowed. (INTERIM,
//! decision 1511 — pinned to the in-flight §5's TU-2.)
//!
//! The net bridge ([`crate::net::apply::auction`]) fills [`AuctionOpen`] from the wire. Each frame
//! [`feed_auction`] resolves each [`AuctionListEntry`] to a Lua-facing row (name/quality/icon via
//! the ask-once item-template cache + `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc`, seller via the ask-once name cache,
//! the time-left bucket from the wire's milliseconds), applies the sort, pushes the snapshot, and
//! fires the events the reference Lua drives. [`drain_auction`] pulls the Lua intents back out
//! into the auction `CMSG`s. The standardized NPC-session range guard ([`crate::ui_session`])
//! client-side-closes the window when the player walks away from the auctioneer. That radius is
//! **VERIFIED** rather than borrowed (wow-re §5 TU-6): the auction window's own interaction cell
//! holds `30.864194869995117` — a radius of `5.5555553` yd — which is exactly the service gate
//! the cursor already greys at, so the guard's existing constant is the right one. The close
//! sends no packet, also byte-confirmed.
