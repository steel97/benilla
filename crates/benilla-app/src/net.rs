//! The network↔ECS bridge: a typed-event channel into real ECS entities (decision 0006).
//!
//! A background **read** thread owns the blocking [`WorldSession`] (logon → world handshake → enter
//! world) and streams the world as a flat list of [`SessionEvent`]s over a channel; a sibling
//! **write** thread owns the writer and drains [`ClientCommand`]s. One ECS system,
//! [`apply_net_updates`], drains the event channel each frame and mutates **real Bevy entities** —
//! spawn on create, transform-write on move, despawn on remove — keyed by a [`Guid`] component with a
//! [`GuidIndex`] for O(1) lookup. There is no shadow world: a unit is one entity, full stop.
//!
//! Movement paths become a [`Spline`] component sampled by [`sample_splines`]; the server clock
//! becomes the [`ServerTime`] resource; one-shot directives (teleport, worldport) become Bevy
//! [`Message`]s the player/terrain consume. Outbound movement + chat go through [`NetCommands`].
//!
//! The bridge runs in [`WorldStage::Net`], before `Input`, so a server teleport snaps → streams →
//! covers in one frame. Coordinates cross from raw WoW into Bevy space here (`wow_to_bevy`).
