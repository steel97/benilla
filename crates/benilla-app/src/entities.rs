//! player's body resolves through the same creature chain, decision 0041), GameObjects as their model
//! (`GameObjectCatalog`), and everything else as a colored cube.
//!
//! The entity itself — its identity, pose, and movement — is owned by the net bridge: `apply_net_updates`
//! spawns one real ECS entity per server guid (with a [`Transform`] driven by `sample_splines`), and this

//! snapshot and no entity side-map: a unit *is* one entity.
//!
//! Models load through the standard `AssetServer` as `Handle<M2Model>`/`Handle<WmoModel>` (the same
//! `mpq://` pipeline the terrain streamer uses) — deduped + async, no main-thread parse. Per display id
//! we keep a [`DisplayModel`]: its handle + (for creatures) its skin variations, and the spawn parts
//! built once the asset loads (creature `Monster1/2/3` skin slots filled here from the display's
