//! **Which build is this?** — the commit the running binary was built from, stamped in at
//! compile time by the `benilla` launcher shim's `build.rs` (which owns the *how*, including why
//! the stamp can't go stale — and why it is stamped into the ~30-line shim rather than this
//! crate: cargo re-dirties whatever package carries the stamp on every commit, decision 0993)
//! and handed to [`crate::run`] as the [`BuildId`] resource.
//!
//! A report from someone else's machine — "the water reads wrong here", "it panicked on login" —
//! is only actionable against known code, and nothing else in the binary identifies it: the crate
//! version is a permanent `0.1.0`, and people build from a clone of the public snapshot repo whose
//! HEAD moves with every sync. So the sha is the version.
//!
//! Two surfaces, deliberately:
//!
//! - **The startup log line** ([`banner`], run from [`crate::preflight`]'s banner family) — this is
//!   the one that matters for someone else's run. They launch from a terminal, so the id is already
//!   in the output they paste; nobody has to know a hotkey to answer "what are you on?".
//! - **The debug panel's footer** (`` ` ``) — the same line where the reader already is when they
//!   are looking at a readout, click-to-copy for the full sha.
//!
//! Mapping a reported sha back: a **public** snapshot sha is tagged `pub/<short-sha>` on the private
//! commit it shipped, so `git show pub/<sha>` (or `git rev-parse pub/<sha>^{commit}`) names the code
//! exactly; a **private** sha is just a commit here.
