//! **What kind of run is this, and whose** — the always-present layer, on the player's side of the
//! `dev` seam (decisions 0026 / 1173, built in 1174).
//!
//! Everything here answers a question about *the run itself*, and every answer has a
//! **player-faithful default**: nobody is driving the camera, the client starts at the login
//! screen, no rig owns the character pick, this checkout belongs to nobody in particular. A dev
//! build's instruments then move those answers off their defaults — which is the one direction the
//! seam allows. Gameplay reads this module; gameplay never reads `capture`, `debug_panel` or
//! `perf`.
//!
//! It exists because the alternative kept losing. 0026 asked for "a player-safe home or default"
//! for exactly this class of fact in June 2026 and named two of them; by August there were 24
//! references from non-dev code into the instruments (1173), because the facts had no home and the
//! nearest thing that already knew the answer was the instrument itself.
//!
//! The engine drew the same line for itself one layer down: [`benilla_world::dev_state`]'s
//! `deterministic_run` reads `$WOW_CAPTURE` on its own account, because "run deterministically" is
//! a property of the world and the world must be able to ask it with no harness above it at all.
//! **One environment variable, several readers, no shared symbol** — that is the pattern, and
//! [`scenario_active`] below is its app-side twin. Keep the two in step.
