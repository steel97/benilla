//! The app-side **trade feed** (decision 0592 P1) — the inward half of the trade seam around
//! [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `trade` module, the two-sided twin of [`crate::ui_mail`]'s mailbox seam.
//!
//! Trade is entirely server-driven: a right-click → **Trade** ([`crate::ui_trade`] via the UnitPopup
//! row) sends `CMSG_INITIATE_TRADE`; the packet handlers ([`net`]) then fold the two
//! status packets into [`TradeSession`] — `SMSG_TRADE_STATUS` drives the open/accept/close state
//! machine, `SMSG_TRADE_STATUS_EXTENDED` replaces one side's item/gold snapshot. Each frame
//! [`feed_trade`] resolves both sides' wire [`TradeItem`]s to Lua-facing
//! [`benilla_ui::script::TradeSlotItem`]s (name/quality via the ask-once item-template cache, icon via
//! the wire `display_id` + `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc`) and the partner's name (via the name cache), pushes
//! the snapshot ([`benilla_ui::script::UiScript::set_trade`]), and fires the events the reference Lua
//! drives — `TRADE_SHOW` on open, `TRADE_UPDATE` on any offer change, `TRADE_CLOSED` on close, and
//! `TRADE_ACCEPT_UPDATE(myState, theirState)` on an accept-glow change. [`drain_trade`] pulls the Lua
//! intents (`InitiateTrade`/`AcceptTrade`/`CancelTradeAccept`/`CloseTrade`) back out into the trade
//! `CMSG`s.
//!
//! **An incoming request is answered here, not on the wire** (decision 1764).
//! `SMSG_TRADE_STATUS(BEGIN_TRADE)` only *records* the request; [`answer_trade_request`] walks the
//! reference's own eight-leg ladder (`0x4bf736`) and either refuses it — on one of three different
//! opcodes, or with no packet at all — or accepts it, which is what the client did unconditionally
//! before. The split is what made the ladder possible when it was built: it reads the ignore
//! list, the cinematic state, player control, the auction house, the initiator's descriptor, an
//! outbound initiate of ours and the [`BlockTrades`] CVar, none of which could reach the drain's
//! dispatch match at Bevy's 16-`SystemParam` ceiling (decision 1725 left the cinematic leg unbuilt
//! for exactly that reason and said so). Since 2306 the status packet is this module's own
//! handler ([`net`]) and that ceiling is gone; what keeps the ladder a system of its own is that
//! its answer may **span frames**, which a packet handler cannot do.
//!
//! **There is no consent prompt, and that is faithful rather than missing.** 1.12.1 registers a
//! `TRADE_REQUEST` event and signals it from nowhere, so the `TRADE` StaticPopup that would have
//! asked is dead code in the real client (§5 cross-checked — wow-re
//! `ui/scratch/incoming-trade-request-law.md` §3). benilla wired that dialog up and took it back
//! out (decision 1764): the reference's answer to an unwanted trade is the ignore list and the
//! *Block Trades* checkbox, both of which are legs of the ladder below.
//!
//! **The partner's portrait** rides the shared `"npc"` booth token: [`TradeSession`] implements
//! [`NpcSession`] so [`crate::ui_session::feed_interact_npc`] points the `"npc"` portrait at the
//! partner's live entity while the window is open — the partner is a nearby player (within
//! `TRADE_DISTANCE`, always streamed), so the booth bakes their dressed look exactly as it bakes a
//! vendor's. Trade is deliberately **excluded** from the range-guard auto-close
//! ([`crate::ui_session::close_npc_session_out_of_range`]): unlike the NPC windows (a no-packet local
//! clear), a trade's out-of-range cancel is server-driven (vmangos sends `CANCELED` past
//! `TRADE_DISTANCE`), and the walk-away/death/disconnect unwinding is decision 0592 P3.
//!
//! **Scope (decision 0592 P1).** The window opens, mirrors both sides' items + gold live, and drives
//! the accept glow (the accept verb is a wire pass-through: click Trade → `CMSG_ACCEPT_TRADE`, and a
//! 200 ms scam-delay bounce comes back as `BACK_TO_TRADE` and drops the glow honestly). **Setting**
//! items/gold onto the window — the drag-drop slots + the editable money widget — is decision 0592 P2.
