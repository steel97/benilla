//! The probe shield (decision 0677) — **a probe body cannot die, and does not need GM mode to stay
//! alive.**
//!
//! ## The failure it removes
//!
//! Probe characters kept dying, and the reason was structural: the only protection we had was **GM
//! mode**, and GM mode is exactly what a session has to switch off to measure anything real.
//! `Player::SetGameMaster(true)` re-templates the player to faction 35 ("Friendly", enemy mask 0)
//! and freezes the mirror timers, so with it on nothing is hostile, nothing aggros, environmental
//! damage is skipped and breath/fatigue never tick (0649, 0657). Every session doing hostility,
//! reaction-colour, nameplate, threat, damage or drowning work therefore sends `.gm off` — and the
//! moment it does, the body is a level-1 standing wherever the last session parked it. Measured on
//! this project's own transcripts: `.gm off` **257×**, `.revive` **121×** (0651). Measured live
//! while writing this: `.gm off` on a probe parked in Valley of Spears killed it in **~2 seconds**,
//! inside the gap between two probe-chat lines.
//!
//! Telling sessions to "put GM mode back when you are done" was the old advice and it cannot work:
//! it asks every session to remember a manual step at the exact moment it is thinking about
//! something else, and it trades one silent wrongness (a dead probe) for another (faction 35).
//!
//! ## What it does instead
//!
//! vmangos has a second, *invisible* protection: **`.cheat god`**
//! (`Player::SetCheatGod` → `SetInvincibilityHpThreshold(1)`). `Unit::DealDamage` then clamps every
//! hit at 1 hp instead of calling `Kill` — and `Player::EnvironmentalDamage` (fall, lava, slime,
//! drowning, fatigue) routes through the same `DealDamage`, so it is covered too. Unlike GM mode it
//! touches **nothing** a client can see: no `UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS` bit, no `PLAYER_FLAGS` bit, no
//! faction re-template, no frozen timers. Damage still lands, combat still happens, hostility is
//! still faithful — the body simply cannot reach 0.
//!
//! **The shield is therefore always on** — and, since it does not stop *aggro*, GM mode **stays on
//! by default too** (decision 0679). The two do different jobs: GM mode stops the town attacking a
//! parked body, the shield stops anything killing it. Without the shield, `.gm off` was a two-second
//! death sentence; with it, `.gm off` (`WOW_GM=off`) is a free, safe switch a session flips whenever
//! it needs faithful factions. That — making the drop safe, not making it the default — is the whole
//! win. A shielded body with GM off in a hostile camp survives, but survives *pinned*: 1 hp, stunned,
//! permanently in combat, never regenerating, which is its own kind of useless.
//!
//! ## The three things about it that are not obvious
//!
//! 1. **It is not persisted**, and that leaves a window nothing here can close.
//!    `m_invincibilityHpThreshold` is a runtime `Unit` member, zeroed in the constructor and never
//!    saved, so it must be re-sent on **every world entry** — which is why this is a client module
//!    and not a one-off DB fix. But a command cannot be sent before we are *in* the world, so a body
//!    parked somewhere hostile is unshielded for the few hundred ms it takes to get the first line
//!    out. MEASURED: a probe left at 1 hp in a centaur camp entered the world at `29.41`, had the
//!    shield confirmed at `29.75` (+337 ms) and was already **dead** when the banner printed at
//!    `29.97`. This is the "it was alive at 1 hp when I closed the window, it was dead next login"
//!    report, and it is why **GM mode stays on by default** (0679): the fix is to never let the body
//!    be whittled down and mobbed in the first place, not to arm faster.
//! 2. **It is target-sensitive.** `.cheat god on` re-targets to the current selection
//!    (`ChatHandler::GetSelectedPlayer` → `sObjectMgr.GetPlayer(guid)`), which is `nullptr` for a
//!    creature — the server answers *"Player not found!"* and the body is left mortal. VERIFIED
//!    live: with a centaur Tab-selected the bare form was refused, and the same command with the
//!    name appended succeeded before and after. So we **always name the character**.
//! 3. **`.die` clears it silently.** `HandleDieHelper` calls `SetCheatGod(false)` with
//!    `notify = false` before killing, so deliberate death-testing still works out of the box —
//!    but the shield is down afterwards and nothing says so. Hence the death watch below.
//!
//! ## What it never touches
//!
//! Only a body on a **probe account** (`probe<N>`). The director's own account is never given a
//! command it did not ask for, whether they typed the login or an env var did.
//!
//! ## Knobs
//!
//! - `WOW_GM=off` — drop GM mode, for anything about hostility, reaction colour, nameplates,
//!   threat, aggro, damage or breath/fatigue. Safe now, which is the point. `WOW_RIG="… gm:off"` is
//!   honoured the same way, so the rig's explicit token wins over the default.
//! - `WOW_GOD=off` — run unshielded (a death-arc test that wants a real corpse). Reported as a
//!   `WARN` finding on the preflight banner, because the body can now die.
