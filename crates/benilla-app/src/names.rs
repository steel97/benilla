//! Unit-name resolution — the query-cache seam of decision 0068 §3.
//!
//! The 1.12 wire carries **no names in descriptors**: a player's name answers `CMSG_NAME_QUERY`
//! (keyed by guid), a creature's answers `CMSG_CREATURE_QUERY` (keyed by the template *entry*
//! embedded in its guid, shared by every spawn of that template — exactly how the real client
//! recovers it). This module owns the cache and the **ask-once** discipline: a consumer calls
//! [`NameCache::resolve`], which returns the name when known and otherwise issues the query (deduped
//! while in flight) and reports "not yet". The net bridge ([`crate::net`]) fills the cache from the
//! decoded `PlayerName`/`CreatureName` events and clears the in-flight sets on disconnect (a query
//! dropped by a dead writer must be re-askable after reconnect).
//!
//! A *negative* answer (the server doesn't know the guid/entry) is cached too — resolving to
//! "unknown, and asking again won't help" — so a bad id can never turn into a query loop.
