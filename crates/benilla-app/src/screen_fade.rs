//! The engine's screen fade — the whole frame to black, and back.
//!
//! This is the reference's own facility, not a cinematic's private effect. Two entry points, both
//! taking a duration in seconds:
//!
//! - **`0x4c0d10(ecx = completion fn, edx = its arg, [ebp+8] = seconds)` — fade OUT to black.** It
//!   latches the completion pair and arms the fade; **the completion runs when the screen reaches
//!   full black**, not after a delay on a parallel clock.
//! - **`0x4c1280(ecx, edx, seconds)` — fade IN from black.** A no-op unless a fade is currently up.
//!
//! That distinction is the whole reason this module exists rather than a `Timer` at each call site.
//! A cinematic boundary is not "wait 0.25 s, then advance" — it is "go black, and *when you are
//! black*, advance". The two coincide only while the frame rate holds; under a hitch (and the shot
//! boundary is exactly where the reference does a blocking terrain load) a delay-driven sequence
//! shows the cut, and a completion-driven one cannot. See `wow-5875-re`
//! `system/ui/scratch/cinematic-camera-law.md` §3.7, which verified this as a correction to an
//! earlier reading that had it as a delay.
//!
//! **The completion callback does not cross into this module.** The reference stores a function
//! pointer; an ECS system cannot, and faking it with a boxed closure in a `Resource` would buy
//! nothing. Instead this owns only the ramp — alpha and phase — and exposes [`ScreenFade::is_black`]
//! as a *level*. The caller keeps its own "which step is pending" state and runs it while black.
//! Same sequencing, with the step left where it can see the data it needs.
//!
//! The one caller today is `crate::cinematic`. It is written as the general facility because that
//! is what it is in the reference (`0x4c0d10` has callers well outside the cinematic band), not in
//! anticipation of a second one here.
