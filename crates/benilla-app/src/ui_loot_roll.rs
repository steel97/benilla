//! The app-side **group-loot-roll feed** (decision 0591) — the inward half of the roll seam around
//! [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `loot_roll` module, the sibling of [`crate::ui_loot`]'s window seam.
//!
//! When the group's loot method is group/need-before-greed and a drop is at or above the quality
//! threshold, the server does not put the item in anyone's loot window; it opens a **roll** on it
//! and every eligible looter gets a `GroupLootFrame` with Need/Greed/Pass and a one-minute bar.
//!
//! The net bridge ([`crate::net::apply`]) fills [`LootRolls`] from the wire: `SMSG_LOOT_START_ROLL`
//! → a fresh roll with a client-allocated id ([`LootRolls::start`]); `SMSG_LOOT_ROLL` → one
//! announcement line ([`LootRolls::announce`]); `SMSG_LOOT_ROLL_WON` / `SMSG_LOOT_ALL_PASSED` → the
//! resolution line plus the roll's close ([`LootRolls::won`] / [`LootRolls::all_passed`]).
//!
//! Each frame [`feed_loot_rolls`] ticks every open roll's remaining time, resolves each to a
//! Lua-facing [`LootRollEntry`], pushes the snapshot
//! ([`benilla_ui::script::UiScript::set_loot_rolls`]), fires `START_LOOT_ROLL(rollID, rollTime)` for
//! each newly opened roll and `CANCEL_LOOT_ROLL(rollID)` for each closed one, and drains the queued
//! announcement lines into the chat window once their names resolve. [`drain_loot_rolls`] pulls the
//! `RollOnLoot` votes back out as [`ClientCommand::LootRoll`].
//!
//! ## The late item template, and the hold that answers it
//!
//! A `GroupLootFrame` paints **once**, from its `OnShow`, off whatever `GetLootRollItemInfo`
//! answers at that instant. Ours answers out of a **pushed snapshot**, and a snapshot is at least
//! one step behind the thing that changed it — twice over:
//!
//! 1. A roll is added to [`LootRolls::active`] by [`LootRolls::start`], so the *first* snapshot
//!    that contains a roll is built in the same pass that would announce it. Push before the
//!    announce and the OnShow sees it; announce first and it paints a blank.
//! 2. `name`/`texture`/`quality`/`bindOnPickUp` come from the ask-once item-template cache and are
//!    `None` until the query lands, which is typically several frames after the roll opens.
//!
//! (1) is fixed by ordering — the push precedes the events here, as it does in [`crate::ui_loot`].
//!
//! (2) is **bug B371**: a reported roll frame came up with an empty icon slot and no name, and
//! kept both for the roll's full minute. The fix is decision 2010's, and it is not a seam of ours — **it is the gate the
//! reference already has**, which decision 1805 named in one line while looking at the window next
//! door and which the disassembly settles:
//!
//! > `0x61b310`, the `SMSG_LOOT_START_ROLL` handler, allocates and lists the roll node and then
//! > ends in the item-template cache lookup `0x55ba30(node+0x1c, node+0x10, 0x61b460, node, 0)`.
//! > A **hit** (non-zero return) calls `0x61b430`, which fires `START_LOOT_ROLL (0x1f9, "%d%d")`.
//! > A **miss** issues the query and leaves the callback `0x61b460` armed — a trampoline whose
//! > worker is that same `0x61b430` — so on a cold cache the event fires from the cache *arrival*,
//! > not from the packet. (wow-re `system/object-layer/scratch/lootroll-chat-and-lifecycle.md` §5
//! > and `scratch/w2e-decomp.c`'s `FUN_0061b310`/`FUN_0061b430`.)
//!
//! So `GetLootRollItemInfo`'s cache-miss tail is nearly unreachable in the real client, and was our
//! common case. There is no repaint to fall back on — the same finding 1805 landed for
//! `LOOT_OPENED` one window over. Our retired `GroupLootFrame` re-entered its paint from a
//! benilla-only `UPDATE_LOOT_ROLL(rollID)`; 1838 migrated the frame to the stock one, which has no
//! such seam, and 1883 removed the event once nothing was listening for it.
//!
//! [`feed_loot_rolls`] therefore **holds a fresh roll's `START_LOOT_ROLL` until its template
//! answers**. Two releases are ours rather than the reference's, and both are the ones 1805 already
//! reasoned through for the loot window:
//!
//! - a **negative** answer — the server does not know the entry — fires the event anyway. The
//!   reference's callback is success-gated, but a roll frame that never opens is a roll we cannot
//!   even *pass* on, and the cache-miss tail is exactly what the reference paints in the
//!   neighbouring case.
//! - a **deadline** ([`TEMPLATE_HOLD_MAX_MS`]) fires it if no answer arrives at all, because unlike
//!   a pending chat line this wait is paid out of the roll's own minute.
//!
//! `arg2` stays the **wire's** countdown on a held roll, because that is what `0x61b430` pushes
//! (`node+0x3c`, the packet field). Only the bar moves: `GetLootRollTimeLeft` is
//! `node+0x28 - now()` off a deadline stamped when the *packet* arrived, so a roll announced late
//! opens with its bar already a sliver down — which is [`ActiveRoll::remaining_ms`] ticking from
//! [`LootRolls::start`], unchanged.
//!
//! ## Two client-side behaviours, and why
//!
//! - **`rollID` is ours.** The wire addresses a roll by `(lootedTarget, itemSlot)`; the FrameXML API
//!   addresses it by an opaque `rollID`. Nothing on the wire depends on its value, so
//!   [`LootRolls::next_id`] hands out a monotonic one per roll and the drain maps it back.
//! - **Our own vote closes our frame immediately** ([`LootRolls::vote`]) — client-predicted, not
//!   waiting for the server's resolution, the same shape as the 0515 loot-kneel latch. The server
//!   echoes our vote as an ordinary `SMSG_LOOT_ROLL` announcement and only resolves the roll once
//!   *everyone* has voted or the minute expires, so a server-driven close would leave our frame up
//!   for up to a minute after we clicked. **VERIFIED** in the 5875 binary (decision 0594, resolving
//!   0591's deferral): `RollOnLoot` at `0x61bdf0` sends the CMSG and fires `CANCEL_LOOT_ROLL`
//!   itself, in the same call — the client-side close is the real behaviour, not an approximation.
//! - **…except on a bind-on-pickup roll**, where a Need or Greed sends *nothing* and leaves the
//!   frame up: the seam raises `CONFIRM_LOOT_ROLL` instead, and only the popup's `ConfirmLootRoll`
//!   re-enters past the gate (decision 0594; the gate is in the real client's C `RollOnLoot`, so it
//!   lives in our seam too — see [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `loot_roll`). Pass is never gated.
