//! The trainer window's two **byte-transcribed laws** — the icon and the tooltip.
//!
//! They live together because they are the same *kind* of thing (a direct transcription of one Lua
//! binding each, with the binary's addresses in the doc), and apart from the feed because they are
//! the part that must never drift toward "what seems consistent". The whole point of both records
//! is that they **disagree with each other** on the same row: the icon needs a trainer-type gate the
//! tooltip does not have, and the icon pins the *wire* wrapper where the tooltip hops to the
//! *taught* spell. On ~806 of the shipped corpus's trainer services the reference client visibly
//! shows one spell's icon above another spell's tooltip. Putting them side by side makes that
//! deliberate, and makes a future "unification" obviously wrong rather than obviously tidy.
//!
//! Sources: wow-re `system/ui/scratch/spell-icon-substitution-law.md` §1 (the icon) and
//! `system/ui/scratch/trainer-service-tooltip-law.md` (the tooltip).

/// The trainer's **icon law** — `GetTrainerServiceIcon 0x4d8f50`, byte-verified whole in wow-re
/// (`system/ui/scratch/spell-icon-substitution-law.md` §1; the binding is not a marshal, the entire
/// resolution is inlined there). Three gates, then a fallback:
///
/// 1. **The trainer type is 2** (tradeskill/profession — `[0xb73a08]`, the trainer-list packet's
///    type dword stored verbatim). A class/mount/pet trainer never substitutes.
/// 2. **The WIRE spell has a learn-wrapper effect** in any of its three slots —
///    `SPELL_EFFECT_LEARN_SPELL` or `SPELL_EFFECT_LEARN_PET_SPELL` (`0x4d8ff5`/`0x4d8ffa`). The
///    **first** matching slot wins; its `EffectTriggerSpell` is the taught spell.
/// 3. **That taught spell creates an item** (`EffectItemType[0] != 0`, `0x4d906a`) → the created
///    item's `ItemDisplayInfo` icon.
///
/// Otherwise: the **WIRE (wrapper) spell's own `SpellIconID`** (`0x4d9008`). This is the fact
/// benilla had backwards — `esi` is pinned to the wire record at `0x4d8fd7` and is never reassigned
/// on any path reaching the fallback, so **the client never paints the taught spell's own icon at a
/// trainer**. We used to, which is what put a blue `Spell_Shadow_SealOfKings` crown on Copper
/// Shortsword: spell 2756 (the wrapper the server sends) hops to 2739 (the recipe), whose own
/// `SpellIconID` is that crown — while the law wants item 2847's sword.
///
/// A gate-3 hit whose item template is not cached yet returns `None` (the client pushes Lua `nil`
/// and repaints on the cache callback, `0x4d9140` → `TRAINER_UPDATE`). Our equivalent is free: the
/// template answer changes the snapshot, so [`feed_trainer`]'s diff re-fires `TRAINER_UPDATE` on its
/// own.

/// returns a [`TrainerTooltip`] rather than any text.

///     if WIRE.Effect[i] in {36 LEARN_SPELL, 57 LEARN_PET_SPELL}:
///         t = WIRE.EffectTriggerSpell[i]

///             if TAUGHT.Attributes & 0x20:               # the ITEM route

/// return Spell(WIRE.id, altCaster = false)               # the only path describing the wrapper
/// ```
///
/// Three things a re-implementation gets wrong by default, all of them ours to get right here:
///
/// - **The scan is stricter than the icon's.** A slot whose `EffectTriggerSpell[i]` is out of range
///   or resolves to a NULL row advances to the *next* slot (`jl`/`jg` → `0x5339f0`); the icon
///   binding's first match wins outright. So the two can pick different slots on the same row.
/// - **`Effect[0] == 24` is NOT the item-vs-spell decision** — `Attributes & 0x20` alone is. The
///   effect test only picks *which slot* the item id comes from, because the spell builder
///   `0x52e610` re-applies the same Attributes bit itself at `0x52e6d2` and redirects to the item
///   builder with `EffectItemType[0]`. A client that treats `Effect[0]==24` as the gate renders a
///   spell tooltip where the reference renders an item one. (Divergence population on the shipped
///   `Spell.dbc`: 1161 spells carry the bit, 1159 with `Effect[0]==24`; the two that don't — 2479
///   and 7920 — have `EffectItemType` all-zero, so both routes end at an empty tooltip.)
/// - **It hops where the icon pins.** [`service_icon`] describes the WIRE wrapper on its fallback;
///   this describes the TAUGHT spell on every path that resolves one, and has no trainer-type gate
///   at all. On ~806 shipped services that means one spell's icon over another spell's tooltip —
///   the reference client's own behaviour, not a bug to reconcile.
