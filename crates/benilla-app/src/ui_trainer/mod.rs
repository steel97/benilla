//! The app-side **trainer feed** (decision 0237 phase 3) — the inward half of the trainer seam
//! around [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `trainer` module, the twin of [`crate::ui_merchant`]'s merchant
//! feed.
//!
//! The net bridge fills [`TrainerOpen`] from the wire (`SMSG_TRAINER_LIST` → the trainer's services +
//! greeting, reached through the gossip trainer option). Each frame [`feed_trainer`] resolves each
//! wire [`TrainerSpell`] to a Lua-facing [`TrainerService`] — name/subtext from the spell catalog
//! (`Spell.dbc`, loaded whole at startup), the **icon** from its own byte-verified law
//! ([`service_icon`], which at a *tradeskill* trainer fronts the taught recipe's created item and so
//! does need the ask-once item-template query the item rows use), the skill-requirement name from
//! the skill-line catalog, the green/red/gray state straight off the wire
//! `state` byte — pushes the snapshot ([`UiScript::set_trainer`]), and fires `TRAINER_SHOW` on open /
//! `TRAINER_UPDATE` on a content change / `TRAINER_CLOSED` on clear. [`drain_trainer`] pulls the Lua
//! intents back out: the Train button's `BuyTrainerService` → `CMSG_TRAINER_BUY_SPELL` for the open
//! trainer, and `CloseTrainer` → a local clear (vanilla's client-side close sends no packet). A
//! successful buy answers `SMSG_TRAINER_BUY_SUCCEEDED` — the spell itself lands via
//! `SMSG_LEARNED_SPELL` (already in the book), and the net apply re-requests the list to repaint the
//! bought row green→gray; a refusal (`SMSG_TRAINER_BUY_FAILED`) stages into [`TrainerErrors`] for the
//! feed to surface on the window's red error line.
//!
//! The standardized NPC-session range guard ([`crate::ui_session`]) client-side-closes the window
//! when the player walks out of the trainer's service range (or the trainer despawns) — the same
//! `CloseTrainer` clear.
