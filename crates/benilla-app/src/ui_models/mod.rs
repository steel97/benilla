//! **UI model tiles** (decision 2008) — the renderer for a `<Model>` widget's M2: the cooldown
//! sweep, the autocast shine, the minimap and world-map pings, the item-push card, the map's
//! arrow, and whatever an addon parks in a `CreateFrame("Model")`.
//!
//! ## The law (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/modelframe-render-law.md`, `e1b1794b`)
//!
//! A `<Model>` **whose file supplies a camera** draws its scene through it: the widget holds a raw
//! camera index (ctor 0, `SetCamera(n)`), and the record's `lookAt(eye, target, up)` plus the
//! client's diagonal-FOV projection at the pane's own width/height frame the model (§2, camera-law
//! §4a). The authored eye and target are carried through the model's root transform, so
//! `SetModelScale` and `SetPosition` cancel for framing on that leg and bite only on the record's
//! unscaled near/far. An index past the file's camera count installs a NULL camera, which is the
//! other leg:
//!
//! A `<Model>` with no M2 camera picked draws its scene **orthographically over the frame's
//! rect**: origin at the rect's bottom-left, `+X` right, `+Y` up, `Z` depth only, with the root
//! matrix `T(pos · layoutScale) · R(facing, +Z) · S(G48 · 5/3 · modelScale · layoutScale)` — so one
//! model unit is `1280 · modelScale · layoutScale` FrameXML units, aspect-independent (§2/§3).
//! Every batch draws once, LEQUAL over a depth buffer cleared for the widget's own rect, straight
//! into the back buffer (§6); every in-game UI M2 is UNLIT on every material (§5.7); the
//! animator is the world's, on the widget's private clock (§4). A particle's half-extent is the
//! one quantity outside the unit law — added in eye space, it maps at `768 · √(a²+1)` FrameXML
//! units per model unit and carries neither scale (`clip-and-scale.md` §6).
//!
//! ## The shape here: tiles in one atlas, composited at the callback rank
//!
//! The reference draws into the back buffer between two 2-D batches; this engine's UI is one
//! quad pass, so a scene becomes a **tile**: every visible pane holding a file renders into its
//! own cell of one shared render-target atlas, at the pane's device-pixel size, through ONE
//! orthographic camera whose view is the atlas plane — each tile's model root is placed at its
//! cell, scaled to pixels per model unit, and the camera never moves. [`compose_tiles`] then
//! draws every cell as a premultiplied quad over its pane's rect at `ZKey::callback(Artwork)`
//! (1995's rank — after every texture and font string of the pane's layer), which is the same
//! picture the reference's callback drain produces: the cell is cleared to transparent like the
//! reference clears its depth, the 2-D layers under it stay under it, and the ones over it stay
//! over it. Cells never overlap, so one depth buffer serves every tile.
//!
//! **The composite is this renderer's per-frame output, never the extract's** (decision 2023).
//! The extract's `ModelPane` arm publishes the request — the pane's rect, paint key, alpha and
//! clip beside the unit ladder — and pushes no quad; the quad is appended in the
//! [`UiQuadAppend`] lane (the minimap fill's lane) from THIS frame's cells. The first shape had
//! the arm draw the cell it found in the bridge, which is last frame's at best and, because the
//! conversion is memoized on the engine's list, usually never: a cooldown armed on a quiet
//! interface extracted once (no cell yet), the cell arrived a frame later, and nothing ever
//! re-ran the conversion — the sweep drew only while the interface happened to be churning (the
//! stance bar at UI load), and never on an action press.
//!
//! The pipeline is the booths' (`crate::portrait`): the same HDR view shape, the same
//! `FfxGlow::UI_PANE` decode, the same material twin with only the light storage swapped, the
//! same collapsed rig lane and palette mirror, the same effect lane. What is new is the
//! orthographic preset, the atlas packing, and the clock: a tile samples the file at the play
//! head the ENGINE holds (decision 2007 — `UiScript::visible_model_panes`, read once per frame),
//! so the `AnimationPlayer` is paused and seeked rather than advanced, and every per-sequence
//! material track is sampled off that same cursor.
//!
//! ## The two legs in this shape
//!
//! The **orthographic** leg is the atlas's one camera: every pane on it shares that camera and its
//! layer, and its cell is where its root is placed. The **perspective** leg cannot share a camera
//! with anything — the projection and the view are the pane's own — so a perspective pane takes a
//! slot of a small pool ([`UI_MODEL_CAM_LAYERS`]) and gets a camera whose **viewport is its cell of
//! the same atlas** and whose layer is its own. That is the reference's own structure: one target,
//! one viewport per widget, depth cleared per widget. The orthographic camera runs first and is
//! the one that CLEARS the atlas; the perspective cameras load into it and clear only depth. And
//! because the perspective root sits in model space rather than at a cell, each of those cameras
//! needs a layer of its own or it would draw every other perspective pane over its own cell.
//!
//! ## What a tile's light is
//!
//! `<Model>`'s embedded light is DISABLED (§5.2), and a LIT batch under no light renders black —
//! which never shows on the shipped UI M2s because all of them are unlit, and which is the
//! faithful answer for an addon's lit one. So the DEFAULT tile light buffer is a black light (no
//! ambient, no diffuse, fog off) and unlit batches bypass it.
//!
//! A pane that arms one — `SetLight(1, …)`, or fog through `SetFogColor` — takes a slot of the
//! light pool instead ([`TileRig`]): its own buffer, its own material twins, its scene folded the
//! way the reference's collector folds it (a directional light into probe slot 0's SH, a point
//! light into the point table, the fog into rows 4/5 with the batch's authored `UNFOGGED` bit left
//! to do its own work). Nothing in the shipped interface arms either, so the pool normally holds
//! exactly the one buffer the tiles have always had.
//!
//! ## Texture transforms (decision 2019)
//!
//! A batch whose texture transform animates gets a material of its own per tile — a clone of
//! the twin with two mat-anim rows: the translation delta (the world's lane, `anim_slots.x`)
//! and the **affine** row (`anim_slots.z`: rotation and scale as deltas from the identity), both
//! sampled here off the pane's play head at the sequence's file slot, never off the world clock.
//! The shader composes them as the reference does — `uv' = R((uv + t − p) ⊙ s) + p` — which is
//! how the cooldown indicator's four quadrant quads turn their mask into the clockwise sweep.
//!
//! ## What a pane that stops drawing costs: nothing (decision 2046)
//!
//! A pane that leaves the engine's paint list keeps its tile for [`TILE_LINGER_FRAMES`] so a
//! cooldown that re-arms every few seconds, a ping, or a bag that reopens keeps its tree — but
//! the tree has to cost NOTHING while it waits, and hiding the root was never enough. Two of a
//! tile's three per-frame costs do not travel down the scene graph at all: an emitter entity is
//! a world root the particle lane walks directly, and the global-sequence bone channels are
//! written by a driver that reads no `Visibility`. So a hidden tile is **parked**, explicitly,
//! on the frame it stops drawing — [`AnimParked`] on the root (which holds the pose evaluation,
//! the compose, the palette write and the global-sequence writes) and
//! `ParticleEmitter::set_frozen` on every emitter (pool + age held, no quads).
//!
//! The emitter half is not a nicety. The particle lane's own freeze asks a CAMERA whether its
//! scene is drawn, which is exact for a booth (one camera, one scene) and cannot be asked here:
//! every orthographic pane on the sheet shares one camera, and that camera stays active whenever
//! ANY cell is packed, because it is the camera that clears the atlas. Before the park, a hidden
//! autocast-shine pane's four spline emitters kept integrating and kept pushing quads for the
//! whole linger, at the root's last-written cell — which after a repack belongs to another pane.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! - The **character panes** (`PlayerModel`/`DressUpModel`/`TabardModel`) keep their booths
//!   (`crate::portrait`): the reference frames those through raw camera 1 **frozen** at load, or
//!   a fixed fallback camera, which is a different selection and a different lifecycle from this
//!   widget's live one.
//! - A pane's fog does not reach its **particles**: the effect lane carries its own fog enum and
//!   reads its span from a render-world params uniform rather than from the light buffer, so a
//!   fogged pane's cloud draws unfogged. No shipped UI M2 with an emitter is fogged (the shine
//!   and the pings are UNFOGGED or unlit anyway), and the honest fix is on the effect lane.
