//! Area triggers — the client's half of every portal, instance entrance and "explore here" quest.
//!
//! `AreaTrigger.dbc` is a table of invisible volumes. The client's *entire* job is geometry: notice
//! that the player has walked into one, and send `CMSG_AREATRIGGER` naming its id. The **server**
//! decides what the trigger means — a teleport (`areatrigger_teleport`: the Darnassus/Rut'theran
//! portals, every dungeon and raid entrance), a quest's explore objective
//! (`areatrigger_involvedrelation`), the inn's rested state, a battleground's entrance list. The
//! client never knows and never needs to.
//!
//! Until this module existed, benilla sent that opcode from nowhere: a portal did nothing, and an
//! instance entrance did nothing, because the server was never told we were standing in one (ledger
//! **B70**, **N02**). The teleport that answers it has worked since decision 0455.
//!
//! ## The law, from the reference
//!
//! **VERIFIED** against `0x5e2110` (the per-frame check) and `0x5e22d0` (containment), wow-5875-re
//! `object-layer/scratch/w2b1-decomp.c`; the geometry itself is
//! [`AreaTriggerRow::contains`](benilla_formats::AreaTriggerRow::contains).
//!
//! - The map's rows are the only candidates (`0x5e2080` narrows the map-sorted table to a
//!   `[first, end)` window before any test).
//! - **One latch, and it is an *exit* latch.** The check holds the trigger it is currently inside;
//!   while the player is still inside *that* volume it returns immediately and sends nothing. Only
//!   once they have left does it scan for a new one — so standing in a portal fires it exactly once,
//!   and overlapping volumes never fight.
//! - The **first** containing row in file order wins.
//! - A map change clears the latch.
//!
//! Two things the reference's shape buys us, worth stating because they are load-bearing: a trigger
//! cannot re-fire while you stand in it (a portal would otherwise re-teleport you every frame), and
//! the *destination* of a portal pair is authored to land outside the return trigger (Darnassus's
//! exit lands 13.9 yd from the entrance's 10-yd sphere), so a round trip is not a loop.
//!
//! The server re-checks our claim with 5 yd of slop and ignores it while taxi-flying
//! (`HandleAreaTriggerOpcode`, vmangos `Handlers/MiscHandler.cpp:622`), so a wrong id is refused
//! rather than obeyed.
//!
//! ## ⚠ Probing this with `.go` is not the same as walking in
//!
//! A GM teleport that drops you *inside* a volume sends this message in the same millisecond as the
//! teleport ack, and the server re-checks the claim against the position it has stored — which is
//! sometimes still the pre-teleport one. Measured: five such teleport-ins were obeyed and one
//! (Darnassus's trigger 527) was silently ignored, while drifting into the same trigger under
//! movement fired it and teleported 40 ms later. So an ignored `.go` probe is the harness racing
//! the server, not this check failing — and the latch, faithfully, does not retry (it latches on
//! the *send*; the client never learns whether the server obeyed). Step out and back in, or better,
//! park outside and move in.
