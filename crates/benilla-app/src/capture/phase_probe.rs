//! `WOW_PHASE` — **what did the renderer actually do with this batch, frame by frame?**
//!
//! Every other flicker instrument we have reads the *scene*: `benilla-visual` says which pixels would
//! not hold still, `WOW_PICK` says what geometry stands at them and whether it is visible. B38
//! exhausted that layer. There, the awning is nearer than the plank behind it, writes depth, compares
//! `GreaterEqual`, is not discarded and is not culled, and keeps the same mesh, material and texture
//! on every single frame — and on half the frames the plank behind it wins the pixel anyway
//! (decisions 0662, 0665). Under those facts that is impossible, so one of them stops being true
//! somewhere *after* the scene and before the draw, and nothing we had could see into that gap.
//!
//! So: `WOW_PHASE=<uniqueId>` watches every model batch of one placed object and reports, per frame,
//! which render phase each batch landed in and **where in the draw order** it sits. Absent from every
//! phase means it was never submitted, which no amount of looking at pixels can distinguish from
//! losing a depth test. Present, but at a different position than last frame, means the draw order
//! moved — and for two surfaces that tie, draw order *is* the result.
//!
//! `WOW_PHASE_AT=<secs>` (default 20) / `WOW_PHASE_COUNT=<n>` (default 1) shape the sampling the same
//! way the screenshot burst and the ray pick do, so a phase log and a frame stack line up frame for
//! frame and "was it drawn?" can be read against "was this frame dim or bright?".
//!
//! Only the **main** 3D view's phases are read. Shadow and prepass views bin the same entities and
//! would triple every line for nothing; a defect in *those* would show up as the wrong shadow, which
//! is a different report.
