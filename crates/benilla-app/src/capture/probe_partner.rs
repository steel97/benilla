//! The partner live probe (`WOW_PROBE=partner`) — the party arc's instrument (decision 0434):
//! a second client that says YES. Once in-world it auto-accepts every group invite, so the
//! director can exercise the whole party surface — invite, roster lines, member frames,
//! leader/loot management, pings — solo, with the probe account as the other member. It also
//! accepts **duel** challenges (decision 0637), which is what makes the duel arc's two-client
//! questions answerable at all: whether the opponent turns hostile, whether the arbiter flag
//! plants. Non-combat (the unattended-combat ban, `method.md` "The local vmangos server", stands
//! untouched: this probe answers a challenge but never swings, and a duel nobody strikes in
//! simply times out). Pair with the slot-keyed probe identity (`WOW_USER=probeN …`, method.md).
