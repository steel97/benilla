//! The chest live probe (`WOW_PROBE_CHEST=1`) — **B84's instrument**: does the player kneel at an
//! open chest?
//!
//! Goudy, 2026-07-26 (`#bugs` `1530708187173359646`): *"No looting/opening animation when using a
//! chest"*, with a benilla/reference pair at the same Mirror Lake Orchard chest — the reference
//! gnome kneeling over the open loot window, ours standing bolt upright. Decision 0515 had shipped
//! the kneel keyed to the `CMSG_LOOT` send alone and recorded a chest's silence as *correct*; 1471
//! is the correction (the real client also arms the latch in `OnLootResponse 0x5eb900`, and a chest
//! never sends `CMSG_LOOT` at all).
//!
//! **A kneel is a number here, not a picture** (`method.md` step 4: timing and pose questions are
//! settled with instruments). The probe reads the self unit's own
//! [`AnimDriver::active_anim`][crate::creature_anim::AnimDriver::active_anim] — the id the base
//! selector actually landed on — so the verdict is `50` (`Loot`) or it is not, with no screenshot
//! and no eye in the loop. Three readings, in order, which is what makes it a *regression* test and
//! not a one-sided assertion:
//!
//! 1. **BEFORE** — parked at the chest, window shut: the base anim must be `0` (`Stand`). This is
//!    the control; a probe that only ever sees `50` cannot tell a fix from a stuck kneel.
//! 2. **OPEN** — the chest used on the click's own route, the loot window up: must be `50`.
//! 3. **AFTER** — `CloseLoot()` through the live VM: back to `0`.
//!
//! Nothing here re-decides what packet a chest takes. The probe resolves the object through
//! [`crate::target::click::resolve_go_action`] — the same lock chain the mouse runs (0239/0752) —
//! and sends whichever arm it names, so a chest whose `Lock.dbc` row changes shape still gets the
//! packet the real click would send. (Every world chest carries a lock: `Lock.dbc` 43 is one
//! `LockType 13 "Open Kneeling"` slot, 57 is `5 "Open"` + `6 "Treasure (DND)"`, all `Skill 0`, so
//! the "Opening" spell every character knows satisfies them and the live arm is `OpenLock`.)
//!
//! The DONE line reports the two mechanism halves separately — `latch-while-open` (predicate A: a
//! loot session is open) and `kneel-while-open` (predicate B: this *kind* of target is knelt at,
//! decision 1477). They are not the same question, and the whole of B84's correction lives in the
//! gap: a fishing bobber arms the latch exactly as a chest does and must still read `kneel=false`.
//!
//! ## The run recipe
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_NOSOUND=1 WOW_USER=probe0 WOW_PASS=pprobe0 WOW_CHAR=Probezero \
//!     WOW_PROBE_CHEST=1 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//! (the slot-keyed probe identity — `pool-N` → `probeN`/`pprobeN`/`Probe<N-spelled>`, `method.md`
//! "The local vmangos server"). `WOW_PROBE_CHEST=<x>,<y>,<z>[,<map>]` aims it at a different
//! object; the default is a live `Battered Chest` spawn (`gameobject.guid` 26756, template 2843) in
//! the Mirror Lake stretch of Elwynn, the same corner of the world the report came from. A chest is
//! a respawning spawn point: if someone emptied that one it will be missing for its respawn timer,
//! which the probe reports as a scan failure rather than as a passing run.
//!
//! Grep `PROBE_CHEST:` for the verdict; the probe self-exits when it lands.
