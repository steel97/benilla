//! `WOW_PROBE_CAM` — the scripted **camera park**: hold the third-person rig at an absolute yaw,
//! pitch and zoom so an unattended probe can *look at* a named thing (decision 0653).
//!
//! [`super::probe_look`] turns the avatar's **aim**; that is the right lever for the facing stream,
//! and the wrong one for framing a subject — it never touches `FlyCam::pitch`, which world entry
//! pins at `-0.45` rad (26° **down**). Everything above the horizon was therefore unreachable
//! headlessly: a `.go` to a pinned coordinate lands with the camera staring at the dirt, so the
//! tower / crystal / rock the report is *about* is off the top of the frame. That is why the first
//! C4 flicker burst came back clean — the subject was never in it.
//!
//! Format: `WOW_PROBE_CAM="<yaw_deg>,<pitch_deg>[,<dist_yd>]@<start_s>[:<pan_deg_per_s>][;…]"`,
//! e.g. `"180,12,25@25"` — from 25 s on, face south-ish, 12° **up**, 25 yd back. Yaw and pitch are
//! absolute (world yaw as the rig spells it, `+pitch` = up); the distance is optional and left alone
//! when omitted. Entries are held **every frame** once armed, not set once: a teleport, a settle, or
//! a wire-in reset would otherwise knock the pose off between the arm and the shot. The last armed
//! entry wins, so a `;` list is a sequence of poses.
//!
//! The optional **pan** turns the parked yaw at a constant rate from that pose's own start
//! (`"140,16,22@20:8"` — park, then sweep 8°/s). It exists because a parked camera is blind to a
//! whole class of defect: the director's read of the Far Watch Post tower is that it "mostly only
//! flickers while moving the cam, not while still" — z-fighting's signature, and precisely the
//! condition decision 0653's still burst cannot see (decision 0656). Pair it with `benilla-visual
//! flicker`'s **toggle map**, the reading that survives a moving view.
//!
//! It writes the rig fields directly for the same reason `probe_look` writes `face_yaw` directly —
//! faking mouse motion needs the OS cursor inside the viewport, which an unfocused probe window
//! cannot promise, and the camera *plumbing* is not what is under test. From these fields onward
//! this is the identical path a mouse-drag takes.
