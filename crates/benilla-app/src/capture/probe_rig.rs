//! The probe **rig** (`WOW_RIG="<spec>"`, decision 0651) — one command that puts this slot's probe
//! account into a chosen **body** and hands the session a world that is ready to test.
//!
//! ## Why it exists
//!
//! Every probe account owns one level-1 character, and every session that needs anything else has
//! been hand-assembling it out of GM commands. Mined from 507 MB of this project's own session
//! transcripts, the standing tax is: `.go xyz` 750×, `.additem` 434×, `.modify` 345×, `.gm off`
//! 257×, `.revive` **121×**, `.learn <one spell id>` a few dozen times — while
//! `.character premade` (96 ready-made BiS/twink **gear** templates plus 53 **talent** ones sitting
//! in this deploy's world DB, every class at 19/29/39/49/60) has been used **zero** times, because
//! nobody knew it was there. That is the shape of the problem: the primitives exist and are undiscoverable, so
//! each session re-derives a worse version of them.
//!
//! The rig is the one verb that hides all of it: name a body, get a body.
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_RIG="tauren druid 60 gear:heal-preraid-bis spec:heal-preraid-bis at:ThunderBluff"
//! WOW_RIG="gnome mage 39 gear:dps-39-twink gm:off"
//! WOW_RIG="60 gear:dps-preraid-bis"          # the slot's own Probe<N>, no new character
//! WOW_RIG="nightelf druid"                   # just a body of that shape, level 1
//! ```
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! **Race + class name a character, so the rig owns the pick.** vmangos has no class-change command
//! (`.character race` exists; there is no `.character class`), so a different class *is* a different
//! character — which makes creating one the honest primitive rather than a fallback. The name is
//! derived, never invented: `<Race3><Class3><slot-word>[f]`, e.g. Tauren Druid on `pool-1` →
//! `Taudruone`. Deterministic means the *next* session reuses the same body instead of littering a
//! second one, and the pattern is what makes eviction safe (below). Omit race+class and the rig
//! configures whatever `WOW_CHAR`/the slot default already logs in as.
//!
//! **The roster is a cache with an eviction policy.** `CharactersPerRealm` is 10, and there are 40
//! valid race/class pairs, so a busy account fills. The rig does not hardcode the limit: it tries
//! the create, and only on `CHAR_CREATE_SERVER_LIMIT` evicts **the rig-named character on this slot
//! that is cheapest to rebuild** — lowest level first, ties broken by oldest — then retries once.
//! Nothing outside the rig's own naming pattern is ever deleted, so `Probe<N>` and anything a human
//! made are untouchable.
//!
//! **Then it applies state, in an order that matters:** revive before anything (a ghost's commands
//! half-apply), level before gear (`ApplyPremadeGearTemplateToPlayer` only levels *up*, never
//! down), spells after level, teleport last (so a fixup lands where you asked, not where you were).
//! It always revives a dead or ghost body, whether or not you asked — that is the 121× command, and
//! there is no session that wants to keep testing on a corpse.
//!
//! ## The GM verbs behind it (all verified against `/Users/sam/wre/vmangos-src`)
//!
//! | rig token | command | needs | note |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | (always, if dead) | `.revive` | SEC_GAMEMASTER 3 | |
//! | `<level>` | `.character level N` | SEC_DEVELOPER 5 | no name arg ⇒ self |
//! | (with a level) | `.learn all_myclass` | SEC_DEVELOPER 5 | = all class spells **+** all talents |
//! | `gear:<t>` | `.character premade gear <t>` | SEC_BASIC_ADMIN 4 | name or entry; levels up + equips |
//! | `spec:<t>` | `.character premade spec <t>` | SEC_BASIC_ADMIN 4 | resets talents, learns the tree |
//! | `at:<name>` | `.tele <name>` | SEC_TICKETMASTER 2 | 997 named rows in `game_tele` |
//! | `at:m,x,y,z` | `.go xyz x y z m` | SEC_TICKETMASTER 2 | |
//! | `gm:on\|off` | `.gm on\|off` | SEC_GAMEMASTER 3 | see 0649 on why `off` matters |
//!
//! Probe accounts are gmlevel **6**, so every one of these lands. Pass `gear:?` (or `spec:?`) to
//! make the server *list* the templates its class has instead of applying one — the discovery path,
//! since the catalog lives in the world DB and not in any client data.
//!
//! **Two things about `gear:` that have each cost a session.** First, the templates are not all full
//! sets: of the 96 in this deploy, `pvp-r14-hunter-fx` holds 5 items and the priest/warrior
//! `heal-r14`/`tank-r14` hold 8, against a 16.8 mean — so a sparse body can be exactly what the
//! template says, and only a body under `GEAR_FLOOR` is evidence of a refusal. Second, applying gear
//! **strips before it dresses** (`ApplyPremadeGearTemplateToPlayer` unequips all 19 slots, then
//! `StoreNewItemInBestSlots` per item), so re-dressing a body leaves the old copy in its bags and
//! mails the overflow once they fill. Repeated rigs on one character accumulate; a fresh rig-named
//! character (give `WOW_RIG` a race+class) starts with empty bags and is the cheaper path.
//!
//! Non-combat throughout: the rig creates, configures, places and stops. It never fights, so the
//! unattended-combat ban (method.md) is untouched.
