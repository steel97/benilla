//! The auction-arc live probe (`WOW_PROBE_AUCTION=1`) — decision 1511's end-to-end instrument:
//! GM-hop to a real Stormwind auctioneer, greet it on the wire, and drive browse / throttle /
//! sell / owner-list / cancel through the **live Lua VM** exactly as a click would, printing a
//! `PROBE_AUCTION:` trace line with a PASS/FAIL/SKIP verdict per step and a final
//! `PROBE_AUCTION: DONE pass=<n> fail=<m>` summary. Modeled closely on [`super::probe_mail`]
//! (same phase-machine shape, same trace style, same self-terminating exit).
//!
//! ## The one assertion no unit test can make
//!
//! Step (2). **The window is opened by the server, not by the click** ([`crate::ui_auction`]):
//! `MSG_AUCTION_HELLO` goes out and nothing happens; the *reply* — the same opcode coming back
//! with the auctioneer guid and an `AuctionHouse.dbc` house id — opens the session and fires
//! `AUCTION_HOUSE_SHOW`. Every other piece of this arc is downstream of that reply arriving, so it
//! is the step this probe exists for. The house id is checked to be in `1..=7` because it keys the
//! deposit rate the sell pane quotes, and a zero would silently quote a free listing.
//!
//! ## The auctioneer (live-DB verified this session, `/Users/sam/dev/vmangos-deploy` → `mangos`)
//!
//! Auctioneer Fitch, creature entry 8719, spawn guid 12696, map 0 (Stormwind, Trade District),
//! pos `(-8821.53, 659.886, 97.4645)`. Her `creature_template.npc_flags` is **4096** exactly —
//! bit 12 only (`UNIT_NPC_FLAG_AUCTIONEER`), no gossip bit — so the right-click route sends
//! `AuctionHello` directly with no gossip pre-empt (`target::click::interact_command`'s own note
//! on the service ladder), which is precisely the command this probe sends.
//!
//! ## What the server does that shapes the phases (VERIFIED, vmangos `AuctionHouseHandler.cpp`)
//!
//! - **One AH list request at a time.** `HandleAuctionListItems`/`ListOwnerItems`/`ListBidderItems`
//!   all open with `if (ReceivedAHListRequest()) return;` — a second query while one is in flight
//!   is dropped *silently*. Every list phase here therefore waits for its answer before asking
//!   again, and the owner phase re-asks on a timer rather than spamming.
//! - **`etime` is minutes on the wire**, converted server-side (`etime * MINUTE`) and switched
//!   against 1/4/12 × `MIN_AUCTION_TIME` (2 h). 120 is the shortest legal listing.
//! - **The deposit** is `uint32(SellPrice × count × (etime / MIN_AUCTION_TIME) × depositPercent /
//!   100)` (`AuctionHouseMgr::GetAuctionDeposit`), with `Auction.Deposit.Min = 0` and
//!   `Rate.Auction.Deposit = 1` in this deploy's `mangosd.conf`. At **120 minutes the unit count
//!   is 1**, which is exactly where the client's own arithmetic (`CalculateAuctionDeposit`, whose
//!   intermediate truncation disagrees with the server on longer listings — decision 1511 §7) and
//!   the server's agree to the copper. That is why step (5) lists for 120 minutes: it makes "money
//!   fell by exactly the quoted deposit" a real assertion instead of a flaky one.
//! - **A cancel with no bidder is free** and returns the item **by mail**, not to the bag
//!   (`HandleAuctionRemoveItem`) — so a clean run leaves the auction house as it found it and one
//!   letter in the probe's own mailbox. Vanilla's behaviour, not litter we could avoid.
//! - `GM.AllowTrades = 1` in this deploy, so the gmlevel-6 probe accounts are not refused with
//!   `AUCTION_ERR_RESTRICTED_ACCOUNT` (the guard at the top of `HandleAuctionSellItem`).
//!
//! ## The row-identity rule this probe obeys
//!
//! [`super::probe_mail`]'s header records the defect worth not repeating: a probe that re-finds
//! its row **by predicate** each tick reads its own success as absence, because a successful
//! action is exactly what stops the row matching. So the auction created in step (5) is
//! remembered by the **auction id the server's own `STARTED` result carried**, once, and every
//! later step tracks that id — never "the row whose item is Linen Cloth".
//!
//! ## The run recipe
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_PROBE_AUCTION=1 WOW_NOSOUND=1 WOW_USER=probe5 WOW_PASS=pprobe5 WOW_CHAR=Probefive \
//!     cargo run -p benilla
//! ```
//! (the slot-keyed probe identity — `pool-N` → `WOW_USER=probeN WOW_PASS=pprobeN
//! WOW_CHAR=Probe<N-spelled>`, method.md "The local vmangos server"; this worktree is `pool-5`).
//! Non-combat. An outer grep on `PROBE_AUCTION:` is the whole harness; the probe self-exits (the
//! [`super::probes::ProbeExitPlugin`] pattern) once DONE.
