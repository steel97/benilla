//! The guild-charter live probe (`WOW_PROBE_CHARTER=1`) — decision 1672's end-to-end instrument:
//! log in, GM-hop to the Stormwind guild registrar, open his gossip menu on the real wire, assert
//! the charter row's icon reads **petition**, select it by its wire index, buy a charter through
//! the registrar's own window, right-click the charter in the bags the way a player does, watch the
//! petition window fill in a round trip later, rename it, and destroy it again so the next run can
//! do the same. One `PROBE_CHARTER: <step> PASS/FAIL/SKIP <detail>` line per step, then a final
//! `PROBE_CHARTER: DONE pass=<n> fail=<m>`. Modeled closely on [`super::probe_binder`] — same phase
//! machine, same trace style, same self-terminating exit ([`super::probes::ProbeExitPlugin`]'s
//! pattern), same live-VM observation idiom (`script.eval` against the real UI VM) — with
//! [`super::probe_clam`]'s bag-click leg (`UseContainerItem` through the live VM, so the real
//! dispatcher runs) and its watch-the-cleanup-land exit.
//!
//! **Unit tests cannot reach any of this.** Every claim the charter slice rests on is about what a
//! real server sends and in what order: a packet that had no const and no parse arm until 1672
//! landed, a window that deliberately opens *empty* and fills a round trip later, and an item-use
//! fork arm whose whole evidence is "no other arm accepts a charter". Those are only visible
//! against real bytes.
//!
//! ## The registrar (live-DB verified this session, `/Users/sam/dev/vmangos-deploy` → `mangos` DB)
//!
//! Aldwin Laughlin, the Stormwind guild registrar — `creature_template.entry = 4974`, spawn
//! `creature.guid = 79681`, **map 0**, position `(-8885.25, 614.395, 95.2576)`,
//! `creature_template.npc_flags = 1537` = `0x601` = GOSSIP | **PETITIONER (0x200)** |
//! TABARDDESIGNER (0x400), `gossip_menu_id = 708`. Both of the top two bits matter: vmangos's
//! buy handler fetches the NPC with `GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(guid, UNIT_NPC_FLAG_PETITIONER)` and
//! then *also* refuses anything that is not `IsTabardDesigner()`
//! (`Handlers/PetitionsHandler.cpp:44-52`), so a petitioner without the tabard bit sells nothing.
//!
//! **`UNIT_NPC_FLAG_PETITIONER` is `0x200`** (vmangos `Objects/UnitDefines.h:666`). The probe
//! reuses [`crate::target::cursor_mode::npc_flags::PETITIONER`] rather than keeping a second copy
//! — a duplicated flag table is exactly how B249's icon map went stale.
//!
//! ## The charter row (live-DB verified this session)
//!
//! `gossip_menu_option` for menu 708 carries **exactly two rows, both unconditional**
//! (`condition_id = 0`), so a GM probe and a player see the same two — unlike the innkeeper menu
//! [`super::probe_binder`] walks, where GM mode adds holiday rows:
//!
//! | wire index | `option_icon` | `option_id`                    | text                            |
//! |------------|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
//! | 0          | **7**         | 10 (`GOSSIP_OPTION_PETITIONER`)| *"How do I form a guild?"*      |
//! | 1          | 8             | 11 (tabard designer)           | *"I want to create a guild crest."* |
//!
//! Icon byte **7** is `"petition"` in [`crate::ui_gossip`]'s `GOSSIP_ICON_TYPES` — the client's own
//! `0x84b7ac` table, byte-verified in decision 1335. The probe finds the row **by that icon byte
//! and selects by the row's wire index, never by list position**: that is the lesson
//! [`super::probe_binder`]'s header records, and it is why this probe survives a menu that grows a
//! row. The label guard is a lowercase substring for the same file's other lesson — vmangos
//! prefers `option_broadcast_text` (3413) over the `option_text` column, so an equality test would
//! be asserting which of two copies of the same sentence the server happened to pick.
//!
//! ## The charter item and its price (live-DB + vmangos source, verified this session)
//!
//! Entry **5863** "Guild Charter", `display_id = 16161`, `flags = 8192` (`0x2000` =
//! `ITEM_FLAG_CHARTER`), `max_count = 1`, `inventory_type = 0`, `start_quest = 0`, `page_text = 0`,
//! **no ON_USE spell** and not LOOTABLE. That combination is the whole of
//! [`crate::ui_items::ItemUseRoute::ShowPetition`]'s evidence: every other arm of the item-use fork
//! declines a charter, so before 1672 a right-click reached `Nothing` and sent nothing at all.
//!
//! The price is **1000 copper** (10 silver) — vmangos `GUILD_CHARTER_COST`
//! (`Handlers/PetitionsHandler.cpp:39`), which arrives in `SMSG_PETITION_SHOWLIST`'s `charterCost`
//! field and is what `GetGuildCharterCost()` must quote.
//!
//! `MAX_CHARTER_NAME` is **24** UTF-8 characters (`ObjectMgr.h:401`, enforced by
//! `ObjectMgr::IsValidCharterName`, which allows digits and spaces —
//! `isValidString(…, numericOrSpace = true)`). The probe's names are 22 characters.
//!
//! ## What each step can and cannot conclude
//!
//! | step | what a FAIL there means | `ui_petition` claim it bears on |
//! |------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
//! | 0 | the probe left a guild behind and `GuildLeave`/`GuildDisband` did not take — every later step is meaningless, because a buy is refused **silently** while guilded | — (re-runnability) |
//! | 1 | environmental: the `.go` was refused or Stormwind never streamed — SKIP, not a defect | — |
//! | 2 | the gossip wire or the B292 text-query hold is broken for this NPC | — |
//! | 3 | the icon table regressed one row over from B249: byte 7 must read `"petition"` | — |
//! | 4 | `SMSG_PETITION_SHOWLIST` is not parsed, does not fire `GUILD_REGISTRAR_SHOW`, or its `charterCost` is not what `GetGuildCharterCost()` reads | **INFERRED #1**, and `script::petition`'s "what `GetGuildCharterCost` reads" |
//! | 5 | the buy never reached the server, or was refused — there is **no confirmation packet at all**, so the item arriving *is* the answer | — |
//! | 6 | using a charter does not open the petition window: either the fork arm or `SMSG_PETITION_SHOW_SIGNATURES` → `PETITION_SHOW` | **INFERRED #6**, and **#2** |
//! | 7 | the lazy record fill is broken — the window would sit titleless forever, which is the whole two-caches design | `script::petition`'s "the repaint path" |
//! | 8 | `MSG_PETITION_RENAME`'s echo does not patch the cached record (the echo is sent **only on success**) | — |
//! | 9 | the charter is still in the bags, and the **next** run's buy will be refused silently for "the owner already has one" (`PetitionsHandler.cpp:70`) — a failure that looks nothing like its cause | — (re-runnability) |
//!
//! Three of `ui_petition`'s six INFERRED claims are **not** touched here, and none of the three is
//! an oversight. #4 (re-asking for the signature list on an `OK` sign result) needs a second
//! account to sign, and #5 (`ERR_GUILD_FOUNDER_S` on a successful turn-in) needs nine of them —
//! neither is reachable from one client, so the whole sign/offer/turn-in half of the family
//! (`SignPetition`, `OfferPetition`, `TurnInGuildCharter`, `MSG_PETITION_DECLINE`) still has no
//! live coverage after this probe. #3 (the two closes send nothing) is *superseded*: the wow-re
//! carve that landed alongside this file finds that closing a charter you do NOT own can send
//! `MSG_PETITION_DECLINE`, so this probe deliberately asserts nothing about either close rather
//! than pinning a claim that is being rewritten.
//!
//! ## The run recipe
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_NOSOUND=1 WOW_USER=probe0 WOW_PASS=pprobe0 WOW_CHAR=Probezero \
//!     WOW_PROBE_CHARTER=1 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//! (the slot-keyed probe identity — this worktree is `pool-0` → `probe0`/`pprobe0`/`Probezero`;
//! method.md "The local vmangos server". **Never the default `one` account** — a login on it kicks
//! the director's live session.) `WOW_NOSOUND=1` because an unattended probe must not play zone
//! music into the director's room; `caffeinate -dis` is **not** needed for a run this short — the
//! whole sequence is a handful of round trips and finishes in well under a minute.
//!
//! Non-combat: this probe never fights and never targets anything. GM mode is left exactly as
//! found. An outer `timeout` + grep on `PROBE_CHARTER:` is the whole harness; the probe self-exits
//! once DONE, and every wait is bounded — a hung leg FAILs with a legible detail rather than
//! hanging the run.
