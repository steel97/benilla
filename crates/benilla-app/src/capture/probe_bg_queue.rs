//! The battleground-queue live probe (`WOW_PROBE_BGQUEUE=1`) — the instrument that makes
//! "**log in while queued for a battleground**" a shape anyone can reproduce, inert without the
//! env.
//!
//! Decision 2232 audited the 29 drains that could still lose a login burst and argued this one
//! safe on paper: `SMSG_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS` is published as `UPDATE_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS` off a
//! `mem::take` latch that no `VmMemo` re-arms, so a message consumed in 2214's one-frame window
//! is gone — but [`crate::ui_battlefield::reset_on_world_enter`] re-sends
//! `CMSG_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS` on entry and the server answers slot by slot, so the queue heals
//! itself. That record named the argument **unexercised**, and the reason it stayed unexercised
//! is that the setup is three server-side gates deep, not that nobody thought to look.
//!
//! So: level past the bracket floor, GM-hop to the Stormwind Warsong Gulch battlemaster, greet
//! him on the real wire (`CMSG_BATTLEMASTER_HELLO` → `SMSG_BATTLEFIELD_LIST`), queue through the
//! guid that list carried (`CMSG_BATTLEMASTER_JOIN`), and report the slot the server put us in.
//! The probe then **leaves the body queued** — vmangos keeps the queue entry across a logout
//! (`BattleGroundQueue::PlayerLoggedOut` only marks it offline) and re-sends the status from
//! `Player::LoadFromDB`, i.e. inside the login burst. The NEXT plain login is the measurement;
//! this run is its fixture.
//!
//! **Why the guid and not `CMSG_BATTLEFIELD_JOIN`.** vmangos routes the bodyless join through
//! `RequestBgJoinQueue(ObjectGuid{}, …)`, whose `GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(battlemaster,
//! UNIT_NPC_FLAG_BATTLEMASTER)` cannot resolve an empty guid — it logs an anticheat line and
//! returns, silently. Only the battlemaster leg queues anyone, which is why this probe has to
//! stand next to one.
//!
//! **The undo is one line**, and it belongs here rather than in whatever record cites the probe:
//! the body stays queued until something dequeues it, so leave it clean with
//! `WOW_PROBE_LUA='AcceptBattlefieldPort(1,0)'` on a plain login — `GetBattlefieldStatus(1)` then
//! answers `none`. A body left queued is not harmful, only surprising: every later login on that
//! account carries an extra `SMSG_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS` in its burst.
//!
//! Non-combat. Pair with the SLOT-KEYED probe identity (`WOW_USER=probeN WOW_PASS=pprobeN
//! WOW_CHAR=Probe<N-spelled>`; `method.md`, "The local vmangos server"), and `WOW_NOSOUND=1` when
//! it runs unattended. One `timeout`'d run plus a grep for `PROBE bgqueue:` is the whole harness.
