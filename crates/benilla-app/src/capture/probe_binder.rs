//! The innkeeper-bind live probe (`WOW_PROBE_BINDER=1`) — decision 1331's end-to-end instrument and
//! the evidence that closes **B249** ("setting your Hearthstone shows a wrong icon and doesn't
//! take"): log in, GM-hop to the exact innkeeper in the bug's screenshot, open her gossip menu on
//! the real wire, assert the bind row's icon reads **binder** (half 1), select it, assert the
//! server's `SMSG_BINDER_CONFIRM` arrived and reached the Lua dialog (half 2's question), answer it
//! through the reference's own `ConfirmBinder()`, and assert the hearthstone actually moved (half
//! 2's answer). One `PROBE_BINDER: <step> PASS/FAIL/SKIP <detail>` line per step, then a final
//! `PROBE_BINDER: DONE pass=<n> fail=<m>`. Modeled closely on [`super::probe_bank`] — same phase
//! machine, same trace style, same self-terminating exit ([`super::probes::ProbeExitPlugin`]'s
//! pattern), same live-VM observation idiom (a small Lua hook appending to a probe table, read back
//! with `script.eval`).
//!
//! Unit tests cannot close B249. Half 1's old mapping was self-consistent (it just described a
//! *later* client's icon art), and half 2's packet was never parsed at all — both defects are only
//! visible against a real server sending real bytes, which is what this probe puts in front of
//! them.
//!
//! ## The innkeeper (live-DB verified this session, `/Users/sam/dev/vmangos-deploy` → `mangos` DB)
//!
//! Innkeeper Keldamyr — `creature_template.entry = 6736`, spawn `creature.guid = 46343`, **map 1**
//! (Teldrassil, Dolanaar), position `(9802.21, 982.608, 1313.98)`,
//! `creature_template.npc_flags = 135` = `0x87` = GOSSIP|QUESTGIVER|VENDOR|**INNKEEPER**,
//! `gossip_menu_id = 1293`. She is the NPC in the bug's screenshot, which is why the probe hops to
//! her rather than to whichever innkeeper is nearest.
//!
//! **`UNIT_NPC_FLAG_INNKEEPER` is `0x80` (128) on 1.12** — vmangos `Objects/UnitDefines.h:610`,
//! read this session. `GossipDef.h:45`'s comment beside `GOSSIP_OPTION_INNKEEPER` says `(65536)`,
//! which is a *later* client's value for the same flag: exactly the stale-comment trap decision
//! 1331 is about (half 1 was a hand-written icon map that trusted that same header's enum *names*).
//! [`NPC_FLAG_INNKEEPER`] below is the verified `0x80`, and it is only the scan's fallback — the
//! primary identity check is the template entry.
//!
//! ## The bind row (live-DB verified this session)
//!
//! `gossip_menu_option` for menu 1293 carries five rows; the innkeeper's is
//! `option_icon = 5`, `option_id = 8` (`GOSSIP_OPTION_INNKEEPER`), `npc_option_npcflag = 128`,
//! text *"Make this inn my home."* — and **every one of the 21 `option_id = 8` rows in the whole
//! world DB uses `option_icon = 5`** (`SELECT option_icon, COUNT(*) … WHERE option_id = 8 GROUP BY
//! option_icon` → a single row, `5 | 21`). So icon 5 is *the* innkeeper icon, and 5 was precisely
//! the byte the pre-1331 map had no entry for: it fell through to the chat bubble. Step 3 FAILs
//! loudly on `"gossip"` for that reason — that string is the B249 regression itself.
//!
//! Two things a live reading shows that the DB row does not, both verified on the first run:
//!
//! - **The label on the wire is not `option_text`.** vmangos prefers the row's
//!   `option_broadcast_text` (2822 -> *"Make this inn your home."*) over the `option_text` column
//!   (*"Make this inn **my** home."*). Step 4's guard is therefore a lowercase `"home"` substring,
//!   not an equality — the exact wording is the server's to choose.
//! - **A probe login sees five rows here, not the three in the bug's screenshot.** GM mode is the
//!   probe default (decision 0679; the preflight banner says so every run), and vmangos does not
//!   condition-filter a GM's menu — it appends `"(GM mode is ON)"` to the two holiday rows and
//!   sends them anyway. So the bind row sits at list position 2 with wire index 1 on a probe, and
//!   would sit at position 1 on a player. That is exactly why step 3 finds the row by its **wire
//!   icon byte** and step 4 selects by its **wire index**, and why neither ever counts positions.
//!
//! ## What each step can and cannot conclude
//!
//! Step 5 is the load-bearing one. Before 1331 `SMSG_BINDER_CONFIRM` (0x2eb) had no const, no parse
//! arm and no dialog: it fell through `parse.rs`'s tail into `ServerPacket::Other` and the click
//! produced a closing gossip window and nothing else. A PASS there means the packet is parsed, the
//! session state took it, and the `CONFIRM_BINDER` event reached the live VM carrying a real area
//! name.
//!
//! Step 6 answers it the way a player does — `ConfirmBinder()` run in the live VM, so the whole
//! dialog→engine→drain→wire chain (`CMSG_BINDER_ACTIVATE`, 0x1b5) is exercised rather than a
//! synthesized packet. **A rebind to the place you are already bound is invisible unless you make
//! it visible**: vmangos's `EffectBind` (`SpellEffects.cpp`) writes the homebind and sends
//! `SMSG_BINDPOINTUPDATE` *unconditionally*, but our [`HomeBind`] would simply be re-set to the
//! value it already held. So the probe clears `HomeBind` to `None` immediately before answering
//! and waits for it to become `Some` again — that transition is the fresh packet, and it is the
//! only reading that survives a probe character who already hearths in Dolanaar from an earlier
//! run.
//!
//! ## The run recipe
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_DATA=WoW/Data WOW_USER=probe1 WOW_PASS=pprobe1 WOW_CHAR=Probeone \
//!     WOW_PROBE_BINDER=1 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//! (the slot-keyed probe identity — this worktree is `pool-1` → `probe1`/`pprobe1`/`Probeone`;
//! method.md "The local vmangos server"). Non-combat, and GM mode is left exactly as found. An
//! outer `timeout` + grep on `PROBE_BINDER:` is the whole harness; the probe self-exits once DONE.
//!
//! Every step SKIPs with a note rather than FAILing for an environmental problem (the NPC never
//! streamed, a GM command refused, no UI VM in this build). A genuine wrong value is a FAIL.
