//! The probe fleet's **environment registry** — every `WOW_PROBE*` variable the app reads, in one
//! table the code is checked against in both directions (decision 2265 §A5).
//!
//! The set used to live in three places that could not see each other: the read sites (one per
//! variable, spread over the fleet), a hand-kept arming list in `dev.rs` for the un-occludable
//! window ([`super::ProbeFocusPlugin`], decision 0906), and nothing at all that said what the
//! fleet accepts. The arming list is the one that bit: 0906's rule is that *every* scripted
//! probe defends itself against the macOS occlusion throttle, and the list had drifted to ten of
//! the twenty-five variables that schedule on the wall clock — a mail or auction probe launched
//! exactly as the method prescribes ran covered, at ~1 fps, measuring garbage.
//!
//! So the list is now a **column** here ([`ProbeVar::wall_clock`]), the arming reads the column,
//! and two structural tests below keep the table honest: every `"WOW_PROBE…"` string literal in
//! the crate is a row, every row is a literal somewhere other than this file, and every value
//! `WOW_PROBE` itself dispatches on is in [`PROBE_NAMES`]. `WOW_PROBE=list` prints it.
//!
//! What this is **not**: a dispatcher. The variables keep their own read sites and their own
//! shapes — several carry free-form values (Lua chunks, chat lines with spaces and `=`, `A>B`
//! drag specs) and several combine in one run — so folding them into one variable would need an
//! escaping mini-language and would change the launch line every session uses. The defect was
//! the drift, and a registry is the whole cure for drift.
