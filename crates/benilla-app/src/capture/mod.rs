//! Deterministic capture mode — the machine half of the Phase-5 visual A/B harness (decision 0008).
//!
//! With `$WOW_CAPTURE=<scenario>` set, the app boots server-less (net disabled in `main`), pins the
//! game-clock and the camera to a named viewpoint, waits for the rendered image to stop changing,
//! writes one PNG of the primary window to `$WOW_CAPTURE_OUT`, and exits. The render rework (decision 0008) is the
//! single riskiest change in the architecture — it can regress the whole look at once — so it goes
//! behind this harness: baselines are captured on the *current* pipeline, then every rework step is
//! diffed against them by the `benilla-visual` tool, catching regressions by machine before the
//! director's eye. Driven by `scripts/visual.sh`.
//!
//! Captures contain Blizzard-derived imagery (rendered terrain/models), so they live under the
//! gitignored `target/visual/` and are never committed.
//!
//! ## What makes a capture reproducible — two mechanisms, and that is all
//! "Deterministic" is the whole claim: a golden diff is evidence only if two runs of one unchanged
//! build agree. Pinning the camera, the game clock and the clutter seed is not enough.
//!
//! 1. **The shutter waits for the IMAGE to stop changing** ([`STABLE_FRAMES`], [`FrameWatch`],
//!    decision 0815). The scene is built when the rendered frame stops moving — measured, by reading
//!    the framebuffer back and comparing bytes. This replaced four *proxies* for the same question
//!    (tile residency, `scene_ready`, outstanding placements, and a world-entity-count quiescence
//!    counter), each of which was partial by construction and each of which had been added after the
//!    previous one was caught missing something. Streaming, pipeline warm-up, late placements, late
//!    M2 loads and the loading-screen fade are all *visible in the frame* — or they do not affect the
//!    shot, in which case they were never the harness's business.
//! 2. **The game clock is frozen** ([`CAPTURE_FRAME_DT`], [`hold_clock`], decision 0723), because the
//!    sims integrate in *seconds* while the harness counts *frames*. Held while the scene is being
//!    built, then released for exactly [`age_frames`] fixed steps, so the shot's sim age is the same
//!    duration on any machine.
//!
//! **Neither one fixes the known residual flake, and no gate here can.** `scripts/visual.sh
//! selfcheck` still finds a small number of scenarios that land in one of exactly two states. The
//! cause is not timing: it is that our draw order among *coplanar, equal-depth* batches follows spawn
//! order, and spawn order varies because asset loads complete on a thread pool (0723's Open section,
//! reached again by 0810 and 0815). Both states are perfectly stable — so waiting longer, waiting for
//! quiescence, or waiting for pixel stability cannot help. It is a renderer defect that the harness
//! correctly *reports*; do not try to gate it away here. Read 0815 before touching this file's phases.
//!
//! ## Running one capture by hand
//! **Run through Cargo — never the built binary directly:**
//! ```text
//! WOW_CAPTURE_UI=1 WOW_CAPTURE=ui-unitframes \
//!     WOW_CAPTURE_OUT=/tmp/shot.png cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//! (`WOW_DATA` is only needed for a non-standard install — the client finds one in the project
//! folder or beside the binary on its own, `benilla_formats::wow_data`, decision 1175.)
//!
//! `cargo run` rebuilds first; a bare `target/debug/benilla` can silently be **stale code** — the
//! classic way a capture "disproves" a fix that was never in the binary. Staleness is now the
//! *only* trap here, and this note is worth keeping for why. Before 0993, `assets/` resolved
//! through Cargo's runtime `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, so a bare run loaded **no** WGSL at all and every
//! custom-shader layer — the entire player UI, sky, liquid, models — rendered blank; it was read
//! as a UI bug for hours once. 0993 patched that by baking an absolute source-tree path in at
//! compile time, which fixed the capture and left a binary that worked only on the machine that
//! built it. 1175 deleted the path instead: every shader is compiled into the binary and addressed
//! `embedded://<crate>/shaders/…`, so there is no asset root left to resolve wrongly.
//! `WOW_CAPTURE_UI=1` opts the player UI into the shot (off
//! by default so world baselines stay UI-free; omit it for world-only scenes). `WOW_CAPTURE=list`
//! prints the scenario names. `scripts/visual.sh` wraps all of this.
