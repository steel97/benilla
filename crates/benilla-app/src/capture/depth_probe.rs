//! `WOW_DEPTH` — **what depth actually won this pixel, and how far away is it?**
//!
//! The last unread link in B38. There, two surfaces of the Far Watch Post tower trade places: the
//! awning is nearer, writes depth, compares `GreaterEqual`, is not discarded, is not culled, keeps
//! the same mesh/material/texture every frame, and is submitted into `AlphaMask3d` at a stable draw
//! position on every single frame (decisions 0662, 0665, 0667) — and on some frames the plank behind
//! it wins the pixel anyway. Every one of those facts was established on the **CPU** side. None of
//! them says what value the GPU wrote into the depth buffer, which is the one thing that decides the
//! pixel and the one thing we could not read.
//!
//! So: `WOW_DEPTH="<x>,<y>[;<x>,<y>…]"` copies the view's depth texture back after the main pass and
//! logs, per frame, the raw reverse-Z value at each pixel and **where that puts the surface** — both
//! as a distance along the pixel's ray and as the perpendicular distance to the camera plane, because
//! those are different numbers and only the first is comparable with a ray cast.
//! `WOW_DEPTH_AT=<secs>` (default 20) / `WOW_DEPTH_COUNT=<n>` (default 1) shape the sampling like the
//! screenshot burst and the ray pick, so the three line up frame for frame.
//!
//! **Run it together with `WOW_PICK` at the same pixels.** This probe answers *what depth won*; the
//! ray pick answers *what is standing there* — every hit along the ray with its distance. Reading the
//! won distance against the hit distances is what turns a number into "**whose** depth won": if a
//! frame's depth matches hit 1's distance rather than hit 0's, the nearer surface never wrote depth
//! there, and no argument about draw order or culling survives that. Splitting the two keeps each
//! probe single-purpose, and because the geometry is static the pick's distances hold across the
//! whole burst.
//!
//! Coordinates are **screenshot pixels** — the same space `benilla-visual` reports boxes in and
//! `WOW_PICK` takes — and here they are used directly, because the depth texture is allocated in
//! physical pixels. (`WOW_PICK` has to divide by the window scale factor; its ray cast works in
//! logical units. Same input space, different reason.)
//!
//! ## `WOW_DEPTH_QUADS` — the same reading, taken at a particle quad's OWN pixels
//!
//! A hand-written pixel list is the wrong instrument for a *moving* subject. B16's eye glow is two
//! additive quads a few dozen pixels across, riding an animated bone: name a pixel and by the frame
//! the readback lands the quad is somewhere else, and a grid coarse enough to catch it samples the
//! head, the ground and the neighbouring unit instead (that mis-measurement is retracted).
//!
//! `WOW_DEPTH_QUADS=<bone>[,<bone>…]` (empty value = every quad emitter) reads the emitter's **live
//! vertex buffer** — the four corners `expand_quads` actually wrote, the ones the GPU is about to
//! rasterize — projects them with the frame's own matrices, and samples the depth buffer on a
//! bilinear grid *inside that quad*. What comes back is the number the offline model predicts and
//! the reference measures: the **surviving area fraction** of the quad under `GreaterEqual`, plus
//! how deep the winning surface sits in front of it, in yards. No camera hunting, no pixel guessing,
//! and no way to accidentally measure a different surface.
//!
//! Frames with no live quad are skipped entirely (no copy, no frame counted), so the burst lands on
//! the frames where the subject exists rather than on a wall clock.
//!
//! **MSAA must be off** (`WOW_MSAA=off`). A multisampled depth texture cannot be copied to a buffer
//! at all, and there is no single "the" depth at a pixel to report if it could — there are four. The
//! probe refuses rather than reporting one of them, because a number that looks like the measurement
//! you wanted, taken slightly wrong, is how this bug has already produced four confident wrong
//! answers (0667).
