//! The GameObject-questgiver live probe (`WOW_PROBE_GOQUEST=1`) — the instrument for *"wanted
//! posters and quest objects are never status-queried"*, and for the answer that question turned
//! out to have (decision 1872).
//!
//! A quest-giving **GameObject** — a wanted poster, a half-eaten body, a suspicious barrel — is a
//! questgiver on the wire exactly as a creature is, and the reference client asks about it: the
//! sweep callback tests typemask bit 5 and sends `CMSG_QUESTGIVER_STATUS_QUERY` for any GameObject
//! carrying `GAMEOBJECT_FLAGS` bit 2 whose reaction toward us is `> 1`. benilla asked about no
//! GameObject at all, which is a real wire gap.
//!
//! But **the answer is refused, and nothing is ever drawn**: the reference's handler `0x5dc9f0`
//! resolves the GUID with typemask 8, a GameObject's `0x21` misses bit 3, and the packet dies at
//! `0x5dca2f`. And the real 1.12 service never sent one anyway — zero GameObject GUIDs across the
//! 1292 in the genuine sniff corpus. **vmangos does send one** (`TYPEMASK_CREATURE_OR_GAMEOBJECT`,
//! `QuestHandler.cpp:41`), so on our server the refusal is load-bearing rather than theoretical:
//! without it a wanted poster would wear a gold `!` the reference client leaves bare.
//!
//! That makes this probe's job the three-way distinction a unit test cannot make at the real
//! object: **the query went out**, **the answer came back**, and **we refused it** — where "never
//! asked" and "asked and correctly refused" both read as an empty status map. The refusal readout
//! ([`QuestGiver::refused_for`]) is what separates them, and an arriving status can only exist if
//! our query did. It is keyed by guid on purpose: Goldshire has several quest objects in view and
//! the server answers all of them in one drain, so a single last-writer slot reads as whichever
//! object archetype order happened to put last (it read as a regression exactly once, on a run
//! where nothing about the behaviour had changed).
//!
//! Four readings, in order, and the last two are the controls that make it a regression test:
//!
//! 1. **LOW** — at level [`LOW_LEVEL`], below the quest's own `MinLevel`: the server must answer
//!    `1` (`UNAVAILABLE`, the grey `!` a *creature* would wear) and we must refuse it.
//! 2. **HIGH** — after a ding past `MinLevel`: the answer must change to `5` (`AVAILABLE`). A probe
//!    that only ever saw one value could not tell a live query from a single stale packet.
//! 3. **NO STATUS** — `QuestGiver::status()` for the poster stays `None` throughout, sampled every
//!    frame rather than at the windows. The marker layer and the minimap dot both draw from exactly
//!    that map, so an empty entry *is* "no `!`, no dot".
//! 4. **THE UNIT CONTROL** — a creature questgiver in the same scene still gets and keeps its own
//!    status. This is the half that must not change, and it is what would catch a refusal written
//!    one bit too wide.
//!
//! ## The run recipe
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_NOSOUND=1 WOW_USER=probe4 WOW_PASS=pprobe4 WOW_CHAR=Probefour \
//!     WOW_PROBE_GOQUEST=1 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//! (the slot-keyed probe identity — `pool-N` → `probeN`/`pprobeN`/`Probe<N-spelled>`, `method.md`
//! "The local vmangos server"). `WOW_PROBE_GOQUEST=<x>,<y>,<z>[,<map>]` aims it elsewhere; the
//! default is the **Goldshire wanted poster** — `gameobject.guid` 26843, template 68
//! `Wanted Poster`, `type` 2 `GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_QUESTGIVER`, `flags` 4 `INTERACT_COND`, offering
//! quest 176 `Wanted: "Hogger"` (`MinLevel` 5, `QuestLevel` 11). It is a single **unpooled** spawn
//! with a 900 s respawn, so it is there every run — unlike the chest probe's first target, which
//! was a spawn-pool member and read "missing" most of the time (decision 1471's trap). Goldshire
//! also supplies the unit control (Marshal Dughan and the innkeeper are both questgiver-flagged),
//! which is why both halves can be read at one spot.
//!
//! Each window forces its own sweep, because that is the *only* way a GameObject GUID reaches the
//! wire: it sets the level (the reference's own `UNIT_FIELD_LEVEL` watch, and what makes the answer
//! change) and then bumps the packet epoch, so the window sweeps even if the character already
//! happened to be standing at the level the window wants. The starting level is restored on exit.
//!
//! **One trap the scan line will show you:** every probe character is permanently in GM mode
//! (`characters.extra_flags` bit `0x1`), and vmangos ORs `target->IsGameMaster()` into a
//! GameObject's `IsActivateToQuest` (`Object.cpp`) — so `GAMEOBJECT_DYN_FLAGS` reads `0x1` on
//! every quest object regardless of whether the character could actually take the quest. The
//! *dialog status* is computed without any GM term, so the windows below are unaffected; but do
//! not read the dyn-flag as "this quest is available to me", and do not gate a query on it.
//!
//! Grep `PROBE_GOQUEST:` for the verdict; the probe self-exits when it lands.
