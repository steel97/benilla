//! The **inside-a-battleground** live probe (`WOW_PROBE_BG=wsg|ab|av`) — the instrument that turns
//! "does a battleground work?" from a question nobody can answer into a census anyone can read.
//! Inert without the env.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Decisions 1963 / 1972 / 1974 / 1980 built the whole battleground **interface** — the queue, the
//! list window, the scoreboard, the always-up readout, the map blips, forty-odd Lua verbs — and
//! every one of them off the reference's own FrameXML. What none of them could build is the thing
//! on the far side of the port button: **nothing in this tree has ever entered map 489, 529 or
//! 30.** `ProbeBgQueuePlugin` stops at the queue by design (it is 2232's login-burst fixture);
//! the terrain, the world states, the objects, the spirit guides and the match's own end have
//! never been observed at all. So the gaps are not *known* to be gaps — they are unmeasured, and
//! an unmeasured subsystem is where a "should work by construction" quietly isn't.
//!
//! This probe is the measurement. It walks the real player road — level, greet a battlemaster on
//! the wire, queue, take the port through the **stock Lua verb** the reference's own dialog calls
//! — and then, from inside, prints a structured census every [`CENSUS_EVERY`] until
//! [`census_samples`] are in. Every later battleground round is judged against these lines.
//!
//! ## The one server-side lever, and why it is needed — and why it is turned back off
//!
//! A battleground does not start until `min_players_per_team` bodies are queued on each side —
//! four for Warsong Gulch on this server's patch, twenty for Alterac Valley
//! (`mangos.battleground_template`). One probe can never reach that. vmangos has the lever built
//! in: **`.debug bg`** toggles `BattleGroundMgr::m_testing`, and `BattleGroundQueue::CheckNormalMatch`
//! then starts a battleground as soon as *either* side has one player
//! (`BattleGroundMgr.cpp:557/623/756`). It is `SEC_ADMINISTRATOR` (6), exactly what a probe account
//! holds, and it is **in-memory only** — `m_testing` is initialised `false` in the manager's
//! constructor, so a server restart clears it whatever happens here.
//!
//! `.debug bg` is a **toggle, not a set**, and it announces itself to the whole realm
//! (`LANG_DEBUG_BG_ON`/`_OFF`). Both facts are reported on the probe's own lines so a run that
//! started from the wrong state reads as such rather than as a broken queue.
//!
//! **The lever is tracked by PARITY, not by state** ([`BgProbe::toggles_sent`]), and put back by
//! [`leave_testing_as_found`] — which every road to [`Phase::Done`] goes through, failures
//! included. "What is it now?" can only be answered by a world-text reply that may never arrive;
//! "how far from where I found it?" needs no reply at all. It is restored **as soon as the probe
//! is inside the instance**, because that is the moment the lever has finished its job: it is
//! needed for `CheckNormalMatch` to *form* the match, not to run one.
//!
//! Leaving it on also makes a solo battleground unendable: vmangos decrements its premature-finish
//! countdown inside an `else if (!sBattleGroundMgr.isTesting())` branch (`BattleGround.cpp:337`),
//! so while testing is on the countdown is armed and then **frozen**. Decision 2290 said the
//! opposite, from reading `GetPrematureFinishTime()` without the branch that consumes it; 2296
//! corrects it, having watched a run sit in Warsong Gulch for 492 s with `GetBattlefieldWinner()`
//! nil the whole way.
//!
//! ## What the census reports, and why each column is there
//!
//! | column | the question it answers |
//! |---|---|
//! | `map` / `area` | did the worldport land, and does the terrain know where we are? |
//! | `pos` | is the body at the battleground's own start location, or at the origin? |
//! | `terrain` | [`WorldLoadProgress`] — did map 489's ADTs stream, or is the ground missing? |
//! | `ents` | units / players / gameobjects / dynamic / corpses actually mirrored into the ECS |
//! | `gos` | the gameobject **entries** in range — the flags, the doors, the banners |
//! | `states` | the raw world-state table and its scope: the score, the flag carriers, the timer |
//! | `alwaysup` | `GetNumWorldStateUI()` — what the reference's readout would actually draw |
//! | `status` | `GetBattlefieldStatus(1..3)`, straight out of the VM |
//! | `score` | `GetNumBattlefieldScores()` / `GetBattlefieldWinner()` |
//! | `guide` | the nearest `SPIRITGUIDE`-flagged unit — the graveyard's resurrect wave |
//! | `dropped` | every opcode the codec threw on the floor, by name |
//! | `events` | the Lua event tap's window — or an explicit "the tap is broken", never silence |
//! | `mapinfo` | (at Report) `GetMapInfo()` and the overlay/landmark counts — whether the battle
//!   map has anything to **draw**, which `IsShown()` cannot tell you |
//!
//! There is deliberately **no `lua` column**; see the note at the end of [`census`] for why the one
//! that used to be here could not measure what it claimed.
//!
//! ## What this probe cannot see
//!
//! It calls [`crate::ui_chat::idle::LastInput::stamp_present`] every frame, which suppresses the
//! whole idle band — auto-sit, auto-AFK and camp alike (`ui_chat::idle::idle_action`). That is
//! deliberate and necessary (see the note at the top of [`bg_probe`]), but it means the one
//! long-running instrument that otherwise sits still for minutes can never exercise the idle
//! handler. A regression there has to be caught somewhere else.
//!
//! ## The run recipe
//!
//! ```sh
//! cd <slot> && WOW_USER=probe7 WOW_PASS=pprobe7 WOW_CHAR=Probeseven \
//!   WOW_UNATTENDED=1 WOW_NOSOUND=1 WOW_GM=off WOW_PROBE_BG=wsg \
//!   timeout 600 cargo run -p benilla 2>&1 | grep -E 'PROBE bg:'
//! ```
//!
//! Raise the `timeout` with [`census_samples`]: a default run needs ~5 min including login, and a
//! run sized to reach a match's ending needs ~10.
//!
//! `WOW_GM=off` is not optional here: GM mode re-templates the body's faction to 35, and a
//! battleground is the one place where every reaction, every objective and the server's own team
//! assignment reads off it (0649, 0679).
//!
//! Non-combat — the probe never attacks and never stands anywhere contested; with one player in
//! the instance there is nobody to fight. Pair with the SLOT-KEYED probe identity
//! (`method.md`, "The local vmangos server").
