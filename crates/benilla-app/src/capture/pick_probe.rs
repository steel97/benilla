//! `WOW_PICK` — the headless **"what is at this pixel, all the way back"** probe.
//!
//! The flicker instruments (decisions 0653/0656) localise a defect: `benilla-visual hotspot` hands
//! back a pixel box and says *this* is what would not hold still. Naming what is actually there was
//! then a manual step — read the ADT placements, guess which model the report meant, hope. The
//! interactive inspector ([`benilla_world::interact`]) answers it with a cursor, which an unattended probe
//! does not have.
//!
//! So: `WOW_PICK="<x>,<y>[;<x>,<y>…]"` (+ `WOW_PICK_AT=<secs>`, default 20) casts a ray through each
//! pixel and logs **every** hit along it, nearest first — not just the front one.
//!
//! `WOW_PICK_COUNT=<n>` / `WOW_PICK_EVERY=<secs>` (0 = one per frame) repeat the cast, the same shape
//! as the screenshot burst — because the cast honours `Visibility`, a hit that *vanishes* between
//! adjacent casts is a surface being **culled**, not one losing a depth test. That distinction is
//! invisible to a single cast and to the pixels alike: both look like the surface went away.
//!
//! Reporting the whole ray is the point. A surface that swaps with another between frames has a
//! rival *behind* it, and the gap between hit 0 and hit 1 is the number that decides the diagnosis:
//! an exact tie is a coplanar authoring tie (no depth precision can break it — only a deterministic
//! order or a bias), while a few millimetres is a precision question. The nearest hit alone cannot
//! tell those apart, and which one it is decides the fix.
//!
//! **The gap that decides it is the PERPENDICULAR one, not the distance along the ray** — reading
//! the along-ray gap as the separation is how B38 was mis-diagnosed twice. Where the ray meets a
//! surface obliquely it travels a long way between two planes that are barely apart; at the awning
//! there, hit 0 and hit 1 are 1–2 yd apart *along the ray* and 3–45 cm apart perpendicular. Both
//! are reported, along with each hit's **incidence angle**, because a surface nearly edge-on to the
//! ray is lost or won by sub-pixel coverage rather than by depth, and that is a different defect
//! wearing the same appearance.
//!
//! Each hit also names its **material and bound texture**, so "the same batch drew something else
//! this frame" is visible at all — it is indistinguishable from a depth fight in the pixels, and
//! ruling it out is what leaves the depth story standing.
//!
//! Coordinates are **screenshot pixels** — the same space `benilla-visual` reports boxes in — so a
//! hotspot box can be pasted straight in. They are divided by the window's scale factor here, since
//! `viewport_to_world` works in logical units and a Retina capture is 2× the logical window.
