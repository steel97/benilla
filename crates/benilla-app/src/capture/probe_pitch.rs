//! `WOW_PROBE_PITCH` — the scripted **dive**: aim a swimming avatar's nose up or down without a
//! human on the mouse. The twin of [`super::probe_look`]'s scripted turn, and it closes the same
//! shape of gap.
//!
//! The swim body pitch has exactly one writer in gameplay — the mouse-look push in
//! `player::controller`, gated on `mouselook` (a held right button or MOVEANDSTEER) *and* a moving
//! OS cursor inside the viewport. An unfocused probe window has neither. So the whole observed-swim
//! lane — the wire's pitch tail, the dead-reckon's pitched travel basis, and the body-pitch render
//! law (decision 0464 TU-A) — was **unreachable from any script**: a benilla client could be made
//! to swim, but only ever level. The tilt shipped in July 2026 with no test, no trace field and no
//! way to drive it, which is why "do other swimmers tilt?" had no answer short of the director's
//! eye, and why a two-client probe of it could not be written at all.
//!
//! Format: `WOW_PROBE_PITCH="<deg>@<start_s>[:<deg_per_sec>][;…]"` — `deg` is nose-**up** positive,
//! matching `Player::mover_pitch` and the wire's own sign. `"-30@22;30@40"` aims 30° down at
//! twenty-two seconds and 30° up at forty; `"-45@20:9"` starts level-ish and sweeps at 9°/s from
//! twenty seconds on, which is what a slow real dive looks like on the wire. The last entry whose
//! start has passed wins, and it is re-asserted **every frame** — the reference holds an unsteered
//! pitch rather than levelling it (TU-B(c)), so a one-shot write would be indistinguishable from a
//! held one; re-asserting is what makes the two separable when only one of them is under test.
//!
//! It writes [`Player::aim_pitch`] — the field the reference's `SetPitch` (`0x7c6f70`) writes,
//! under the same ±89° clamp — rather than faking mouse motion, for [`super::probe_look`]'s reason
//! exactly: the camera plumbing is not what is under test, and its `cursor_in_viewport` gate is
//! unreliable for a window nobody is looking at.
