//! The **frame-stall injector** (`WOW_STALL="<ms>[,<every_s>[,<after_s>[,<frames>]]]"`) — the
//! instrument that makes "I tabbed away and came back to X" reproducible.
//!
//! A probe window cannot be tabbed away from: every scripted live probe asserts `AlwaysOnTop`
//! ([`super::ProbeFocusPlugin`], decision 0906) precisely so the OS cannot throttle it. So the one
//! class of bug that only appears *because* the window went to the background — the client running
//! for seconds at ~1 fps and then resuming — had no reproduction at all. This is that reproduction:
//! it blocks the main loop for `<ms>` on each of `<frames>` consecutive frames, every `<every_s>`
//! seconds, starting at `<after_s>`. Nothing else.
//!
//! **What backgrounding actually does, and why this shape is the faithful one.** Two independent
//! mechanisms, and only the second one bites:
//!
//! - *winit* — we never set [`bevy::winit::WinitSettings`], so we get its `Default`, which is
//!   `WinitSettings::game()`: `focused_mode: Continuous`, `unfocused_mode:
//!   reactive_low_power(1/60 s)` (`bevy_winit-0.18.1/src/winit_config.rs:19-22`). An unfocused
//!   window therefore still targets **60 Hz**; losing focus on its own costs nothing.
//! - *macOS* — a window that is fully **covered** is throttled at the drawable: every
//!   `CAMetalLayer.nextDrawable` blocks about a second, so the run continues at ~1 fps for as long
//!   as it is covered (decisions 0713/0777; the director's correction in 0906 — "any covering
//!   window, not just the lock screen"; 1355 measured the signature as a `p99 ≈ 1020 ms`
//!   metronome). A ten-second glance at a terminal is therefore ~10 consecutive one-second frames,
//!   which is why `<frames>` exists: a *single* long frame is a hitch, and a hitch is not what
//!   backgrounding does.
//!
//! So the knob that reproduces a ten-second tab-away is `WOW_STALL="1000,20,60,10"`.
//!
//! **Not to be confused with `WOW_STALL_INJECT`** (`crate::perf::stall`, decisions 0713/1637),
//! whose name is one suffix away. That one fires **a single** sleep at a single instant, and it
//! exists to prove the stuck-main-thread *watchdog* fires — it is a test affordance for an
//! instrument, not a reproduction of a gameplay state. This one repeats, blocks `<frames>` in a
//! row, and carries the frame-delta/occlusion monitor, which is the whole difference: 1663 was
//! reproducible only with **consecutive** long frames (one alone loses the deck for a frame and
//! recovers; two drop the rider through it). The two should probably become one knob — flagged,
//! not done here.
//!
//! **`WOW_STALL="0"` injects nothing** and leaves only the monitor running — the "what is this
//! run's frame pacing actually doing" reader, which is how the premise above gets checked on a real
//! run instead of assumed. Every run prints, per window:
//!
//! ```text
//! STALL_WATCH t=35.0 frames=299 p50=16.7 p99=17.9 max=33.4 focused=1 occluded=0
//! STALL      t=35.0 sleeping 1000 ms (1/10)
//! STALL_HIT  t=36.0 injected=1000 wall_dt=1016.4 real_dt=16.7 virt_dt=16.7 clamped=0
//! ```
//!
//! **Three clocks on that line, and they are three different clocks — that is the point.**
//!
//! - `wall_dt` is [`Instant`] to [`Instant`] across the main-schedule pass: the true frame time,
//!   and the clock `transport::Transport::cycle_ms` runs on (`anchor.at.elapsed()`).
//! - `real_dt` is `Time<Real>`'s delta, which under pipelined rendering is **not** the wall clock:
//!   `time_system` stamps it from an `Instant` the *render world* sends over a `bounded(2)` channel
//!   (`bevy_time-0.18.1/src/lib.rs:152-171`, `bevy_render-0.18.1/src/renderer/mod.rs:113`), so it
//!   arrives a frame or two late — bevy's own source carries a `TODO: Figure out how to handle
//!   this when using pipelined rendering` right above it.
//! - `virt_dt` is what every consumer of `Res<Time>` integrates: `real_dt` after the frame pacer,
//!   clamped to `Time<Virtual>`'s stock 250 ms `max_delta`. `clamped=1` marks the frames where the
//!   clamp bit.
//!
//! A `focused=`/`occluded=` transition prints its own line the moment it lands.
