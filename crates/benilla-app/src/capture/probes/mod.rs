//! The LIVE-run probe instruments — every plugin here rides a NORMAL connected session (unlike
//! the parent's server-less [`super::CapturePlugin`] harness): scripted chat sends
//! ([`ProbeChatPlugin`]), synthetic key taps ([`ProbeKeyPlugin`]), a Lua chunk in the live UI VM
//! ([`ProbeLuaPlugin`]), the bounded-lifetime self-exit ([`ProbeExitPlugin`]), and the live
//! frame-time sampler ([`LiveFpsPlugin`]). The live screenshot and its validity gates live in the
//! sibling [`super::live_shot`]. Each is env-gated and registered by `main`; compose them for
//! unattended "park, act, observe" probes.
