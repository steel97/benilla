/// The PROBE DRAG driver (`WOW_PROBE_DRAG="A>B[;C>D…]"`, delay via `WOW_PROBE_DRAG_AT` seconds
/// (default 14), one gesture step per `WOW_PROBE_DRAG_STEP` seconds (default 0.1)): drag one named
/// frame onto another **through the real pointer path**, headlessly, in a live session.
///
/// **Why this exists as an instrument rather than a unit test.** The UI's own harness can already
/// press, move and release ([`UiScript::mouse_button`]/`mouse_move`), and a drag test written
/// there passes while the live client's drag is broken — because the harness supplies the whole
/// world: no per-frame app feed between the press and the release, no real frames elapsing, no
/// resolve pass, no `feed_party` re-push, no OS cursor. That gap cost a session (B310: the raid
/// grid's second drag). This closes it by driving the SAME gesture in a real client: the press,
/// the threshold-crossing move, the path, and the release each land on their own frame, with
/// every app system running in between exactly as it does for a hand on the mouse.
///
/// It names FRAMES, not coordinates, and reads their centres out of the live layout, so a probe
/// line survives a window moving. `WOW_PROBE_DRAG_LUA="<chunk>"` runs a chunk after each gesture —
/// the report channel (`ProbeLog` from [`ProbeLuaPlugin`] is installed by that probe; this one
/// prints the chunk's own returned string).
/// The HOVER SWEEP (`WOW_PROBE_HOVER="Frame1;Frame2;…"`, `WOW_PROBE_HOVER_AT` seconds, default 14,
/// `WOW_PROBE_HOVER_STEP` seconds per frame-to-frame step, default 0.25, looping until exit) —
/// the cursor crosses each named frame's centre through the REAL pointer path, pressing nothing.
///
/// **A leg that does not ALTERNATE cannot be read.** `WOW_PROBE_HOVER_DUTY=<on>:<off>` sweeps for
/// `on` seconds, parks the pointer over nothing for `off`, and repeats. Compare-the-two-halves
/// designs that put all the parked frames at the start and all the swept frames after read the
/// run's own drift as the effect: three legs of the same gesture, same binary, gave within-run
/// `cpu_ms` deltas of +2.03, +1.02 and −0.61 ms while their per-phase µs columns agreed to 3%
/// (decision 1634). Alternating pools both regimes across the same minutes, so drift cancels
/// instead of landing on one side.
///
/// **`WOW_PROBE_HOVER_STEP` is the dial that decides what is being measured, and the default is
/// not the director's gesture.** A hand spamming hovers moves the mouse *every frame*; at the
/// 0.25 s default only 4 frames in 60 carry a pointer move, which divides whatever a move costs by
/// fifteen and reads as "hovering is free" (it did, three times, before this note existed). Set it
/// to ~0.016 to sweep at frame rate. `WOW_PROBE_HOVER_JITTER=<px>` then splits the two halves the
/// sweep otherwise fuses: with one name and a jitter, the pointer moves every frame while the
/// hovered frame and its tooltip stay put.
///
/// Built because a hover-cost pin was taken with a Lua driver that called `GameTooltip:SetOwner`
/// directly, and that driver is not the gesture: it never moves `model.mouseover`, so it skips the
/// hit test, `OnEnter`/`OnLeave`, the button's state textures and highlight, and whatever the
/// shipped UI hangs off those. The reported symptom was "hovering costs 2 ms" and the instrument
/// could not hover. This is the missing half of `WOW_HOVER_LOG`: that one records what a hand on
/// the mouse does, and this one supplies the hand.
