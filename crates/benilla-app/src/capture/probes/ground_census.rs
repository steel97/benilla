//! The **under-floor census** (`WOW_GROUND_CENSUS=<secs>[,<every>]`) — the instrument that closes
//! B197's symptom: *"±half the NPCs in one building sit below the floor"*.
//!
//! Every reported site of that bug was a picture. A picture cannot say whether a unit is below the
//! floor **because the server put it there** (then it is the server's ledger) or because *we* pulled
//! it down off the pose the server sent (then it is ours), and it cannot say whether the floor the
//! unit belongs on is even collidable from where it stands. Both questions are one line of numbers
//! per unit:
//!
//! ```text
//! UGD 0x…  unit "Stormwind Guard"  z=5.02  seat=9.14  drop=+4.12  terrain=5.02  above=9.07 (+4.05)  spline=0 swim=0
//! ```
//!
//! - **`seat`** is the server's own Z for this unit — the pose the create block / a move packet /
//!   its spline last wrote ([`GroundClamped::seat_y`]), before the ground clamp had its say.
//! - **`drop`** is `seat − z`: how far the clamp pulled the unit *below* the server's pose. This is
//!   the number that names the bug; on a healthy scene it is within a yard either way (the clamp's
//!   whole job is a small correction), and `sunk` counts the ones past [`SUNK_YD`].
//! - **`above`** is the lowest walkable surface strictly above the unit's feet, found by walking a
//!   one-sided down-ray through the stack. A unit with a floor right there and a big `drop` is
//!   standing under a floor it could be standing on — the exact shape of the report.
//! - **`terrain`** is the MCNK height under it, which is what the clamp finds when a building's own
//!   collider has not attached yet.
//!
//! Pair it with the slot-keyed probe identity and a `.go` to the reported spot:
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_USER=probeN WOW_PASS=pprobeN WOW_CHAR=Probe<n> WOW_NOSOUND=1 \
//!   WOW_PROBE_CHAT=".go xyz 6558.80 457.23 9.07 1" \
//!   WOW_GROUND_CENSUS="30,15" WOW_PROBE_EXIT_AT=75 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//!
//! The repeat form is the load-race half: a census at 30 s and again at 45 s says whether a sunk
//! unit *stays* sunk once the world has finished arriving, which is what separates a transient from
//! the ratchet decision 1384 removed.
//!
//! It lists exactly the bodies the clamp is responsible for ([`ground_derived`]) — since B357 that
//! includes a **player the server moves along a spline**, which the `player` tag names. That is the
//! whole readout for a Playerbots server: a bot mid-path reads `player spline=1` with a small
//! `drop`, and the bug it closes read the wire Z with no row here at all.
