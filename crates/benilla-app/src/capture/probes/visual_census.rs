//! The **unit-visual census** (`WOW_UNIT_VISUALS=<secs>[,<every>]`) — the instrument that closes
//! B13's symptom: *"the invisible trigger NPC displays as a black block"*.
//!
//! Every site of that bug arrived as a screenshot of a black slab, and a screenshot cannot say
//! which of the two things a slab is. Both look identical and they call for opposite fixes:
//!
//! - the entity's display named **no model we could load** — a gap of ours, and the cube is the
//!   debug signal that says so (it renders black rather than its authored red only because an
//!   unlit `StandardMaterial` catches no light in our scene);
//! - the entity's display named a model which **draws nothing** — how an invisible trigger
//!   creature hides in the real client, and nothing should be drawn at all (decision 1403).
//!
//! One line per streamed entity says which, without an eye:
//!
//! ```text
//! UVIS 0xF130003A7200013B Unit  display=13069 d=6.4  cube=1 meshes=0 pick=1 held=[] Zandalarian Event Generator
//! ```
//!
//! - **`cube`** is the [`FallbackCube`] marker — literally the arm that spawned it, not a guess
//!   from the picture. The headline `cubes=` count is the number that names the bug.
//! - **`meshes`** counts the entity's spawned render children — the BODY's own batches. `cube=0
//!   meshes=0` is the *correct* reading for a trigger creature: attached, and drawing nothing.
//! - **`held`** is the attach-slot list actually hanging off its skeleton
//!   ([`HeldAttached::spawned_slots`], the dress census's own reader). It is here because
//!   `meshes` counts *direct* children and an attached model is a grandchild, so a unit whose
//!   whole visible self is a held weapon — the Naxxramas `Unholy Axe`, an `InvisibleStalker` body
//!   with an axe in its hand — reads `meshes=0` whether the axe is there or not. That blind spot
//!   is what let decision 1656's defect sit under a green census; `held=[main]` is the line that
//!   says the weapon arrived.
//! - **`pick`** counts the parts the **mouseover** would actually ray-test — every skinned part
//!   across the unit's chained model roots ([`crate::target::hover::pick_model_roots`]: the body,
//!   everything it wears, its mount), plus its fallback-box children where it has no skinned parts
//!   at all. `pick=0` means the unit cannot be hovered or clicked *at all* and only its name plate
//!   can select it — which is the second half of what the Naxxramas weapon mobs reported and what
//!   neither `meshes` nor `held` could say: `held=[main]` proves the axe is *attached*, never that
//!   it is *clickable* (decision 1658).
//! - **`pending`** marks an entity whose visual has not been built yet (a model still streaming) —
//!   never to be confused with one that built nothing, which is the distinction the census exists
//!   to keep.
//!
//! Pair it with the slot-keyed probe identity and a `.go` to the reported spot:
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_USER=probeN WOW_PASS=pprobeN WOW_CHAR=Probe<n> WOW_NOSOUND=1 \
//!   WOW_PROBE_CHAT=".go xyz -11847.0 1280.9 3.2 0" \
//!   WOW_UNIT_VISUALS="45,15" WOW_PROBE_EXIT_AT=90 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//!
//! The repeat form is the load-race half: a census at 45 s and again at 60 s says whether a `cube`
//! is a *verdict* or just an entity whose model had not landed yet — the same transient-vs-ratchet
//! separation `WOW_GROUND_CENSUS` makes for the under-floor report.
