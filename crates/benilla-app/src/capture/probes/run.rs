/// `caffeinate` note), at the smallest footprint that still buys it.
///
/// The on-top half used to live inside the FPS probe alone, which reads as "a frame-rate concern".
/// It is not: **every** scripted probe schedule is wall-clock ([`ProbeClock`]), so a throttled run
/// doesn't just measure slowly, it *executes the wrong script* — one session's mounted-jump run
/// fired `W@16` and `Space@19` in the SAME frame at ~1 fps, i.e. it jumped from a standstill
/// instead of mid-run, and the leg had to be re-read to notice (decision 0906). Any probe env arms
/// it, so a key/chat/Lua probe defends itself exactly like the FPS one.
///
/// **The parking half is the other side of that bill** (decision 1148). Asserting `AlwaysOnTop`
/// every frame silently defeats [`benilla_world::bgwin`]'s whole design — it overrides the
/// `AlwaysOnBottom` birth cage *and* the `Normal` handed back at release — so an instrumented run
/// sits on top for its entire life however politely it was launched. At the full-size default that
/// is a screen-filling window over whatever the director is doing, and a session that fires six
/// probes fires six of them (which is how it got reported). The answer is not to drop the
/// assertion — the throttle is real — but to shrink what is being asserted:
/// [`benilla_world::bgwin::no_pixel_run`] sizes such a run at 640×360 and this parks it in the top-right
/// corner. A run that photographs pixels is excluded from both and keeps the full window.
///
/// Write-gated on both counts: re-marking `Window` every frame would re-apply its whole state
/// through winit, and the park is one-shot, latched once a monitor is actually readable (the
/// monitor entities do not exist on frame 1).
