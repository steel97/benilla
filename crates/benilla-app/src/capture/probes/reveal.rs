//! The **reveal audit** (`WOW_REVEAL=<frames>`) — one line per frame from a snap, naming every
//! term that decides whether the world the player is about to be shown is actually there.
//!
//! "Teleported and the city wasn't drawn for a frame or more" is a *temporal* claim about the
//! frames either side of a reveal, and neither a screenshot nor the loading screen's own 3-second
//! wait line can hold one: the screenshot is one frame with no state attached, and the wait line
//! only speaks for loads slow enough to be stuck. This prints the whole window — the cover, the
//! residency terms behind [`WorldLoadProgress::presentable`], the settle hold, and the retained
//! pass's collected-vs-published region counts — so "which term let the reveal through" is read
//! off a column instead of guessed.
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_USER=probe1 WOW_PASS=pprobe1 WOW_CHAR=Probeone \
//!   WOW_PROBE_CHAT=".go xyz -9250.45 160.86 67.90 0;.tele stormwind" \
//!   WOW_PROBE_CHAT_AT=20 WOW_PROBE_CHAT_EVERY=25 WOW_REVEAL=120 \
//!   WOW_PROBE_EXIT_AT=70 cargo run -q -p benilla | grep REVEAL
//! ```
//!
//! The arming edge is the snap itself (a same-map teleport or a worldport), so the window covers
//! the frames a cover would have to be up for — and, when none is, the frames the player is
//! looking at the destination through nothing at all.
//!
//! **It runs in `Last`, and that is load-bearing.** Half of what decides whether a frame has a
//! world in it is settled in `PostUpdate` — bevy's visibility check, the exterior-scene gate, the
//! retained pass's own scene walk — and a line printed in `Update` reports those columns from the
//! *previous* frame. Against a one-or-two-frame artefact an off-by-one instrument is worse than
//! none: it attributes the hole to the frame beside it. In `Last` every column below is this
//! frame's, residency and draw alike.
//!
//! The columns split into two halves on purpose. **Residency** (`res`, `focus`, `scene`, `place`,
//! `coll`, `merge`, `gx`) is *what the world has* — the terms behind
//! [`WorldLoadProgress::presentable`], the ones the cover is raised and cleared on. **Draw**
//! (`drawn`, `hid`, `sel`, `room`, `win`, `pvseye`) is *what the frame put on screen*. A reveal
//! defect where every residency term reads ready and the draw half has collapsed is not a
//! streaming bug at all — it is the visibility authority answering about somewhere else.
