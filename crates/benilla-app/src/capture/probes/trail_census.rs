//! The **ribbon-trail census** (`WOW_TRAIL_CENSUS=<secs>[,<every>]`) — the instrument that turns
//! *"the weapon particles trail behind while the lift goes up"* into a line of numbers.
//!
//! A streak in a screenshot cannot say whether it is **right**. A weapon trail is *supposed* to
//! smear — that is the whole effect, and its length is `host speed × edgeLifetime` by design. The
//! bug the director reported is not "there is a streak", it is that the streak is drawn against
//! the **world** while the host is standing still on a moving **deck**. Those two look identical
//! in a still frame and are one subtraction apart in numbers:
//!
//! - **`world_dy`** — the strip's vertical extent in world space, and **the observable**. A rider
//!   standing still on a moving deck must draw a streak that is *short in world space*: with the
//!   ride frame the edges are stored on the deck and re-projected through its live pose, so the
//!   whole strip travels rigidly with the car and never stretches. Without it the edges are frozen
//!   in the world while the car climbs out from under them, and the strip grows to
//!   `deck speed × edgeLifetime`. So on a **vertical** lift the reading is simply: `world_dy ≈ 0`
//!   is right, `world_dy ≈ deck speed × edgeLifetime` is the bug (decision 1591's unbuilt gap,
//!   1661's fix).
//! - **`deck_ext`** — the strip's extent measured *inside the transport's frame*. **It cannot
//!   differ from the world reading in Y**: `A` is `translate · Rz` (see
//!   [`benilla_world::ride_frame::ride_matrix`]), and a yaw plus a translation leaves a vertical
//!   extent invariant. It earns its column only on a **turning** transport — a boat swinging
//!   through a bend, where the in-plane extent does differ — and stands as a self-check on a lift,
//!   where it must equal the world one. (This column was first written claiming `world_dy` large
//!   with `deck_dy` small was the finding; that pair is unreachable by construction, and saying so
//!   here is cheaper than the next reader re-deriving it.)
//!
//! ```text
//! TRAIL_CENSUS t=85.0 trails=1 riding=1 stamped=1 deck=0xf12000104a00477a deckY=101.96 worst=0.00
//! TRAIL 168v1 bone=24  edges=25 life=0.50s vis=- | world_dy= 0.00 world_ext= 0.25 deck_ext= 0.25
//! ```
//!
//! Off a transport `deck=` reads `-` and the deck columns are the world ones, which is the control:
//! this census must not change on the ground, where a streak *should* smear behind a moving host.
//!
//! Pair it with the slot-keyed probe identity and a `.go` onto the Thunder Bluff lift:
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_USER=probeN WOW_PASS=pprobeN WOW_CHAR=Probe<n> WOW_NOSOUND=1 \
//!   WOW_PROBE_CHAT=".go xyz -1286.2 189.7 132.0 1" \
//!   WOW_TRAIL_CENSUS="35,5" WOW_PROBE_EXIT_AT=75 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//!
//! The repeat form is the point: one census says what the strip looked like at an instant, a
//! series across the lift's travel says whether the deck-relative spread *grows with the ride*.
