/// **`WOW_LIVE_SHOT_COUNT=<n>` makes it a burst** — `n` shots written as `<stem>-000.png`,

/// unchanged.
///
/// The burst exists because **a flicker is a temporal artefact and a single frame cannot show one**
/// (decision 0653). "This object's textures flicker" was un-diagnosable with the instruments we had:
/// the reporter's stills prove nothing, and grading a live run by eye is exactly the loop rule 7
/// forbids. Adjacent frames from a *parked* camera ([`crate::player`]'s `WOW_PROBE_CAM`) turn it
/// into arithmetic: `benilla-visual flicker <dir>` collapses the burst to the envelope of what
/// would not hold still, and the lit pixels are the defect.
///
/// **`WOW_SHOT_REQUIRE=<name>` is the SUBJECT gate** (substring, case-insensitive; range via
/// `WOW_SHOT_REQUIRE_DIST`, default 60): no shot fires until a unit with that name is inside the
/// viewport and range — the same contract as the death gate below, because a frame that cannot
/// contain the reported subject is not a measurement of it either. Ten banshee runs were once read
/// as "can't reproduce" with the banshee never in frame, and a voidwalker crop-negative was a model
/// that had wandered out of a fixed window (decision 0705). While the subject is missing the gate
/// WARNs with what *is* nearby — names and distances — so a mis-aimed run re-aims itself instead of
/// ending as a silent blank; a run that exits with 0 shots written names its reason in the log.
/// The unit's feet anchor decides "in frame", and in frame does not mean unoccluded — the gate
/// closes the aim trap, not line-of-sight.
