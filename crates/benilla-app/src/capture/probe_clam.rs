//! The openable-item live probe (`WOW_PROBE_CLAM=1`) — **the clam instrument**: right-click a
//! LOOTABLE item in the bags and does a loot window actually open?
//!
//! The director, 2026-08-22: *"Clams don't open anymore. I right click them and they turn gray
//! correctly but no loot window opens ever."* Both halves of that sentence are readings this probe
//! takes separately, because they come from two different pre-send writes in the same emitter
//! (`0x5edc80`, wow-re `loot-anim-leg.md` §5 / `inventory-change-failure-display.md` §8):
//!
//! - the **grey lock** ([`PendingItemOps`], `0x4953e0` at `0x5edcd9`) — the half that kept working;
//! - the **loot latch** ([`LootLatch`], `0x5edcc0`) — the half decision 1477 left unmodelled, on
//!   the reading that an item arm changes no pose. It changes no pose and it is still load-bearing:
//!   vmangos answers `CMSG_OPEN_ITEM` with `SendLoot(item guid, LOOT_CORPSE)`, so
//!   `SMSG_LOOT_RESPONSE` comes back **type 1** on the item's own guid, and 1477's admission gate
//!   *refuses* a type-1 answer against a cold latch — bounces a `CMSG_LOOT_RELEASE` and opens
//!   nothing. Grey clam, no window, forever. Decision 1531.
//!
//! **The window is a number here, not a picture.** The probe drives the click through the live UI
//! VM's own `UseContainerItem(0, slot)` — the same binding the bag button calls, so the whole
//! dispatcher (`ui_items::drain::drain_container_uses`) runs for real — and then reads
//! `LootFrame:IsShown()` plus the app-side session guid. Four readings, in order, which is what
//! makes it a regression test rather than a one-sided assertion:
//!
//! 1. **BEFORE** — the clam sitting in the bag, unclicked: no loot window. The control; a probe
//!    that only ever sees a window cannot tell a fix from a window that was already up.
//! 2. **OPEN** — after the click: a window, whose session guid is the **clam's own item guid**
//!    (not a corpse's, not zero), with the grey lock on its slot.
//! 3. **CLOSED** — `CloseLoot()` through the live VM: the window goes and the latch clears.
//! 4. **REOPEN** — the same clam clicked again: it opens a second time. The adjacent state that
//!    catches a latch which arms once and never re-arms (the classic "works the first time" shape).
//!
//! ## The run recipe
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_NOSOUND=1 WOW_USER=probe0 WOW_PASS=pprobe0 WOW_CHAR=Probezero \
//!     WOW_PROBE_CLAM=1 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//! (the slot-keyed probe identity — `pool-N` → `probeN`/`pprobeN`/`Probe<N-spelled>`, `method.md`
//! "The local vmangos server"). `WOW_PROBE_CLAM=<entry>` aims it at a different openable template;
//! the default is a Small Barnacled Clam (7973 — `Flags` LOOTABLE with `LockID = 0`, so it is
//! openable the moment it exists: no key, no lockpicking). The probe `.additem`s its own copy and
//! subtracts it again on the way out, so it leaves the character as it found it.
//!
//! Auto-loot is forced **off** for the run: with it on, the clam's single row is taken at the open
//! edge and the last-row auto-release closes the window within a frame or two, which would read as
//! "no window" for the wrong reason.
//!
//! Grep `PROBE_CLAM:` for the verdict; the probe self-exits when it lands.
