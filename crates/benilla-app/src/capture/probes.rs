//! The LIVE-run probe instruments — every plugin here rides a NORMAL connected session (unlike
//! the parent's server-less [`super::CapturePlugin`] harness): scripted chat sends
//! ([`ProbeChatPlugin`]), synthetic key taps ([`ProbeKeyPlugin`]), a Lua chunk in the live UI VM
//! ([`ProbeLuaPlugin`]), the bounded-lifetime self-exit ([`ProbeExitPlugin`]), and the live
//! frame-time sampler ([`LiveFpsPlugin`]). The live screenshot and its validity gates live in the
//! sibling [`super::live_shot`]. Each is env-gated and registered by `main`; compose them for
//! unattended "park, act, observe" probes.

/// A probe knob is a wall-clock instruction: "send this at 20 s", "sample 300 frames from 25 s",
/// "resize at 12 s", "exit at 480 s". `Time<Virtual>` cannot honour one — it clamps every frame delta
/// to `max_delta` (250 ms, `bevy_time`'s default), so on any leg that hitches (a streaming burst, an
/// occluded window, a loaded machine) it falls behind real time and drags the whole schedule with it.
/// The knob then means something the operator never asked for, *silently*.
///
/// **Third time this clock has cost us a measurement.** 0615 moved the relayed-move replay off it
/// (and cites the UI script clock as the same lesson before that); then B131's first causal leg was
/// destroyed by it here — the probe-chat hops drifted 40 s → 75 s apart, so windows labelled
/// "parked, ticks off" in fact contained a teleport and live ticks, and an eight-minute leg had to be
/// thrown away (decision 0785's discarded run). A named alias is what makes the next probe get it
/// right without knowing the story: type this, and the mistake is unavailable.
