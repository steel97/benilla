//! The **NPC-service ladder** live probe (`WOW_PROBE_SERVICE=1`) — decision 1861's end-to-end
//! instrument, and the answer to "does right-clicking a trainer or a quest giver really open their
//! window instead of a gossip menu?".
//!
//! 1861 replaced a cursor-kind dispatch with the reference's own first-match-wins walk over
//! `UNIT_NPC_FLAGS` ([`crate::target::click::service_arm`]; wow-re
//! `object-layer/scratch/interact-dead-fork-and-npc-service-ladder.md` §C). **Bit 0 (GOSSIP) is
//! tested first**, so the flag — not the profession — decides: a trainer or questgiver that also
//! carries GOSSIP still opens a gossip menu, and only a flagless one opens its own window. That
//! precedence is the whole question, and it is invisible to a unit test: the bits come off the
//! wire, and what appears on screen is the *server's* answer to the opcode the ladder picked.
//!
//! So the probe walks four real Northshire/Stormwind NPCs, one per interesting flag shape, and for
//! each one reports the wire's `UNIT_NPC_FLAGS`, the arm the shipped ladder takes, the opcode it
//! sends, and which window actually opened:
//!
//! | NPC | `npc_flags` | arm | window |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | Marshal McBride (197) | `0x03` GOSSIP\|QUESTGIVER | Gossip | gossip menu |
//! | Llane Beshere (911) | `0x13` GOSSIP\|QUESTGIVER\|TRAINER | Gossip | gossip menu |
//! | *any pure questgiver with an offer* | `0x02`, GOSSIP clear | Questgiver | quest frame |
//! | Alma Jainrose (812) | `0x10` TRAINER only | Trainer | trainer frame |
//!
//! The flag column is live-DB verified this session (`vmangos-deploy` → `mangos`,
//! `SELECT entry, name, npc_flags FROM creature_template`), and reported again from the wire on
//! every run — a template edit shows up as a note beside the reading rather than as a mystery FAIL.
//!
//! **The ladder is called, never re-implemented.** The probe reads the same two inputs the click
//! reads (`ObjectStore::unit_npc_flags` and [`QuestGiver::status`]) and calls the shipped
//! `service_arm`/`service_action`; only the mouse hit-test and the cursor's range gray sit outside
//! it. A private copy of the bit table is exactly how a probe goes quietly stale (the B249 icon
//! map), so there isn't one.
//!
//! **The pure-questgiver row is found by predicate, not by entry.** Whether Deputy Willem has
//! anything for *this* probe character depends on what it has already turned in, and the bit-1 arm
//! is gated on that status (`[unit+0xcb8] ∉ {0,1}`). So that leg hops into Northshire and takes the
//! first streamed unit that is QUESTGIVER, not GOSSIP, and actually has an offer — reporting which
//! one it picked. If the character has cleared the whole valley it SKIPs and says so.
//!
//! One `PROBE_SERVICE: <leg> PASS/FAIL/SKIP <detail>` line per leg, then a final
//! `PROBE_SERVICE: DONE pass=<n> fail=<m> skip=<k>`. A wrong arm or a wrong window is a FAIL; an
//! environmental problem (the `.go` refused, the NPC never streamed, no offer left in the valley)
//! is a SKIP with the reason.
//!
//! ## The run recipe
//!
//! ```text
//! WOW_DATA=WoW/Data WOW_USER=probe4 WOW_PASS=pprobe4 WOW_CHAR=Probefour \
//!     WOW_UNATTENDED=1 WOW_PROBE_SERVICE=1 cargo run -q -p benilla
//! ```
//! (the slot-keyed probe identity — method.md "The local vmangos server"). Non-combat, GM mode
//! left as found, nothing bought and nothing turned in: every leg opens a window and closes it
//! client-side, which is what the reference's own close does (`ui_gossip`: there is no
//! `CMSG_GOSSIP_CLOSE` in 1.12).
