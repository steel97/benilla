//! The `waterfx` capture viewer — the foam **instrument** (decision 0022: see it before tuning
//! it). A server-less synthetic rig: one dummy wading unit over a synthetic water footprint
//! (a real 4.1667-yd wet-cell lattice, so patch building and bank clipping run for real) with a
//! flat backdrop for contrast, driven through the NORMAL emitter path — nothing here bypasses the
//! shipped systems; the rig only supplies a unit, water, and motion.
//!
//! `WOW_CAPTURE=waterfx` + knobs: `WOW_WFX_MODE` (`ring`|`wake`|`turn`), `WOW_WFX_SPEED` (yd/s),
//! `WOW_WFX_HEAD` (wake heading, WoW degrees, 0 = +X — point it along a real bank),
//! `WOW_WFX_AGE` (s of motion before the shot), `WOW_WFX_DEPTH` (yd below the surface; > ~0.8
//! also exercises the step-in one-shot), camera `WOW_WFX_AZ`/`EL`/`DIST`. Not a golden scenario —
//! output depends on the knobs.
//!
//! **`WOW_WFX_AT=x,y,z` wades the dummy in the REAL world instead** (`z` = the liquid surface
//! height there, which `benilla-formats --example water_here` prints). The synthetic lattice and
//! backdrop stand down and the rig wades in the streamed ADT/WMO liquid at that pin — which is the
//! only way to see the two things a synthetic square of water cannot show: how a patch **clips at a
//! real bank**, and how it **sorts against the neighbouring water chunks** (B348 — one square of
//! water has no neighbour to be painted over by). `WOW_MAP` picks the map.
