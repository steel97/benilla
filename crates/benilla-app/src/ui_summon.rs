//! Being summoned — the server's question, its dialog, and the one word back (decision 1747).
//!
//! **The law this module exists for: the client's whole part in a summon is a dialog and an echo.**
//! A warlock's Ritual of Summoning, a meeting stone and a GM's `.summon` all converge on the same
//! `SMSG_SUMMON_REQUEST`; the client parks three fields, raises `CONFIRM_SUMMON`, and — only if
//! Accept is pressed — sends `CMSG_SUMMON_RESPONSE` carrying the summoner's guid.
//! **Declining sends nothing at all.** There is no decline opcode and no accept flag in the body:
//! 1.12 has no `CancelSummon` binding (`reference/1.12-globals.tsv` has exactly four names in this
//! family), so a refused summon is silence plus the server's own two-minute expiry. That is why
//! nothing here has a "no" path.
//!
//! The Era surface it drives is the reference's own (`StaticPopup.lua:1336-1357`,
//! `UIParent.lua:126`/`551-552`): the `CONFIRM_SUMMON` event, fired with **no arguments**, and the
//! four engine globals the dialog reads back through ([`benilla_ui::script`]'s `summon` module).
//!
//! Byte-pinned against the reference's own handler `0x5e6140` (the opcode→handler map at the
//! `0x5ab650` registration site gives it `0x2ab`), its latch `0x4963a0`, and the four bindings
//! `0x48b660`/`0x48b6a0`/`0x48b720`/`0x48b770`:
//!
//! 1. **The latch is four globals and nothing structured.** `0x4963a0` writes the guid to
//!    `[0xb4e358]/[0xb4e35c]`, the zone id to `[0xb4e354]`, and `OsGetAsyncTimeMs() + delay` to
//!    `[0xb4e350]`, then calls `FrameScript_SignalEvent(516)` with no varargs. [`SummonState`] is
//!    those four fields, with the deadline on `Time<Real>` for [`crate::death`]'s reason: a window
//!    the *server* sends counts down in real seconds, and the virtual clock's `max_delta` clamp
//!    would quietly lengthen it.
//! 2. **A dead *or ghost* player is refused the question outright.** Ahead of the latch the handler
//!    resolves the active player (`0x468550` → `0x468460` with typemask `0x10` = player) and, if
//!    `0x605f30` says yes, returns without latching *or* firing (`5e6194: jne`). So the request
//!    does not merely fail to show a dialog: it does not disturb a previously latched one either,
//!    which is why [`apply::request`] is the gate and the popup engine's `whileDead` rule is not.
//!
//!    **`0x605f30` is not "is dead"** — that reading cost a wrong first cut here. It is
//!    `[values+0x40] <= 0` (signed, `605f3b: jle`) **OR** (typemask bit `0x10` **AND** the
//!    `PLAYER_FLAGS` ghost bit at `[[obj+0xe68]+8] & 0x10`, `605f3d..605f59`). A ghost's wire
//!    health is **1**, so the first leg alone lets a ghost through; the second is what stops it.
//!    Both legs are read here, and neither is `unit_reads_dead`'s triple (`0x605f90`), which is
//!    a different function with a dyn-flag and stand-state leg this one does not have.
//!    A *missing* player object falls through to the latch — a NULL is sent through
//!    (`5e6189: je`), so the safe default is to ask.
//! 3. **`GetSummonConfirmAreaName()` is the summoner's zone, straight out of `AreaTable.dbc`**
//!    (`0x48b720`: bounds-check, row pointer, `[row + locale*4 + 0x2c]`) — **no parent-zone walk
//!    and no GlobalString tail**, unlike the innkeeper question's three-step chain
//!    ([`crate::ui_binder::area_name`], `0x5dfe5e`). An id the table cannot name renders `""`.
//! 4. **`GetSummonConfirmSummoner()` answers `""` on a cache miss — and the miss is not inert.**
//!    `0x48b6a0` → `DBCache::NameCache::GetRecord 0x55f080` against the cache at `0xc0e228`, else
//!    the shared empty string `0x882748`; but a missing record makes `0x55f120` allocate one and
//!    **send a name query** (`0x55f1fa`), whose arrival signals nothing. So the real name surfaces
//!    only because the popup engine re-reads all three getters every OnUpdate frame — *a client
//!    that formats the text once shows an empty summoner forever.* That is what makes
//!    `UiPanels.xml`'s `CONFIRM_SUMMON` countdown arm the mechanism rather than a transcription,
//!    and it is why the event is not held back for the name the way `DUEL_REQUESTED` (0633) is:
//!    that event carries its name as `arg1`, and this one has no argument to hold.
//!
//!    [`crate::names::NameCache::resolve`] is the same shape — answer or ask, once — so the feed
//!    below asks on every frame the question is live and reports whatever has landed.
//!
//! **Two deviations, both deliberate.**
//!
//! - **The reference never clears the latched guid or zone — nothing in the image does.** Each of
//!   the three cells has exactly one writer (the latch) and no clearer, so a second pending summon
//!   silently overwrites the first, and a `ConfirmSummon()` typed at the console with nothing
//!   pending sends a packet built from whatever is left in the bank. Only the *deadline* is ever
//!   zeroed, by `0x49014a` inside the login-side init `0x48fbf0`. We keep the overwrite (it is the
//!   behaviour) and drop the whole latch on the session edge ([`end_session_summon`]), refusing to
//!   send with no summoner: the reference reaches the same state one step later, at the next
//!   login-side init, and nothing can read the bank in between.
//! - We do **not** gate the send on the deadline, and that is the reference's own shape rather than
//!   an oversight: `ConfirmSummon 0x48b770` tests nothing and does not clear the latch, so two
//!   Accepts are two packets. vmangos is the thing that makes a late one harmless — its handler
//!   *ignores the guid entirely* and checks its own `m_summon_expire`.
