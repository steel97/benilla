//! The app-side **character-window feed** (decision 0208 §3/§4): the bridge that turns our own
//! avatar's descriptor + the item stores into the plain snapshots the paper doll's Lua bindings
//! read, and into the Era events that drive its `OnEvent` repaints — the [`crate::ui_unit`]
//! pattern, for the combat-stats/inventory surface.
//!
//! Three jobs, each frame, before the VM ticks ([`UiInput`]):
//!
//! - **[`UnitCombatStats`]** from the self player's [`ObjectStore`] — the stat/resistance/
//!   damage/attack-power fields (all OWNER_ONLY, verified streamed in 0208) plus the three resolved
//!   skill pairs: the app picks WHICH skill line the equipped main-hand/ranged item uses
//!   (`weapon_subclass_skill` — vmangos `Item.cpp`'s table; no weapon = unarmed 162), reads its
//!   `PLAYER_SKILL_INFO` triplet and the Defense line's ([`SKILL_DEFENSE`]), so the engine-free
//!   bindings just serve the pairs.
//!
//!   The descriptor half is [`unit_combat_stats`], which any unit's store goes through — the pet
//!   paper doll's feed ([`crate::ui_pet_doll`], decision 1057) is the second caller. What
//!   [`combat_stats`] adds on top is exactly the player-only half: the four values derived from the
//!   equipped items, and the skill pairs, neither of which a creature has.
//! - **`InventorySlots`** from the inv-slot guids → [`Items`] objects → templates → the
//!   [`ItemDisplays`] icon — index 0 the ammo slot (`PLAYER_AMMO_ID`, its count summed across the
//!   backpack + the four equipped bags), 1..=19 the equipment slots, 20..=23 the four equipped-bag
//!   ICONS (decision 0216 slice 2's bag bar — the bag item itself, `INV_SLOT` 19..22, not its
//!   contents), all by the client's `GetInventorySlotInfo` ids. A slot whose template answer is
//!   still in flight carries its `item_id` with `icon: None` and fills on a later frame (the
//!   ask-once cache repaints via `UNIT_INVENTORY_CHANGED` when the view changes). Each equipment
//!   slot (1..=23) also carries an `|Hitem:…|h[Name]|h` `link`, its `PendingItemOps`-derived
//!   `locked` (decision 0208 phase 1b — the doll twin of `ui_items::feed_containers`'s bag-slot
//!   `.locked`), and its resolved `equip_slots` (`ui_items::find_equip_slot` over the item
//!   template's `inventoryType` — the cursor arc's "fit rule", decision 0216/0218).
//! - **The paper-doll booth yaw**: the pane's `Model:SetRotation` transcription writes the VM-side
//!   value ([`UiScript::paperdoll_yaw`]); the feed mirrors it onto [`PaperDollBooth`] so the booth
//!   re-bakes at the new facing (decision 0208 §5).
//!
//! Events, fired on snapshot transitions (grouped by the ref's own registration set,
//! `PaperDollFrame.lua:14-28` — arg1 `"player"`): `UNIT_STATS`, `UNIT_RESISTANCES`, `UNIT_DAMAGE`,
//! `UNIT_ATTACK_SPEED`, `UNIT_ATTACK_POWER`, `UNIT_RANGED_ATTACK_POWER`, `UNIT_RANGEDDAMAGE`,
//! `UNIT_ATTACK` (the weapon-skill pairs) — [`fire_stat_transitions`], shared with the pet feed —
//! and `UNIT_INVENTORY_CHANGED` on any slot-view change. A first snapshot counts as a transition of
//! every group (the `ui_unit` rule).
