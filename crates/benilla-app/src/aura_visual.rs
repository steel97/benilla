//! **The aura-state CharProc layer** — what an aura does to the *body itself*: its translucency, its
//! tint and its animation clock, for exactly as long as the aura lives. This is the half of a stage-2
//! "state kit" that
//! isn't an attach-point emitter (those are `creature_anim::spell_visual`'s
//! [`arm_aura_state_fx`](crate::creature_anim::arm_aura_state_fx), decision 0393): where that
//! watcher hangs *models* on the unit, this one changes how the unit's own model **renders**.
//!
//! B114 ("Stealth shows nothing on the character") was this whole layer missing. Stealth's state
//! kit carries no effect models and no anim at all — its entire visual is one CharProc — so the
//! effects-only watcher resolved the kit, found an empty slot list, and dropped it on the floor.
//!
//! ## The mechanism (VERIFIED — wow-re `ghost-death-visuals.md` §2, `state-kit-aura-lifecycle.md`)
//!
//! `UNIT_FIELD_AURA` slot change → the aura watcher `0x604d00` → `0x6123f0` → **`0x5ff350`
//! PlayAuraStateVisual**: the slot's spell → `Spell.dbc` → `SpellVisual` → **field 4 = the state
//! kit** → `PlaySpellVisualKit(kit, stage 2)`, whose tail (`0x60f358: push esi(kit);
//! 0x60f35c: call 0x60d7c0`) runs the **CharProc dispatcher** over the kit's four proc slots
//! (`SpellVisualKit` fields 15–34 — `benilla_formats::CharProc`). Two of the dispatcher's nine cases
//! act on the body:
//!
//! - **proc 14 = translucency** (`0x60d972`): the param becomes a node keyed by spell id
//!   (`node+0x18`, value at `node+0x78`), linked at the HEAD of the unit's list `unit+0xb50`. The
//!   unit's effective alpha is then recomputed by `0x60d180` as **`baseAlpha × the head node's
//!   factor`** — at most one node term, never a product over the chain (wow-re
//!   `base-render-alpha.md` §4, correcting this note's earlier `Π` gloss) — `baseAlpha` from the
//!   vtbl+0x6c getter `0x60d2d0` (`CreatureDisplayInfo+0x14 × 1/255`, the SAME slot in the unit
//!   and player vtables: "players 1.0" was the data talking, not a type fork — §6) — and handed
//!   to **`0x614f80` StartAlphaFade(target, 1000 ms)**, the same ramp block (`+0xec..0x100`) and
//!   the same `clamp01(t)³` ease (`0x614a90`) our appear-fade already rides
//!   ([`benilla_world::model_fade::fade_alpha`]). Per frame `model+0x180 = master × fade`
//!   (`0x614baa → 0x710cb0`), which multiplies into the per-batch alpha (`0x707680`).
//!   The recompute has a second, aura-free caller: the DISPLAYID watcher's refresh (`0x60abe0 →
//!   0x60ad9f`), which is how a display whose row says `CreatureModelAlpha < 255` — Ghost Wolf's
//!   4613 = 102 — renders translucent by itself; [`refresh_base_alpha`] is that leg.
//! - **proc 1 = tint** (`0x60d840`): `round(param)` is a packed `0x00RRGGBB` OR'd with `0xff000000`
//!   into a tint node (list `unit+0xce0`); per frame the head node goes `×1/255` into
//!   `model+0x184/188/18c`.
//!
//! Removal is the mirror image: the aura leaves the slot → `0x5ff290` drops that spell's nodes and
//! recomputes, so the alpha **ramps back** to the new target over the same 1000 ms.
//!
//! The vis-flag is a decoy and must not be used here: `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_1` byte 3's CREEP (stealth)
//! and GHOST bits drive **no** body render at all — an exhaustive census of every `+0x213` reference
//! found three sites, all nameplate/marker suppression (wow-re `ghost-death-visuals.md` §1). The two
//! co-travel only because the server sets the flag and the aura from the same spell. Keying the body
//! off the flag would be the wrong mechanism that happens to look right on stealth and then fails on
//! every other member of the family.
//!
//! ## The shipped data (read from the real 5875 `SpellVisualKit.dbc` this session —
//! `benilla-extract charprocs` censuses it)
//!
//! 185 of 1772 kits carry a CharProc, and the **state** stage is far and away their home: 103 state
//! kits, ~1200 (spell, proc) pairs. Proc 14 covers **11 kits / 135 spells** — kit 312 `0.3` is the
//! whole sneak family (Stealth 1784-1787, Prowl, Vanish, Shadowmeld, Hide, Sneak, Disguise), kit
//! 3450 `0.5` is Invisibility/Fade, kit 989 `0.5` the ghost aura, 3129 `0.65` Shadowform, 1286 `0.3`
//! Banish, 3989 `1.0` Possess, 5129 `0.0` a quest fade-out. Proc 1 covers 73 state kits (~800
//! spells): Frostbolt's chill blue, Immolate's ember orange, the poison green.
//!
//! ## What is built here, and what is not
//!
//! **Proc 14 ships whole** — nodes, the `baseAlpha × head node` target, the 1000 ms cubic ramp both ways,
//! and the render composition below.
//!
//! **Proc 1 ships too** (decision 0812): its nodes live here ([`AuraNodes::tint`], head-node-wins as
//! the reference's `unit+0xce0` list is) and [`apply_aura_tint`] publishes the head to
//! [`benilla_world::instance_tint`], the per-instance modulate channel keyed on the part's rig slot. Written
//! on change, never eased — the reference's own asymmetry (`unit+0xd04` change-detection straight to
//! `0x710cf0`, with none of the alpha's 1000 ms ramp).
//!
//! 0806 recorded this as blocked on a render-architecture call between per-unit material clones and a
//! tag-indexed palette. That framing was wrong on its own terms: the `MeshTag` rig field already IS a
//! per-instance slot into the shared light buffer, so the tint needed **no** new tag bits (which was
//! the whole stated blocker — the payload has 5 spare bits outdoors and zero indoors) and no material
//! churn. What it did need was reading our own renderer properly.
//!
//! The tint reaches a unit **whole** — the reference's `0x714000` recursion, where an attached model
//! composes onto its parent CM2's computed colours — by two routes, because benilla has two kinds of
//! attached model:
//!
//! - the ordinary one **borrows its wearer's slot**: an item's parts, cards and boneless geosets all
//!   spawn carrying the unit's instance bits (decision 0820), so they read the unit's table entry;
//! - a **rigged** one carries its OWN slot, because the vertex stage indexes the skin palette with
//!   that same field and cannot borrow it (a spell-effect instance; since 0841, the seven shoulder
//!   models that weld geometry to a billboard bone). [`chained_tint`] walks such an instance's
//!   [`benilla_world::model_fade::ParentModel`] link up to the unit — the recursion itself, and the same walk
//!   `ModelAlphas` already does for alpha.
//!
//! **Proc 11 ships too** (decisions 0889 + 0891): the **freeze**. Its param is a playback *rate*
//! written onto the unit's own animation clocks (`0x60db7e` → `SetBoneAnimSpeed 0x712910` on the
//! mount's bone 0, the body's key-bone 4 — the upper-body split — and the body's bone 0), old rates
//! saved in the node and written back when it expires (`0x6203e0`). Rate 0 is Ice Block: the pose
//! holds exactly where it was, *including* a cast one-shot that had just been armed, which is why the
//! caster never gets to raise their hand. [`apply_aura_anim_rate`] is that leg — and it expresses
//! rate 0 as a **pause**, not as a speed, because the reference's rate belongs to a bone while a speed
//! here belongs to a clip that other code copies from ([`AnimRateFreeze`] carries the story).
//!
//! Types 2, 7 and 13 also appear on state kits (Berserk/Bloodlust's 2, the Sap/Feign-Death 7, the
//! "Glowy (Red)" 13) and have **no verified mechanism** — they fall through [`node_for`]'s single `_`
//! arm, which is where each lands as one match arm the day its RE returns.

/// hypothetical: the night-elf eye glow — two additive `…EYEGLOW.BLP` quads at head height — went on
/// burning in mid-air after the body it belongs to had faded out (ledger B71), and a stealthed night
/// elf with full-brightness eyes is the same bug wearing this system's clothes. Cards are picked up
/// by the same rule the self-avatar feather uses: test the card's follow-anchor against the walked
/// set. One multiply covers both halves — the card dims with the body, and for an ADD blend the
