//! The app-side **inspect feed** (decision 0631) — the bridge that turns another player's PUBLIC
//! descriptor into the slot views the inspect window's Lua reads.
//!
//! The `CanInspect`/`CheckInteractDistance` distance map used to be fed from here too, back when it
//! held popup tokens only and only for players. It is unit-general now (B304) and lives with the
//! other unit-token feeds — `crate::ui_unit::feed_unit_reach`.
//!
//! This is [`crate::ui_char`]'s pattern turned onto a *foreign* unit, and the difference between
//! the two is the whole reason this module exists rather than a flag on that one:
//!
//! | | the character window | the inspect window |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | source | `PLAYER_FIELD_INV_SLOT_*` guids (PRIVATE) | `PLAYER_VISIBLE_ITEM_*` entries (PUBLIC) |
//! | resolves via | item **objects** → templates | templates only |
//! | so it can show | counts, durability, locks, creator | icon, name, quality |
//!
//! Other players' inventory guids are server-private, so there are no item objects to read — the
//! visible-item entry is the only path (`entities::equipment`'s header records the same finding for
//! rendering their gear). That is exactly why the reference's inspect paper doll shows no stack
//! counts and no durability: the client has none either.
//!
//! Three jobs, each frame, before the VM ticks:
//!
//! - **Drain the intents.** `NotifyInspect(unit)` → resolve the token to a player guid → send
//!   `CMSG_INSPECT` and latch the token as the inspect target. `ClearInspectPlayer()` → drop it.
//!   The window does not wait for `SMSG_INSPECT` (it carries only the echoed guid, and the ref
//!   paints immediately) — the request exists because server-side it also sets our selection.
//! - **Resolve the view.** While a target is latched: re-resolve the **token** each frame (so the
//!   window follows a re-target exactly as the ref's does, `InspectFrame_OnEvent`'s
//!   `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` arm), then read the 19 visible-item entries → the ask-once item
//!   template cache → icon/name/quality/link, and push it on change. A slot whose template answer
//!   is still in flight carries its `item_id` with `icon: None` and fills on a later frame, the
//!   `ui_char` rule.
//! - **Point the booth.** The `"inspect"` body booth ([`InspectBooth`]) gets the resolved entity
//!   and the pane's yaw, so it bakes the inspected player's dressed look (decision 0631 §4).
//!
//! Events, fired on transitions for the **inspected token** (the ref's own registration set,
//! `InspectPaperDollFrame.lua:2-5` + `l.82`): `UNIT_INVENTORY_CHANGED` when any slot view changes,
//! and `UNIT_LEVEL` when the unit's level does. A first resolve counts as a transition (the
//! `ui_unit` rule).
