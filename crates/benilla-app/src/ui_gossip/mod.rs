//! The app-side **gossip feed** (decision 0081 phase 3) — the inward half of the gossip seam around
//! [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `gossip` module, the exact twin of [`crate::ui_items`]'s container seam.
//!
//! The net bridge fills [`GossipState`] from the wire (`SMSG_GOSSIP_MESSAGE` → options + an ask-once
//! `CMSG_NPC_TEXT_QUERY` for the greeting; `SMSG_NPC_TEXT_UPDATE` → the greeting; `SMSG_GOSSIP_COMPLETE`
//! → cleared). Each frame [`feed_gossip`] turns that state into a [`GossipMenu`] snapshot, pushes it
//! into the VM ([`benilla_ui::script::UiScript::set_gossip`]), and fires `GOSSIP_SHOW` on open (or a
//! content change while open — the NPC's name resolving) / `GOSSIP_CLOSED` on clear.
//! [`drain_gossip`] pulls the Lua intents back out: `SelectGossipOption` →
//! [`ClientCommand::GossipSelectOption`] (mapped through the wire option `index`; coded options are
//! guarded, never sent — decision 0081), and `CloseGossip` → a local clear (vanilla's client-side
//! close sends no packet; verified against the 1.12 opcode set — there is no `CMSG_GOSSIP_CLOSE`).
//!
//! **The menu opens only with its greeting resolved, and the hold fires nothing** — a first visit
//! to a text id keeps the frame exactly as it was for the query round trip: hidden if it was
//! hidden (never options over an empty page — B292, decision 1508), and **still painted with the
//! previous menu if it was open** (a sub-menu's first visit repaints in place when its text lands,
//! never hides and re-shows the window — decision 1994). Both are the reference's own law,
//! VERIFIED at the bytes (wow-re `gossip-npctext-law.md` §1/§4): on a cache miss `0x4e2010` sets
//! its select latch and returns — no greeting write, no event — and its greeting write and
//! `GOSSIP_SHOW` are adjacent and unconditional on the one success path, so "gossip frame open
//! with a blank greeting" is not a reachable state, and neither is "gossip frame hidden by a
//! pending reply". [`GossipState::text_pending`] is the latch; [`feed_gossip`] fires nothing
//! while it holds; [`GossipState::open_menu`]/[`GossipState::text_arrived`] are the two wire
//! edges that set and resolve it.
