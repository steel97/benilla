//! The **layout cache** — where the windows the player has moved or resized are, so they are still
//! there after a relog.
//!
//! The engine has carried the client's userPlaced bit for a long time
//! ([`benilla_ui::script`]'s `movable` cluster — `frame+0xb4 & 0x1000`, set by `SetUserPlaced` and
//! by the drag entries themselves) and **nothing read it**: a chat window dragged across the screen
//! went back to its authored anchor at the next login. This module is the half that was missing.
//! The engine half — enumerate, restore, dirty-bit — is `benilla_ui::script`'s `layout_cache`; this
//! is the two ends the VM cannot own: *where the file lives* and *when it is written*.
//!
//! ## The file, and how it relates to the reference's
//!
//! 1.12 writes `WTF/Account/<ACC>/<REALM>/<CHAR>/layout-cache.txt`, and a real one off the pinned
//! install reads, in full:
//!
//! ```text
//! Frame: ChatFrame2
//! FrameLevel: 4
//! X: 32
//! Y: -578
//! W: 430
//! H: 120
//! ```
//!
//! Ours is `benilla-config/layout/<realm>-<character>.txt`
//! ([`crate::local_state::layout_character_path`]) — the same scope, one folder flatter, with that
//! file's `Frame:`/`W:`/`H:` spellings kept. **Two of its keys are deliberately different, and both
//! are about benilla's own move model rather than about taste:**
//!
//! - **`Point:` lines instead of `X:`/`Y:`.** The reference collapses a dragged frame to a single
//!   screen-space position and re-seats it from a `TOPLEFT` anchor; benilla's drag pump keeps the
//!   frame's authored anchor SET and shifts every offset in it (the divergence `movable`'s own doc
//!   states). Writing an absolute pair would therefore *lose* what the drag produced — ChatFrame1
//!   is anchored `BOTTOMLEFT` to UIParent, and restoring it as a TOPLEFT position would change how
//!   it follows a resolution change. So the file carries what `GetPoint` answers, one line per
//!   anchor: `Point: <point> <relativeTo> <relativePoint> <x> <y>`, with `-` for the screen root
//!   (which is where `GetPoint` answers `nil`).
//! - **No `FrameLevel:`.** The reference persists it because an undocked chat window is raised
//!   above its neighbours and that raise has to survive; benilla's raise is transient and its
//!   docked windows share one level. It joins the file the day a window can be raised for good —
//!   the honest-tree rule (1134 §4), the same one the chat-look file applies next door.
//!
//! ## The write posture — [`crate::ui_chat`]'s `settings`, verbatim
//!
//! Dirty flag keyed to the VM ([`VmMemo`]), one quiet second, plus both session edges
//! (`OnExit(InWorld)` and `AppExit`). The VM key is the load-bearing part and it is one-way: the
//! geometry lives in the VM, so a plain `bool` surviving a VM replacement would let a save compose
//! the player's file out of a fresh tree that has no user-placed frame in it at all — i.e. wipe it.
//! A fresh VM starts undirty and cannot write until a drag writes.
//!
//! A drag is a slider-shaped gesture, so the debounce matters for the same reason it does there:
//! a resize writes on every mouse-move, and the quiet second coalesces the lot into one file write.
