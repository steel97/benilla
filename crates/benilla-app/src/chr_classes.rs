//! `ChrClasses.dbc`, loaded once and read by everything that asks the client a question about a
//! class.
//!
//! Three consumers today and they are unrelated to each other — [`crate::ui_pet_book`] wants field
//! 4's pet name token, `UnitHasRelicSlot` wants field 16's relic flag, and
//! [`crate::spell_mods`] wants field 15's class spell-family — which is exactly why the
//! table does not live inside any of them. It used to live in the pet book, back when the pet
//! token was the only column anyone read.
//!
//! The resource is **absent**, not empty, when the load fails. Every reader then falls to the
//! reference's own degraded answer (`"PET"` for the token, no relic slot for any class, family 0
//! — which the modifier gate's first conjunct refuses), so a missing table costs a warlock the
//! word "Demon", a paladin their relic branches and everyone their talent modifiers rather than
//! taking the client down.
