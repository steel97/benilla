//! The app-side **dressing-room feed** (decision 1060): the bridge between the window's intents
//! (`BenillaDressUpModel_Dress/TryOn/Close`, [`DressUpIntent`]) and the booth's look
//! ([`DressUpPreview`]).
//!
//! Three jobs, each frame, before the VM ticks ([`UiInput`]):
//!
//! - **Apply the intents, in order.** `Dress` drops every substitution (the ref's
//!   `SetUnit("player")` on open and `Dress()` on Reset); `TryOn(id)` records one; `Close` empties
//!   the room. Order matters — `DressUpItem` resets *then* tries on in the same breath.
//! - **Resolve each tried-on item to a display.** An item id is all a `|Hitem:` link carries, so the
//!   display id / inventory type come from the ask-once template cache
//!   ([`Items::template`] — `CMSG_ITEM_QUERY_SINGLE` on a miss, exactly as the reference's
//!   ItemCache does). A substitution whose answer is still in flight stays **pending** and lands on
//!   a later frame: that is the normal case for an item the player has never seen, e.g. one linked
//!   in chat by someone else.
//! - **Compose the look.** The player's own body + appearance + their `PLAYER_VISIBLE_ITEM_*`
//!   displays, with each resolved substitution written into the slot its `InventoryType` maps to
//!   (the shared [`equip_slot`] table — the same one the glue/select preview dresses by, so a robe
//!   lands on the chest here exactly as it does there). The **held** triple then goes through
//!   [`held_lanes`], which is where the two previews stop agreeing: the character-select mannequin
//!   drops the ranged slot and this window puts it in a hand (decision 1076). 1060's own record
//!   claimed "a wand in the ranged hand here exactly as it does there" — that was wrong in the
//!   second half, and the ranged slot was silently discarded until 1076.
//!
//! **What is NOT here:** any notion of *fit*. The reference's dressing room previews whatever it is
//! handed — a plate helm on a mage, a mail chest on a rogue — because it is a look, not an equip:
//! `DressUpItemLink` reaches `TryOn` with no class/level/proficiency check anywhere in the path
//! (`DressUpFrame.lua:2-16`). Ours does the same.
