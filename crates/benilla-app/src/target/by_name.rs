//! Selection **by name** — the shared resolver behind `/target` and `/assist` (decision 0886).
//!
//! The reference has ONE resolver, `0x493aa0`, parameterised per caller; `/target`, `/assist` and
//! `/follow` are the same search with different arguments (wow-re
//! `object-layer/scratch/targeting-by-name.md`, §5-cross-checked):
//!
//! | binding | typemask | filter mode | exact-only |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `TargetByName 0x489d60` | 8 = UNIT (creatures **and** players) | 0 | Lua arg #2, never supplied |
//! | `AssistByName 0x489c40` | 0x10 = **PLAYER only** | 0 | hardcoded 0 |
//! | `FollowByName 0x489ec0` | 0x10 = PLAYER only | 2 (`CanAssist` + alive) | Lua arg #2 |
//!
//! **Filter mode 0 is the whole point of the shape**: it underflows `0x493e40`'s jump table
//! (`dec eax; cmp eax,3; ja`) into the default arm `mov eax,1; ret 4` — *accept unconditionally*. So
//! by-name selection has **no** range limit, **no** facing cone, **no** dead/reaction/attackability
//! test, **no** scene-attach visibility gate, and **no** self-exclusion. It is a far wider net than
//! TAB ([`super::scan`]), which shares none of those defaults. `/target <your own name>` self-targets
//! in the real client, and so does it here.
//!
//! ## The comparison — two tiers, both case-insensitive
//!
//! 1. **Whole-string** (`0x64a4c0` → CRT `0x414310`, which folds both operands in its own bytes).
//! 2. **Longest common PREFIX** (`0x493cb6`-`0x493cf6`), anchored at index 0 — a prefix, never a
//!    substring. Live whenever the second Lua argument is absent, which is every shipped call site,
//!    so `/target Rag` really does select "Ragnaros". The running best length starts at **1**, so one
//!    folded character of overlap is enough to enter the ranking — and a query sharing no first
//!    letter with anything matches nothing.
//!
//! Within one prefix-length class the tie-break is the **strictly nearest** 3D centre-to-centre
//! dist² (the reference's `fcomp`/`jp` edge is a strict `<`, so ties keep the incumbent).
//!
//! ## The one deliberate deviation — and why
//!
//! In the reference a tier-1 whole-string hit **returns 0 from the walk callback, terminating the
//! enumeration** (`0x493ca2`, stopped at `0x4683b7`). Two consequences fall out, both
//! enumeration-order dependent: among several identically-named creatures the client takes
//! *whichever the ClntObjMgr table walk reaches first* — never the nearest — and a near "Bobby"
//! recorded before a far "Bob" beats it outright for the query `Bob`.
//!
//! **We do not reproduce the early-out**, and since 0886 was written the order it depends on has
//! been derived, so the choice is now made against a known reference rather than an unknown one.
//! Table #1 is an intrusive doubly-linked list (link field at `obj+0x38`, written by the ctor at
//! `0x4650c2`) whose insert is a **tail append** (`0x4646c3`-`0x4646d4`), so the walk runs
//! **oldest-linked first** — and "linked", not "spawned": a unit that streams out and back in is
//! re-appended to the tail. The reference's tier-1 pick is therefore *the same-named candidate that
//! has been continuously known longest*, which no client-side heuristic reproduces without modelling
//! the list itself.
//!
//! [`Rank::beats`] is instead a **total order** — exact beats any prefix, then longer prefix, then
//! strictly nearest — which is deterministic and picks the nearest of several same-named kobolds.
//! wow-re's note calls the reference behaviour here "the single behaviour most likely to look like a
//! bug in a reimplementation". Reproducing it is now *possible* (stamp each net entity with a
//! monotonic link sequence, re-stamped on stream-in, and order the walk by it); it is not done
//! because nearest is the better answer, not because the order is unknown. This is the one place to
//! change if that judgement is ever reversed.
//!
//! ## Not carried
//!
//! The reference pre-scans the **party** (`0x493b20`) and **raid** (`0x493b9d`) rosters before the
//! object walk, matching group members against the guid-keyed name cache at a sentinel distance of
//! 2.5e9 — so a groupmate with no streamed object is still selectable. benilla cannot hold a
//! guid-only selection at all yet ([`Selection::target`] is an `Entity`; the same gap already
//! no-ops `TargetUnit("partyN")` on an out-of-range member, see [`super::click`]), so the pre-scans
//! wait on that slice rather than being half-built here.
