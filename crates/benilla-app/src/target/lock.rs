//! The GameObject **lock chain** — the client's resolver `0x5f83d0`, its per-slot **Action** gate
//! (`0x5f81d0`), and the §8.8 refusal-toast routing (decisions 0239 / 0545 / **0752**).
//!
//! **One chain, two consumers — exactly as the reference.** `CGGameObject`'s per-type strategy
//! calls the same resolver twice: from **`usable` `0x5f3130`** (which decides the cursor's grayed
//! twin *and* whether the right-click is sent at all — §4a/§8.7), and from the **USE sender
//! `0x5f33e0`** (which picks between `CMSG_GAMEOBJ_USE`, an `OPEN_LOCK` cast, and a client-local
//! toast — §8.4). That is why it lives here rather than inside either caller: the icon and the
//! click agree by construction only if they ask the same question.
//!
//! ## The Action gate — the piece that was missing (0752)
//!
//! Before the resolver will *consider* a `Lock.dbc` slot it asks `0x5f81d0(GO, Action[i])`, which
//! answers from the GameObject's own **state** and its `GO_FLAG_LOCKED` wire bit — see
//! [`benilla_formats::LockSlot::available`]. Without it, the ladder is over-permissive in a way
//! that looks arbitrary from the chair: nearly every keyed door in 5875 carries a spare
//! `Quick Open` slot (`LockType 10`, `Skill 0`, **`Action 0`**), *every* character knows spell 6247
//! "Opening", and Action 0 means "only when the object is NOT flagged locked" — so skipping the
//! gate hands every padlocked door in the game to every player. The Searing Gorge gate (lock 84)
//! was the one that refused because it is the one that carries no `Action 0` slot.
//!
//! ## Satisfaction is the SPELL's value — and the value's level term IS the player's skill
//!
//! `0x5f850f` compares the matched spell's own OPEN_LOCK **effect value**
//! ([`benilla_formats::SpellDisplay::open_lock_skill`]) against the slot's requirement — which is
//! `Skill[i]`, or **`GAMEOBJECT_LEVEL × 5`** when `Skill[i]` is zero (`0x5f84be`). The sentence
//! that used to stand here — "it never reads the skill block" — was `cursor-system.md` §8.8's
//! absolute, and wow-re REFUTED it at the bytes (`openlock-spell-store-order.md` §4a,
//! 2026-08-14): the value's level term routes through the CGPlayer vtable (`0x6e384d → 0x6e3130
//! → [vtbl+0xa8] = 0x5ea690`) into `PLAYER_SKILL_INFO` for the spell's own SkillLineAbility
//! line ([`spell_skill_value`]). At skill cap the two readings coincide (`skill/5 == level`),
//! which is how the old one survived every at-cap cross-check while a level-60 with 1 Mining
//! satisfied a 300-skill vein (decision 1320 named the bug; this module now carries the fix).
