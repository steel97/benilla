//! **Who may I attack, who may I interact with, who may I help** — the three unit-relationship
//! predicates the reference shares across systems, kept together because they are one concern and
//! none belongs to the system that happens to call it first.
//!
//! The first two are byte-verified **complete** functions and live next door in [`super::ring`],
//! beside the two reaction directions they turn on — because *which direction* is the whole
//! content of both (`0x6061e0(this = player)` answers a reputation-slot faction with the **at-war
//! bit**; `0x6061e0(this = unit)` reads the standing, and the two routinely disagree). This file
//! is the shared store-only entry point every consumer calls:
//!
//! - `CanAttack 0x606980` → [`super::ring::can_attack_from_player`],
//! - `CanInteract 0x6067f0` → [`super::ring::can_interact_from_player`],
//! - `CanAssist 0x6066f0` → still the reaction-rank derivation below, on [`ring_reaction`].
//!
//! They lived in `scan.rs` while `can_attack` had exactly one caller; `can_assist` (the `UnitBuff`
//! gate, decision 1035) made that a second concern in a file about TAB targeting.

/// no duel, PvP flag or FFA pair. `/reaction` prints this beside the `NetEntity` kind so the first
