//! The ground selection ring — a projected decal under the current target, reaction-coloured.
//!
//! **Geometry: the reference's own mechanism** ([`project_ring`], wow-re selection-circle RE — the
//! collector is byte-verified terrain + WMO, flags `0x200122`, no walkability test): the actual
//! surface triangles inside the ring's box — terrain tiles + WMO faces
//! ([`GroundDecalSurface`]), **never** doodads/GameObjects — clipped to the box and textured
//! top-down, so the ring is pixel-coplanar with the visible ground, drapes down steps/ledges like
//! the reference, and passes *under* props. (A Bevy `ForwardDecal` was rejected: it distorts at
//! WoW's steep camera angle and its depth-prepass broke clutter. An earlier per-vertex height-probe
//! grid was replaced by this — a height field can't represent ledge faces and spiked on them.)
//!
//! **Texture + blend**: the reference's own `UnitSelectTexture.blp`, additive, **not** pulsed (the
//! reference's pulsing circle is a separate spell/AoE indicator). The baked alpha fade (bright arc,
//! fading tail) is oriented **camera-relative** each frame ([`ring_fade_angle`]): the bright arc
//! faces the viewer, the fade points away — the reference decal's behaviour (its projector
//! transform is camera-fed).
//!
//! **Colour: the ring's own selector** (`CGUnit::GetSelectionCircleColor` `0x605960`, trace + byte
//! verified — NOT the nameplate palette): players branch to pale blue / hostile red; NPCs to
//! dead-gray or the reaction-rank palette (red / orange / yellow / green) — see
//! [`RingMaterials::pick`]. The reaction rank resolves in the client's own order
//! ([`ring_reaction`]): **reputation rank first** (a reputation faction's NPCs colour by our
//! standing with them), else the faction-template comparator
//! ([`benilla_formats::FactionTemplate::reaction_toward`], the byte-exact `0x606640`), evaluated as
//! the **unit's** reaction toward the local player (byte-verified direction). Death **clears the
//! target** on the alive→dead transition — the reference's own mechanism, byte-verified (wow-re
//! selection-death-clear RE): the health mirror's death edge fires the CGUnit death handler
//! (`0x605860`), which clears a matching selection and sends `CMSG_SET_SELECTION 0`.
//!
//! Still *interim*: the vertical fade profile on stretched (wall/ledge) pieces is capture-matched —
//! the reference's edge-fade grid (`0x6147f0`) is byte-located but its ramp is underived (open RE
//! item). The ring appears at full brightness the instant of selection — director-verified and
//! byte-confirmed (the retracted "2 s selection fade-in" note was a misread of the *scale-change*
//! easing, see [`crate::net::NetEntity`]; no fade arms on any selection path). The selector's
//! **first-priority branch** — the melee combat flash (`[unit+0xc58]` bit 0x10, the red↔orange
//! triangle pulse) — is live: [`super::CombatFlash`] carries the frame's verdict + colour and
//! outranks every branch below (player/dead/reaction), the byte order. The player path's party
//! legs are live (0434 phase 6 — pale blue / pale green off the roster). Deferred selector
//! states: the full PvP attackability matrix (X/Y), forced reactions, contested-guard.
