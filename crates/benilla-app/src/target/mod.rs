//! Targeting — click a unit to select it, and mark it with a ground selection ring.
//!
//! The first real player-facing consumer of the [`crate::interact`] picking foundation (whose header
//! long anticipated "mouseover-targeting"). This module owns the *selection state and input*; the
//! ring itself — the projected decal, its colour selector, and the reaction decode — lives in
//! [`ring`]. The pieces here:
//! - **Selection state** ([`Selection`]) — the entity + guid of our current target, tracked *locally*
//!   and set the instant we click (the faithful client behaviour: the ring appears immediately, no
//!   server round-trip). Sending [`ClientCommand::SetSelection`] just informs the server, which records
//!   it in our `UNIT_FIELD_TARGET` and relays it to observers.
//! - **Hover** ([`hover::update_hover`]) — each frame, the unit under the cursor, found the way the real
//!   client finds it (wow-re pick-volume RE `bd630be`, §5-verified: `CGWorldFrame` pick `0x481190` →
//!   `0x7089c0`): a **broad phase** ray-vs-sphere on the *current animation sequence's* bounds
//!   (world-placed + scaled, no pad), then a **narrow phase** ray-vs-triangle against the unit's
//!   **posed render mesh** — the drawn vertices skinned through the live joint pose. Clickable =
//!   the visible creature's silhouette at its pose. (The M2 bounding-triangle block is *not* the
//!   unit pick volume — that's the static-doodad path; an earlier gloss saying otherwise was
//!   refuted by asset data.) Hull-less/model-less units (cube fallbacks) keep the old render-mesh
//!   AABB test. Stored in [`Hovered`] — the state a mouseover highlight will read.
//! - **Click to select** ([`select_on_click`]) — a [`WorldClick`] (the clean left-click the player
//!   controller emits; a left *drag* orbits the camera instead) selects whatever is [`Hovered`].
//!   Clicking empty ground / a non-unit, or pressing **Esc**, clears the target; the target's death
//!   clears it too (in [`ring::update_ring`], where death is already read).
//!
//! The mouseover/target "light-up" has two consumers: the per-model **emissive lift**
//! ([`highlight`], the byte-verified additive term) and the V-plate's reaction-tinted **glow**
//! (`crate::vplates`, drawn later off [`Hovered`] + [`Selection`]). The plate rect is itself part
//! of the pick: hovering a plate makes its unit the mouseover *before* any world ray-test
//! ([`hover::update_hover`] consults `crate::vplates::PlateRects` first — the reference's
//! UI-blocks-world frame walk), so plates brighten the model and take clicks like the body does.
//! The real pick's **world-occlusion clamp** is modelled ([`PickOcclusion`]): the reference's scene
//! trace runs `CWorld::Intersect` first and the object pick only wins nearer than the world hit —
//! a unit or GameObject behind a wall is not hoverable. Not yet modelled: the header-sphere
//! fallback for a sequence with unauthored bounds (we pass the broad phase through instead —
//! strictly more permissive, never less).
