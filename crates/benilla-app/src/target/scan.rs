//! TAB / nearest-enemy targeting + combat auto-target — the **Classic-priority selection**
//! (decision 0567) over the 1.12 wire laws.
//!
//! The 1.12 byte algorithm (±30° cone about the *character's* facing, cone-first-then-nearest
//! sort, 10-yd out-of-cone bubble, snapshot list + cursor cycling — wow-re
//! `object-layer/scratch/targeting-nearest-and-autoacquire.md`, §5-verified twice) was
//! implemented faithfully, live-reproduced, and then **replaced at the director's call**: the
//! authentic law skips a close mob that fills your screen (at 2 yd the cone is ~±1 yd wide, and
//! the camera sits ~9 yd behind — "right in front of my cam" is routinely 40°+ off the
//! character axis), and its snapshot cycle walks into behind-you mobs. Blizzard hit the same
//! wall and rewrote targeting for Legion 7.2 — the system Classic Era ships. We follow that
//! design, pinned from the Classic binary's own cvar-description strings (statically recovered;
//! the code section is packer-encrypted) and the 7.2 patch note:
//!
//! - **Screen-space tiering** — a candidate whose projected point lands inside the camera
//!   frustum with each screen edge pulled in (`TargetPriorityFrustumPullIn{Sides,Top,Bot}`:
//!   "Percentage towards center to pull in [edge] of the screen for in-view checks") is a
//!   tier-1 ("100% correct") pick; off-screen candidates are reachable **only when no
//!   on-screen candidate exists** (`TargetPriorityAllowAnyOnScreen` = 1 semantics).
//! - **A weighted score, not a lexicographic sort** (`TargetPriorityValueBank`): screen
//!   off-centerness + normalized distance − an "attacking me" bonus; lowest wins.
//! - **A fighting-me score bonus, not Classic's hard combat lock**: units attacking me outrank
//!   everything peaceful, but TAB can always walk off them onto a fresh target. Classic's
//!   `TargetPriorityCombatLock` (pool restricted to in-combat units) was implemented and then
//!   retired by the director's feel — decision 0568: with a single attacker it pinned TAB to
//!   that mob with no way off.
//! - **History cycling, no snapshot cursor** (`TargetPriorityHighlightHistoryMs` — "time target
//!   history should be maintained for repeated activations"): every press re-scores the live
//!   world and skips recently-tabbed guids; exhausting the pool clears the history (the wrap).
//!   Shift-TAB steps back through the history. A clicked target joins the history when tabbed
//!   away from (`TargetPriorityContinueFromManualTarget`'s observable).
//!
//! The **numbers** here (pull-in margins, weights, the history window) are tunable stand-ins —
//! Blizzard's defaults live in the encrypted code section; each const names its cvar so a later
//! pin (the director's in-game `GetCVarInfo` dump) slots straight in. Not modeled, disclosed:
//! `TargetPriorityUpdateDelay` (a timer-refreshed list feeding the hold-to-highlight preview we
//! don't have — per-press rebuild covers selection), `TargetPriorityAutoTargetIgnoreWindow`,
//! `AllowAnyOnScreen=2` (out-of-range picks), PvP weighting, and the 7.2 note's
//! character-OR-camera visibility union (we test the camera only).
//!
//! **What stays byte-law from 1.12** (wire/data semantics, unchanged): the validity filters
//! (dead / [`can_attack`] `0x606980` / CreatureType flag-bit-0 critters), the [`commit`]
//! stop→select→re-swing SetSelection law (`0x493540`), attack-with-no-target acquiring the best
//! candidate and swinging (`0x612df0` @ `6130b5`), and the ATTACKERSTATEUPDATE auto-acquire
//! (`6259c9`–`6259fe`). The 41-yd range keeps 1.12's `targetNearestDistance` default — Classic
//! still ships that cvar ("limited to tab targeting range").
