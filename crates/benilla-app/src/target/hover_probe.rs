//! **The headless hover probe** (decision 2250) — aim the mouseover pick from a screen point when
//! the window has no OS cursor of its own, and say what the pick found.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! An automated run **cannot hover anything**. The rig's probe window (640×360, corner-parked,
//! always-on-top) never receives the OS cursor: `Window::cursor_position()` stays `None` through a
//! `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` *and* through HID-level `mouseMoved` events posted into its content
//! rect, so [`super::hover::update_hovered_object`] returns before the pick on every frame. The
//! consequence is not subtle — every report of the shape *"this object shows no tooltip"* has had to
//! be settled by the director hovering it and reading the card back to us, because the pick was
//! reachable only by a person with a mouse (2248 recorded that gap; this closes it).
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! `WOW_HOVER_PROBE` names where to aim, in the window's own cursor space (logical px, y-down):
//!
//! | value | aim |
//! |---|---|
//! | `centre` / `center` | the window's middle |
//! | `<x>,<y>` | that point |
//! | `sweep` | a 7×5 grid across the middle half of the window, one point per frame, cycling |
//! | `lock` | sweep until something is picked, then HOLD that object for the rest of the run |
//!
//! `sweep` is the one that makes a rig run useful without a camera: standing a body in front of a
//! known object and asking *"what is anywhere near the middle of the screen"* answers the question
//! a fixed point can only answer if the aim was already right. It is a probe, not a camera search —
//! the grid is fixed, bounded and the same every run.
//!
//! **`lock` is what a resting pointer looks like, and `sweep` cannot stand in for it** (2255). A
//! sweep re-enters the object every cycle, and a *re-enter* is precisely what rebuilds the
//! mouseover plate — so a whole class of defect, the one where a plate that is already up never
//! comes back after something else takes the tooltip, is invisible to a sweep by construction. It
//! is also what a fixed `x,y` cannot do: the camera settles over the first seconds of a rig run and
//! the object slides across the screen, so a hand-aimed point that hit at 30 s misses at 60 s.
//! `lock` holds the hit POINT IN THE OBJECT'S OWN FRAME and re-projects it every frame, so the aim
//! follows the object through camera drift and through the object's own motion. It never releases:
//! that is the point — it stands for a pointer a person put down and left there.
//!
//! **Armed only when the window reports no cursor**, so an attended run is never overridden: a
//! person's pointer always wins, and leaving the variable set costs a player nothing.
