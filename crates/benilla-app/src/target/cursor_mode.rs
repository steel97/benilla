//! The context-sensitive **world cursor** — the classifier half (wow-re cursor RE, note
//! `ui/scratch/cursor-system.md`, §3 per-bit service table + §5 gates, all byte-verified).
//!
//! Each frame, the hovered unit resolves to a [`CursorKind`] the way the real client's
//! `CGWorldFrame` classifier does (`0x4828d0` → unit branch `0x482200`):
//! - an **interactable NPC** (service flags, not hostile) → the `UNIT_NPC_FLAGS` service ladder
//!   (`0x482336..0x4824e3`), lowest bit wins — the full statically-unrolled map is
//!   [`service_cursor`]. Notably vendor → **Pickup** (the pouch), innkeeper → **Interact**,
//!   banker/auctioneer → **Buy**; REPAIR (0x4000) is *never consulted* — a repair-only unit falls
//!   through to the attack/clear leg (real repairers all carry VENDOR too).
//! - otherwise **loot / skin / attack** keyed on state: dead + `UNIT_DYNFLAG_LOOTABLE` →
//!   **Pickup or LootAll** — the loot leg's mode is `8 + (keyDown(0) ? 8 : 0)` (`0x48252c`):
//!   the triple-pouch LootAll(16) while the auto-loot modifier is held, generalized since 0961's
//!   auto-loot to the EFFECTIVE state (`autoLootDefault` XOR shift — [`loot_cursor`]); dead +
//!   `UNIT_FLAG_SKINNABLE` → Skin; alive and attackable → Attack.
//! - **`Unable*` (grayed) by a different gate per mode** (byte-verified): NPC services gray beyond
//!   **5.5556 yd** (`0x482320`); attack beyond a fixed **10.45 yd** (`0x4826a7`); skin outside the
//!   melee interact reach `max(reachA + reachB + 1.333, 5.0)` — the 5.0 is a **floor**, not a cap
//!   (`0x6e3480` for skin; the same formula inline in `CanLootNow 0x5ec110` @ `0x5ec142..0x5ec1c8`
//!   for loot, center-to-center, boundary-inclusive — director-measured ~5 yd, byte-confirmed).
//!   Loot *rights* never gray — they gate whether the loot cursor shows at all; the mid-loot state
//!   block and the open-loot-window able-override are not modeled.
//!
//! *Interim*: the reference's interactability predicate (`CGUnit::CanInteract 0x606880`) isn't
//! fully derived; we approximate it as "has service flags and isn't attack-worthy (reaction ≥
//! neutral)". Attackability approximates the PvP/attack matrix as "reaction rank ≤ neutral" —
//! the same approximation the ring's player branch documents. (The questgiver bit's own
//! quest-status gate, `0x5df490`, and the auto-loot Pickup/LootAll split, `0x41f8f0`, both used
//! to be listed here as unmodelled; both are modelled now — [`questgiver_has_quest`],
//! [`loot_cursor`].)
