//! The app-side **questgiver feed** (decision 0088) — the inward half of the quest seam around
//! [`benilla_ui::script`]'s `quest` module, the twin of [`crate::ui_gossip`]/[`crate::ui_merchant`].
//!
//! The net bridge fills [`QuestGiver`] from the wire: `SMSG_QUESTGIVER_QUEST_LIST` → the greeting
//! panel, `_QUEST_DETAILS` → the accept panel, `_REQUEST_ITEMS` → the progress panel,
//! `_OFFER_REWARD` → the reward panel, `_QUEST_COMPLETE` → the turn-in result (closes the window),
//! and `SMSG_QUESTGIVER_STATUS` → the per-guid dialog-status store (world markers are a later
//! slice — decision 0088). Each frame [`feed_quest`] resolves the open view into a
//! [`QuestState`] snapshot (item names via the ask-once template cache, icons straight from the
//! wire display id — the merchant's pattern), pushes it ([`UiScript::set_quest`]), and fires the
//! matching FrameXML event (`QUEST_GREETING`/`QUEST_DETAIL`/`QUEST_PROGRESS`/`QUEST_COMPLETE` on a
//! panel change, `QUEST_ITEM_UPDATE` on an in-place content change, `QUEST_FINISHED` on clear).
//! [`drain_quest`] pulls the Lua intents back out and maps each to a `CMSG_QUESTGIVER_*` addressed
//! to `(npc, questId)` from the open view.
