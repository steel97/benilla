//! **Camera shake** — the thump a heavy creature's footfall puts through the camera, the one-off
//! jolt as its body lands, and the jolt a spell effect puts through it (B298; decisions 1540/1849).
//!
//! **Four producers, two id spaces, one evaluator.** Every producer ends at the same spawner —
//! `AddShake(id, worldPos)` (`0x511d40`), whose five call sites are the whole population (proven by
//! xref sweep, wow-re `spell/scratch/camera-shake-producers.md` §Q4: no address-dword reference to
//! it anywhere, and no Lua, console, cinematic or quake path).
//!
//! The **creature** pair names a `CameraShakes.dbc` preset **directly**:
//!
//! - **`CreatureModelData.FootstepShakeSize`** (field 11) → fired from the **visual** footfall
//!   channel — the per-foot plant tags (`$FL0`/`$FR0`/`$RL0`/`$RR0`…), the same stream
//!   [`crate::footprints`] reads. **Not `$FSD`**, which is the sound handler's alone.
//! - **`CreatureModelData.DeathThudShakeSize`** (field 12) → the same table, fired on `$DTH`.
//!
//! The **spell** pair names a `SpellEffectCameraShakes.dbc` **group** — up to three presets at one
//! point ([`benilla_formats::SpellShakeGroup`]):
//!
//! - **`SpellVisualKit` field 14** (`kit+0x38`, the `ShakeID` column) → once per kit play, via
//!   [`SpellKitShake`] and [`fire_kit_shakes`], which carries the mechanism and the one deviation.
//! - **the `$SHK` animation event** → its payload *is* a group id, fired ungated at the event's own
//!   bone-transformed point ([`event_point`]).
//!
//! **`$SHK` is decoded by exactly two handlers**, hanging off the GameObject (typemask `0x20`,
//! `0x5f3e20`) and DynamicObject (`0x40`, `0x5d58c0`) trampolines — the dword `0x4b485324` occurs
//! twice image-wide, and of the six dispatchers `0x7133a0` registers only those two decode it.
//! **`CGUnit_C::HandleAnimEvent` is not one of them**, so a `$SHK` on a creature M2 logs
//! `UNHANDLEDANIMEVENT` and does nothing — which is not academic: CryptLord and Thunderaan both
//! author markers on their death/emerge clips and the reference plays neither. That gate is why no
//! creature shake can be `$SHK`-driven, and it is enforced in [`fire_shakes`].
//!
//! Only 25 of the 430 shipped models carry a footstep shake, and the set is exactly the
//! thumping-giant list; 49 carry one of the two, and 58 of the 1772 kits carry a shake group. See
//! `benilla-extract shakecensus`, which maps all four producers onto the 24 presets.
//!
//! ## The law (wow-re `ui/scratch/camera-shake-law.md`, §5-verified)
//!
//! **Emission — the footstep**, gated in this order (`0x5fbf70`): not hovering · `BYTES_1` byte 3
//! bit `0x2` clear (our stealth bit) · not a player-ghost · **`|camera − footplant|² ≤ 2500`
//! (50 yd)**. The shake sits *outside* the `showfootprints` CVar gate and *outside* the 25 yd gate
//! that follows it, so it reaches twice as far as a footprint decal and does not turn off with
//! them. The position is the planted foot's world point, exactly as the decal derives it.
//!
//! **Emission — the death thud** (`0x625c30`): **no gates at all** — no hover, no ghost, no
//! distance, no CVar — at the unit's own world position.
//!
//! **Per live record, per frame** (`0x511760`/`0x5116e0`):
//!
//! ```text
//! t = (now − start) + phase                 // seconds; phase is a TIME pre-roll, not an angle
//! if !(t < duration) → retire
//! A = amplitude / 36                        // the DBC column is inches; yards on the wire out
//! d² = |eye − pos|²                         // pos is snapshotted at spawn
//! if d² > 6400 → contribute nothing (the record survives)
//! if d² >   81 → A *= 0.7^((√d² − 9) / 9)
//! a = A · sin(2π · frequency · t)
//! if shake_type == 1 → a *= exp(−coefficient · t)
//! ```
//!
//! Three corrections to the conventional column map, all from the consumer: **`Phase` is a time
//! pre-roll in seconds**, not an angle — it advances the sine *and* the decay, and shortens the
//! real life to `duration − phase`; **`Duration` is a hard cutoff with no taper**, so a
//! `shake_type == 0` row is cut off mid-swing at full strength; and **`ShakeType` is a one-bit
//! decay switch**, not a type — `== 1` exactly enables the `exp` envelope, and `Coefficient` is
//! that rate in 1/s and is dead data on every `shake_type == 0` row. The decay is base **e**.
//!
//! **What moves.** A pure world-space **translation of the eye** — no rotation, no FOV change; the
//! look-at target is rebuilt as `eye + forward`, so it rides along. `Direction` selects an axis in
//! the **followed unit's body frame**, re-read every frame, which is why turning the player
//! rotates an in-flight horizontal shake:
//!
//! | `direction` | reference (WoW axes) | ours (Bevy) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | `(a·cos φ, a·sin φ, 0)` | `a ·` forward |
//! | 1 | `(−a·sin φ, a·cos φ, 0)` | `a ·` left |
//! | 2 | `(0, 0, a)` | `a ·` up |
//!
//! (`bevy = (−wow.y, wow.z, −wow.x)` — decision 0002 — and our yaw about `+Y` equals the WoW
//! facing, so axis 0/1 land exactly on the unit's forward/left.) **Every creature row is
//! `direction = 2`**, so in practice a footstep shake is purely vertical; the other two axes are
//! reachable only from the spell-side table and are implemented for completeness. Axes 0 and 1 are
//! *not* independent — both sum into the horizontal plane.
//!
//! **Combination.** Three slots, one per axis, each keeping the single strongest live shake — same-axis
//! shakes do **not** sum, the losers are dropped outright, and at most three shakes play in a frame.
//! This is what a spell **group** is shaped for: its three slots name the `direction` 0·1·2 members
//! of one preset family, so they land on three different axes and all three contribute. They are
//! slots and not axes, though — group 4 is `15 · 14 · 15`, and the duplicate loses the tie-break.
//! Ties keep the incumbent, and the walk is oldest→newest, so ties keep the **older** record.
//!
//! **Lifetime.** A record holds a *snapshot* position and no reference to its source, so a shake
//! fully outlives the creature that spawned it. The whole evaluation is skipped — offset zero,
//! nothing expiring — while the **followed unit** (the far-sight subject when there is one, our own
//! body otherwise) is **swimming** or riding a **fly-or-swim spline**: the reference's two suspend
//! gates, both of which jump the same block.
//!
//! Not modelled, deliberately: the reference's second wholesale free on `SetTarget(nullptr)`, and
//! its destructor's unlink-without-free (a shipped leak — our `Vec` cannot reproduce it).
