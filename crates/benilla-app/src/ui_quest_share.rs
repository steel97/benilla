//! **Party quest sharing** — the *Share Quest* button's two answer paths (decision 1733).
//!
//! Everything about a share that is not already the questgiver panel's job lives here, and that
//! turns out to be exactly the two things the sharer's own client cannot see: what each party
//! member *did* with the quest, and — for an escort quest — the confirm box a member gets when
//! somebody else starts it.
//!
//! **What is NOT here, deliberately.** The receiving half of an ordinary share needs no code of its
//! own: the server sends the receiver a plain `SMSG_QUESTGIVER_QUEST_DETAILS` whose giver guid is
//! the *sharer's player guid* (vmangos `QuestHandler.cpp:450`), so the shared quest arrives on the
//! questgiver panel already built, and Accept answers it with the ordinary
//! `CMSG_QUESTGIVER_ACCEPT_QUEST` addressed to that player. [`crate::ui_quest`] needs to know a
//! share from an NPC offer for exactly two things — the decline packet and the range guard — and it
//! reads both off the giver guid's own type bits ([`benilla_protocol::guid::is_player`]).
//!
//! **The two flows, and why one resource holds both.** They are one server-side latch
//! (`Player::SetQuestShareInfo` — one `{sharer, quest}` pair per player, set by the push and by an
//! escort accept alike), so a client that modelled them separately would be modelling one thing
//! twice.
//!
//! 1. **The verdicts.** `MSG_QUEST_PUSH_RESULT` comes back to the SHARER, once per member and
//!    usually twice (`SHARING_QUEST` when the push goes out, then the outcome). Each is an
//!    `ERR_QUEST_PUSH_*_S` line naming the member — `%s`-filled from the guid in the packet, which
//!    is the member the verdict is *about*, never the sharer (the direction trap on
//!    [`benilla_protocol::messages::QuestPushResult`]).
//! 2. **The escort confirm.** `SMSG_QUEST_CONFIRM_ACCEPT` arrives when a party member starts a
//!    `QUEST_FLAGS_PARTY_ACCEPT` quest. It raises `QUEST_ACCEPT_CONFIRM(memberName, questTitle)`,
//!    the reference's own event (`UIParent.lua:353` → `StaticPopup_Show("QUEST_ACCEPT", arg1,
//!    arg2)`); Yes calls `ConfirmAcceptQuest()`, and **No sends nothing at all** — which is why
//!    there is no decline command here.
//!
//! **A name we do not have yet holds its line — a NAMED divergence, not fidelity.** Both paths
//! address a party member by guid and display a *name*, so both go through the [`NameCache`]'s
//! ask-once resolve. The reference does not: it reads the object-name cache `0xc0e228` through
//! `0x55f080` with a **null callback**, so a miss returns 0 and the message is **silently dropped**
//! — no query, no defer, no line (decision 1738's §5). That is a quirk of a synchronous object
//! manager that always has its party members to hand, not a behaviour worth reproducing: benilla's
//! cache may genuinely not hold a member yet, and losing "Thrall has declined your quest" because a
//! name query was in flight is strictly worse than showing it a frame later. So a verdict whose
//! name has not landed is kept and retried, with [`crate::ui_loot`]'s bounded budget so a guid the
//! server will never name cannot pin a line forever. [`crate::ui_duel`] takes the same divergence
//! against the same reference behaviour, and says so in its own header.
