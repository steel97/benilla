//! The **display-facing counter-twist** — the client's strafe/look body pose (wow-5875-re
//! `body-facing-pipeline.md` §3, the `0x607ed0` tail → the `0x711f10` bone channels).
//!
//! A unit's rendered root yaw can sit *offset* from its aim — a strafe turns the root toward the
//! slide (±90° pure, ±45° diagonal) while the aim (camera, server orientation) holds. The client
//! then counter-rotates two key-bone subtrees back toward the aim, proportional to the remaining
//! gap: **SpineLow (KeyBoneID 4)** takes half the gap capped at 45°, **Head (KeyBoneID 6)** takes
//! the remainder capped at 45°. For a pure 90° strafe that composes to: hips/legs fully at the
//! strafe heading, shoulders counter-twisted back ~45°, and the head landing *exactly* on the aim
//! (45° + 45° = 90°) — nothing tuned, the arithmetic closes. The gap owner ([`crate::player`]'s
//! controller for our avatar, [`crate::net::motion`] for remote movers) writes [`BodyTwist::yaw_gap`];
//! the [`apply_body_twist`] system composes the twist onto the animated bone locals each frame,
//! after Bevy's animation evaluation and before transform propagation.
