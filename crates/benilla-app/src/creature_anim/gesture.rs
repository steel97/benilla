//! The **client-local gesture** — the second producer of a one-shot emote, and the one benilla was
//! missing (bug B157, decision 1469).
//!
//! Nothing on the wire announces it. The real client's chat *display* path picks a gesture code from
//! the message itself and calls `0x60bb30(unit, code)`; that resolves the code through a five-slot
//! table of `Emotes.dbc` rows and hands the emote id to `0x5fcd20` — the **same** function
//! `SMSG_EMOTE`'s handler calls, and the only one in the whole client that turns an `Emotes.dbc` id
//! into a played animation. So the gesture is not a new animation path: it is a new *producer* for
//! the one benilla already has ([`super::EmoteAnim`]). A client that only reacts to `SMSG_EMOTE`
//! plays nothing at all, which is exactly what was reported.
//!
//! The same dispatcher has a second caller — the **NPC-interact** path, always with code 0 (talk) —
//! which is why [`crate::target::click`] pushes through here too instead of writing a raw AnimID.
//!
//! Byte-exact spec: wow-re `object-layer/scratch/chat-talk-gesture.md`.
