//! The melee **impact-frame deferral** — the client's swing-hit timing, §5-verified end to end
//! (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/melee-impact-timing.md`, f86e665a; the victim-consequence table
//! `smsg-attackerstate-consequences.md`, ffd0b016): at SMSG receive, a locally resolved attacker
//! caches the swing record (`attacker+0xd70`), plays the swing clip (rate 1.0, `0x5fe2f0`), and
//! does **not** dispatch the victim. When the clip's playhead crosses an authored **`$AH0–3` or
//! `$CAH`** event keyframe (rel ~300–670 ms in every shipped attack clip; the `$AH` digit picks a
//! sound column only), the event kernel fires `0x6247d0 → 0x624530(victim, attacker+0xd70)` — all
//! four victim elements at the impact frame — and clears the record (fires once). **`$HIT` never
//! reaches the dispatcher** — it is a CEffect-model tag that re-fires only the wound flinch, and
//! it also rides hit-REACTION clips, so matching it would fire pending swings at wrong moments.
//!
//! Two more consequences ride the same event router (decision 0279):
//!
//! - **`$CPP` — the victim DEFENSE animation** (`0x624a01`): a defended outcome (dodge/parry/
//!   block/deflect) plays a dedicated primary clip on the victim ([`DefenseAnim`]) and **clears
//!   `HitInfo & 0x2` in the cached record** (`and [esi+0xd80],-3`), suppressing the wound
//!   flinch + blood for that hit. The record itself survives `$CPP` — so `$CPP` before the
//!   impact tag defends and then texts/sounds, while an impact tag first **consumes** the record
//!   and a late `$CPP` finds nothing: the two are mutually exclusive per authored event order,
//!   exactly the client's shape.
//! - **The whiff slow-down** (`0x624ca0` → `0x712910(bone 0, 0.5f)`): a swing that contacted
//!   nothing (victimState ∈ {0 miss, 2 dodge, 6 evade}) drops the attacker's own swing to HALF
//!   speed for its remainder ([`SwingSlowdown`]) — a slowed follow-through, not a cut.
//!
//! The record law (byte-verified): **one slot per attacker, overwrite** — a second swing before
//! the first impact supersede-flushes the old record as **floating text only** (blood/flinch/sound
//! drop); `SMSG_ATTACKSTOP` (also how death/stun arrive) flushes the same way; a resolved attacker
//! whose clip has **no** impact tag never fires the full set — the client drops, it does not fall
//! back to a timer. The only receive-time victim dispatch is an attacker that doesn't resolve at
//! all (`net/apply`'s direct [`SwingImpact`] write).
//!
//! benilla's twin: [`route_swing_impacts`] caches each [`SwingMessage`], consumes the first
//! matching tag from the [`AnimSoundEvent`] stream, and emits [`SwingImpact`] — full on the tag,
//! `text_only` on supersede/attack-stop. Consumers: blood + flinch + the contact sounds
//! (`sound::combat`, decision 0529) skip `text_only`; the floating number takes all.
