//! The Bevy driver: [`drive_animations`], which executes the state machine [`super::select`]
//! picks, reading and writing [`super::AnimDriver`]'s private state. Kept in its own file as it
//! carries the bulk of the per-frame Bevy system logic, separate from the module face ([`super`])
//! and the pure selector logic ([`super::select`]). Split into a small family of children — the
//! playback primitives ([`play`]), the wound-flinch secondary-blend slot logic ([`wound`]), the
//! per-hand weapon-grip overlay ([`grip`]), and the base track's **mode machine** ([`mode`]) —
//! with this file the stable face, re-exporting [`grip::drive_hand_grip`] unchanged.
//!
//! What is left here is one function, [`drive_animations`], and it is a *sequence of phases* over
//! one unit, not a set of concerns: the prologue that computes the frame's facts, the death
//! override, the mount transition edge, the sheath state, the one-shot gather-and-arm, the mode
//! machine (now [`mode`]), the rate write, the fades, the trace, the wound, the sheath reconcile.
//! The phases share ~20 live bindings and a handful of frame-local flags, so they do not come
//! apart on a module boundary the way the four children did — decision 0933 records which cut was
//! taken, which was not, and why.
