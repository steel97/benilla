//! Bridge a bridged **anim** emote (`SMSG_EMOTE`) into the general one-shot player
//! ([`super::EmoteAnim`]): resolve its `Emotes.dbc` id to an `AnimID` through the shared sound
//! catalog ([`EmoteSounds`], promoted from `crate::sound`, decision 0070 slice 4) and hand off —
//! after the **receive-side posture gate** ([`receive_eligible`]).
//!
//! **Verified against vmangos** (`/Users/sam/wre/vmangos-src/src/game/Handlers/ChatHandler.cpp`
//! `HandleTextEmoteOpcode` + `src/game/Unit.cpp` `Unit::HandleEmote`/`HandleEmoteCommand`,
//! 2026-07-03): a one-shot text emote (`/wave`, `Emotes.dbc EmoteType == 0`) sends **both**
//! `SMSG_TEXT_EMOTE` (the chat line + voice — `EmoteKind::Text`) and `SMSG_EMOTE`
//! (`HandleEmoteCommand` — `EmoteKind::Anim`) from the *same* handler, keyed on the *same*
//! `Emotes.dbc` id (`EmotesTextEntry::textid` **is** the `Emotes.dbc` foreign key
//! `EmotesText.EmoteID` — the id `SMSG_EMOTE` then carries). So consuming only `EmoteKind::Anim`
//! here is complete for `/wave`-style emotes (no need to also key animation off
//! `SMSG_TEXT_EMOTE`) and never double-fires: one player action yields exactly one `SMSG_EMOTE`,
//! hence exactly one [`EmoteAnim`]. The looping state emotes (sit/sleep/kneel, `EmoteType != 0`)
//! instead go through `Unit::HandleEmoteState` — a `UNIT_NPC_EMOTESTATE` field write, no
//! `SMSG_EMOTE` at all — so they never reach this consumer; they're the state-emote idle in the
//! gait layer instead ([`super::select::is_bare_stand`]).
//!
//! **The receive-side gate is `EmoteFlags`-BLIND** (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/emote-posture-
//! gate.md`, commit `f9584b45`, §2): the real client's `SMSG_EMOTE` handler (`0x5e66b0`) never
//! reads the `Emotes.dbc` record at all — it suppresses only on the performer's own state, **stand-
//! state == 3 (SLEEP)** or the **swim move-flag**, and nothing else (no sit check, no flags check).
//! This is why a *seated* `/clap` still plays for observers though a seated `/bow` never even sent
//! the packet (the send-side gate in `crate::ui_chat` stopped it there): the two gates are different
//! and independent. [`receive_eligible`] mirrors exactly this predicate — do not add an EmoteFlags
//! test here.
