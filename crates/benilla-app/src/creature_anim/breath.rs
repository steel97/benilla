//! **Cold breath** — the visible vapour a unit puffs from its mouth in a cold zone (B233,
//! decision 1149; wow-re `object-layer/scratch/cold-breath-law.md`, §5 two independent pairs +
//! byte arbitration).
//!
//! The client hangs three mutually-exclusive puffs off one animation event, and they are the
//! `$BTH` family: cold vapour, underwater bubbles, and the drunk's bubbles. This module owns the
//! **cold** one — the only one of the three that was reported missing, and the only one whose
//! every input benilla already has.
//!
//! ## The mechanism, in the order the client runs it
//!
//! 1. **The classifier** `0x607710` — `CGUnit_C` vtable slot 14, run per frame from the
//!    WorldFrame's visible-object callback, on **every unit with a loaded model** (NPCs and
//!    creatures too; there is no local-player gate anywhere in it). It **clears both**
//!    `[unit+0xc58]` bits at entry and then sets **at most one**: `0x20` submerged, `0x40` cold.
//!    It stamps `[unit+0xc18] = now + 10 s` on every leg, so **the classification is cached for
//!    ten seconds per unit** — crossing a zone border does not take effect instantly.
//!    [`classify_breath`].
//! 2. **The cold test** `0x67e9c0` — `AreaTable.Flags` bit `0x1`, inherited ONE hop from the
//!    parent zone unless the leaf sets bit `0x2`. That single hop is the whole mechanism: only
//!    four rows in 5875 author the bit (Dun Morogh, Winterspring, Razorfen Downs, Naxxramas) and
//!    every sub-area a player actually stands in carries `0x40`, so a leaf-only read finds
//!    nothing anywhere. [`benilla_formats::AreaTableCatalog::is_cold`].
//!    It is **independent of the weather** — snowfall and breath share no input — and there is no
//!    indoor suppression: the Thunderbrew Distillery is as cold as the road outside.
//! 3. **The handler** `0x5ffbd0` — on the `$BTH` anim event, the ladder
//!    `drunk ≥ 50 → underwater → cold → nothing`, strictly exclusive. [`fire_breath`].
//! 4. **The puff** — `SpellVisualEffectName` row 107 `"HARDCODED Breath Cold"` →
//!    `Particles\ColdBreath.m2`, attached at **M2 AttachmentID `0x11`** (a bone under the head —
//!    key bone 21, whose pivot is the mouth), inheriting the bone's full orientation. The asset
//!    is emitter-only (no mesh): one non-looping 1.5 s sequence, one continuous particle emitter,
//!    zero gravity, a ~1.6° cone — a tight puff, not a spray. It self-terminates at the end of
//!    its own clip (the `0x5fbf50` one-shot terminator, the same lifetime the mount poof uses).
//!
//! **`$BTH` is authored on the whole idle family**, so the cadence is the animation's, not a
//! timer's: `Stand` and its variants, every `Ready*`, `Stun`, `Sleep`, `KneelLoop`,
//! `StealthStand`, `SwimIdle`, several emotes and `Drown` — on every player race/gender (HumanMale
//! `Stand` keys one at 667 ms), and on 148 of the 430 creature models. There is no fire-once
//! latch, so it re-fires every loop of the carrying clip.
//!
//! ## Stated divergences
//!
//! - **The underwater rung is not modelled** — but it is now fully specified rather than open:
//!   what is missing is the work, not the law (`cold-breath-law.md` §4b). The test is
//!
//!   ```text
//!   underwater ⟺ 5.0 + SCALE_X · boxHeight < liquidSurfaceZ − unitZ
//!   ```
//!
//!   where `boxHeight` is the M2 header's **box A** — `bounding_box_max.z − bounding_box_min.z`,
//!   the loose all-animation render box at MD20 `0xb4`, raw model space
//!   (`benilla_m2::M2Header::bounding_box_min`/`_max`). Emphatically **not** the collision box and
//!   not `CreatureModelData.CollisionHeight`: those are the *other* box (`0xd0`) and agree with
//!   each other, not with this one. `SCALE_X` is the only multiplier — no DBC scale enters.
//!   `unitZ` is the unit's **feet** (its movement-block position), and `liquidSurfaceZ` is the
//!   ordinary liquid query's own cached surface, not a second sample.
//!
//!   For a scale-1 HumanMale that threshold is **8.84 yd** of water above the feet (box A `Δz` =
//!   3.8415); DwarfMale 8.03, GnomeFemale 7.11, TaurenMale 10.21; a unit whose model has not
//!   loaded uses the ctor default `1.0`, i.e. 6.0. **So it is a diving test, not a swimming one**,
//!   and that is what bounds the omission: a unit in a cold zone puffs vapour where the reference
//!   would puff bubbles only once genuinely deep. The bubbles themselves
//!   (`Particles\Bubbles.m2` — 3.3 s and *looping*, so they need the replace-on-respawn dedup
//!   this module's one-shot does not) are a separate, unreported feature. Two details for whoever
//!   builds it: while **mounted** the box is the MOUNT's model, and `SCALE_X` runs through a 2 s
//!   cosine ease after a scale change (bit-exact at rest, so only that window differs).
//! - **The drunk rung gates but does not spawn.** `drunk ≥ 50` correctly suppresses cold breath
//!   (the ladder is exclusive); the inebriated bubbles themselves are unreported and their clip
//!   semantics are unpinned, so nothing is drawn there.
//! - **A remote unit's area is the terrain's alone.** The player's area comes from
//!   [`CurrentArea`], which races a WMO interior claim ahead of the terrain chunk exactly as the
//!   client's `GetAreaID` does; there is no per-unit equivalent of that claim, so other units
//!   read [`area_id_under`]. It differs only inside a WMO whose `WMOAreaTable` row names a
//!   different area than the ground beneath it.
//! - **Overlap is refused rather than replaced.** The client's `0x6208e0` destroys a still-running
//!   puff when a new one spawns on the same unit at the same tag; our one-shot instances carry no
//!   reap key, so [`fire_breath`] declines a new puff while the last one is still inside its clip
//!   instead. Same observable — never two overlapping puffs — with the running one finishing
//!   rather than restarting.
