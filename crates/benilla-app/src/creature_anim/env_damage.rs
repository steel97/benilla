//! Environmental-damage feedback — the fall-landing dust puff and pain grunt (decision 0412,
//! byte-verified wow-re `object-layer/scratch/smsg-environmentaldamage.md`). Two independent
//! sources fire it, matching the reference's own double-fire:
//!
//! 1. **The wire arm** (`net/apply`): `SMSG_ENVIRONMENTALDAMAGELOG` → [`EnvDamageTable`] maps the
//!    damage type (0 exhausted · 1 drowning · 2 fall · 3 lava · 4 slime · 5 fire) to a
//!    `SpellVisualKit` id, played on the victim through the ordinary discrete kit play
//!    ([`super::KitPush`] → `PlaySpellVisualKit` `0x60edf0`). This is the *unconditional tail* of
//!    the reference's 0x1FC consequence method `0x624f30` (fires for any resolved unit; the
//!    floating damage number + self-only chat line are the method's other two legs, not modeled).
//!    The server sends no sound with it — `0x624f30` plays no vocal at all.
//!
//! 2. **The client-side landing predictor** (`0x602d00`, the movement tick's *other* caller of
//!    `0x624f30`): on a hard landing the client plays the unit's wound vocal (class 2 →
//!    CreatureSoundData) AND re-fires the *same* fall kit locally with damage 0 — without waiting
//!    for the server. So a damaging local fall shows the puff twice (predicted, then echoed an
//!    RTT later) and the grunt is heard immediately. The metric is **fall height in yards**
//!    (`0x7c60c0`), gated at [`HARD_LANDING_DESCENT`]. The vocal leg lives in [`crate::sound`]
//!    (it owns the voice catalog); the dust leg is [`hard_landing_dust`] here; both gate on the
//!    same descent.
//!
//! **Deliberate scope (decision 0412):** benilla drives the predictor from the *self* controller's
//! landing edge only — remote movers' landings aren't detected yet, though the reference fires it
//! for any mover (its call graph reaches `0x602d00` from the networked movement handler). And the
//! HARD gate's immunity modifier (feather-fall / safe-fall auras force SOFT in the `13 < h < 70`
//! band; `h ≥ 70` bypasses it) isn't modeled — those auras aren't tracked, so every fall past the
//! floor reads HARD, which is the common case.
