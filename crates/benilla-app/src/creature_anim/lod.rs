//! The animation-LOD gate (decision 0448): park an off-frustum — or, since decision 0739,
//! portal-invisible — rig's **per-bone pose evaluation**, keep **every clock** running. Since
//! 0739 it governs the whole [`RigPose`] population — units, players, AND GameObject rigs (see
//! the query's comment for why the old `With<AnimDriver>` filter left every animated GO
//! sampling off-view).
//!
//! 0448 shipped this as a modernization against a reference that "has NO view cull on unit
//! skeletons" — a verdict wow-re REFUTED on 2026-08-13 (`outdoor-object-pass-election.md`: every
//! scene object, units included, is frustum/horizon/room-elected each frame, and a pass-2 unit
//! is neither drawn, nor animated, nor event-ticked — except creatures flagged `MORE_AUDIBLE`,
//! re-linked for tick only). So this gate turned out to be the *faithful* direction, not a
//! departure; what still diverges is decision 1473's ledger — parked rigs keep DRAWING (the
//! election never reached draw submission), and observable (ii) keeps every unit audible where
//! the reference keeps only the flagged ones. The two observables preserved here:
//!
//! - **(i) the absolute-clock snap** — faithful (`0x714260` samples the world clock): a
//!   re-appearing unit shows the pose "now" dictates. Nothing here pauses an [`AnimationPlayer`]:
//!   Bevy's `advance_animations` keeps ticking every seek clock, so waking is just sampling
//!   again — there is no frozen state to resume from.
//! - **(ii) off-screen combat is audible for `MORE_AUDIBLE` creatures — and only them**
//!   (decision 1482, the tick half of the election): a parked rig's event tracks are not
//!   scanned ([`super::events::fire_anim_events`] skips it, memory and all), except when its
//!   cached creature template carries the `0x20` flag — the reference's `0x607da0` re-link arm.
//!   The driver state machine still arms clips for every parked rig (pose correctness on wake —
//!   the memo design of 1370 item 9 is the only safe skip there), so a flagged creature's
//!   `$CSS`/`$CAH`/`$HIT` (0075), `$BWP`/`$BWR`, and `$CSL` (0430) fire off-screen exactly as
//!   the reference's do.
//!
//! The park mechanism is the [`AnimParked`] marker alone (decision 0712 — the evaluator took over
//! from `animate_targets`, and the old per-joint `AnimatedBy` repoint died with the targets): the
//! pose evaluator ([`super::pose`]) skips a parked rig, so its bone `Transform`s stop changing,
//! which quiets transform propagation and `extract_skins`' changed-joint upload by change
//! detection. The pose post-passes (body twist, global-sequence writes, billboard joint palette)
//! gate on the same marker. Contrast the DOODAD gate ([`benilla_world::doodad_anim`]), which faithfully
//! stops the player and re-arms on the shared clock — correct there (no one consumes a doodad's
//! events off-screen), the exact 0075 trap here.
//!
//! **The room leg (decision 0739).** The frustum is the wrong instrument indoors: a dungeon
//! camera's view cone passes through walls, so most of an instance's population stays "in
//! frustum" while only the current room chain is drawable. The portal PVS
//! ([`benilla_world::wmo_portal`], the faithful WMO group cull) already knows which rooms the camera can
//! reach, and [`UnitWmoRoom`] already names each unit's room — so a unit whose room (and every
//! room one portal hop from it) is outside this frame's PVS parks too. Soundness: a unit is
//! room-parked exactly when the geometry *around* it — its room's walls, floor, furniture — is
//! portal-culled by the same bits, and a body can poke only through a portal, never a wall, so
//! the one-hop guard bounds the doorway straddle. Reveals carry no artifact by construction: a
//! mob can only become visible through a portal, and the moment that portal's screen window is
//! non-zero the flood marks its room visible (`compute_wmo_pvs` runs in `Update`, this gate in
//! `PostUpdate` before the evaluator — same-frame wake, absolute-clock pose). Fail-open at every
//! seam: no claim (outdoors, EXTERIOR groups), a despawned placement, a still-loading model, an
//! out-of-range index — all read visible, the [`benilla_world::wmo_portal::WmoGroupVis::drawn_by`]
//! convention.
//! `WOW_NO_ROOM_LOD=1` disables just this leg (the A/B lever); `WOW_RIG_COST=1` prints the
//! per-frame `[rig-gate]` counters.
