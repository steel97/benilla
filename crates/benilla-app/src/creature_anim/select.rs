///   *uniform* scale — which every unit of ours is (`Vec3::splat`) — the two are identical at any
///   rotation, since row 0 is `s · (a unit row)`. `abs()` is the cheaper spelling of the same
///   number, and is only a distinction if unit scale ever stops being uniform.
/// - `CGUnit+0x94`, a spell-visual scale multiplier clamped to `[0.75, 2.0]` (1.0 when idle), is a
///   **third** factor we do not carry — because we have no producer for it: the aura CharProc
///   dispatch (`crate::aura_visual::node_for`) implements Alpha/Tint/AnimRate and nothing that
///   scales a unit. Whoever builds that layer must multiply it in here, or a scaling spell visual
///   will re-time the gait wrongly for its duration. (`CGUnit+0x98`, the fourth slot, is a literal
