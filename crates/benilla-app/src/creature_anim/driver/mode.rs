//! The **mode machine** — the `match` over [`AnimDriver::mode`] that decides what the base track
//! (bone 0) plays this frame, and the largest single phase of [`super::drive_animations`]'s
//! per-unit pass.
//!
//! It is the one phase with a clean input boundary, which is why it is the one that lifted out:
//! it reads a fixed set of already-computed per-frame facts ([`Frame`]) and writes only the
//! driver, the animation player and the transition set. In particular it touches **none** of the
//! frame-local flags the rest of the pass threads through itself (`base_played`, `masked_played`,
//! `played_oneshot`, `hold_played`, `sheath_frame_start`) — the seam is real, not just a line
//! count. The phases either side of it are not separable that way today; see decision 0933.
//!
//! The five modes and their transitions are documented on [`super::select::Mode`]; this file is
//! the executor, not the law.
