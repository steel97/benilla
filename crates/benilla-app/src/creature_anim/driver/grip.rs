/// key-bones with `HandsClosed` purely by a weapon occupying that hand's attach point). Played *over* the
/// gait on the finger-mask nodes, so the arm keeps its animation while only the fingers curl; on release
/// the fingers fall back to the base gait's flat Stand rest. Idempotent — plays only on the open→closed
/// edge and stops on closed→open, so it rides gait changes untouched (like the sheath/one-shot overlays).
