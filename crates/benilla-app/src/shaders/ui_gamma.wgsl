// The UI gamma lane's ONE decode (decision 0254) — the twin of `ffx_glow.wgsl`'s combine, which owns
// the world lane's single decode (0161) — and the client's display-gamma ramp (2182), which rides in
// front of it because the value this pass samples is exactly the byte the RAMDAC would have read.
//
// `ui_quad.wgsl` composites the whole UI in gamma bytes, like the reference's fixed-function
// backbuffer. The UI camera's target is `Rgba8UnormSrgb`, so a stored byte round-trips through the
// hardware's encode/decode and the sampler hands this pass back the gamma value the UI pass wrote.
// Emitting `srgb_to_linear` of it re-encodes on write to the exact client byte — written straight
// into the swapchain (decision 2206: the camera's output mode is `Skip`, so no blit follows).
//
// RGB is premultiplied by coverage; alpha is coverage and carries no gamma, so it passes through.
