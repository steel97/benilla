//! The **placed-doodad** animation-event scanner — the third and last producer feeding the
//! [`AnimSoundEvent`] stream, beside the creature scanner ([`crate::creature_anim`]) and the
//! GameObject one ([`crate::go_anim`]).
//!
//! Bug B345 ("every world-placed M2 doodad is silent") was this hole: a lamp's hum, a campfire's
//! crackle, a waterfall, a windmill and a gnome machine are all authored as `$DSL`/`$DSO`/`$SND`
//! keys on the model's own idle sequence — and **nothing in benilla ever wrote a doodad's events
//! into the stream**. The routing end ([`crate::sound::anim_events`]) has handled those tags since
//! decision 0070 slice 3; it simply never received one from a doodad, because the only two
//! scanners gate on `AnimDriver` (units) and `GoAnim` (server-sent GameObjects), neither of which a
//! terrain-stream placement ever gets.
//!
//! **Why it is not enough to scan the hosts that already exist.** The corpus says 273 models author
//! a doodad sound marker (`benilla-extract soundeventscan`); only 165 of them are the `FirstSeq`
//! tier that carries an `AnimationPlayer`. The other 108 — including the reported lamp,
//! `KalidarStreetLamp01.m2`, one looping 3.333 s Stand that keys no bone at all and carries exactly
//! one `$DSL` → `NightElfStreetLampLoop` — are bind-posed, and decision 0130's content gate
//! deliberately builds them no rig. That gate is right about pixels and was never a claim about the
//! clock: the reference arms **every** placed doodad it creates and cycles it whenever the doodad is
//! in the frame's animate set (wow-re `doodad-anim-host.md` §1/§4a/§5b — see the gate below). So
//! `doodad_anim::spawn_anim_host` gives a sound-carrying model a clock-only host —
//! the arm bookkeeping, no player — and this scanner reads that arm.
//!
//! **The scan is gated on the frame's ANIMATE SET, and that gate is the whole mechanism** — not a
//! budget, and not an optimisation (decision 2059). The reference's event scan `0x719370` is
//! reached from exactly one place: `0x7074b0`'s walk of the per-frame M2 scene worklist
//! `[CM2Scene+0x20]`, which is **emptied every frame** and refilled only by `0x710b90(model, 1)`
//! from the terrain doodad drain `0x683f80` — and the drain walks only the bucket the scene-walk
//! cull `0x683700` appended to, i.e. a doodad that passed frustum + horizon-occlusion **and** came
//! out of the radius-tiered horizontal distance fade with `alpha > 0`. A doodad that fails any of
//! those is not in the worklist, so its event track is never scanned, so **its `$DSL` never
//! fires and it never takes one of the emitter pool's 32 entries** (wow-re
//! `terrain/scratch/doodad-emitter-drawset-gate.md` §1b/§1c/§2b, `animation/scratch/
//! doodad-anim-host.md` §5b, `object-layer/scratch/unit-anim-visibility-gate.md` §4).
//!
//! Ungated, this scanner registered **every resident doodad in the streaming radius**, and with the
//! pool's four channels arbitrated by claim order (`super::sound::emitter_pool`) that is not a
//! harmless surplus — it is silence. Measured at the director's Stratholme pin
//! (`.go xyz 3471.91 -3366.89 136.85 329`, 2026-09-07): all four channels held by
//! `UndeadCampfireSmall` / `CauldronLoop` / `TorchLoop` / `SlimeWaterfall`, **every one of them
//! past its own `DistanceCutoff` and therefore inaudible**, while the fifth entitled entry —
//! `StratholmeFireSmokeEmberSLoop`, the burning-building layer the director reported missing, with
//! 88 emitters right there — was withheld by the cap. `0 sounding`, on the same frame that reported
//! `parked=1004`: a thousand hosts outside the animate set, each still holding its registration.
//!
//! **"A campfire behind you keeps crackling" is still true, and this gate does not break it** — but
//! by the other mechanism. A registration is released by `$DSE`, by a `$DSL` naming a different id,
//! or by the doodad's own teardown, and by nothing else (`sound/scratch/doodad-sound-emitters.md`
//! §9): turning away stops the *marker firing*, never the entry. The prose this module and
//! [`DoodadAnimHost::arm_clock`] used to carry — "the reference gates the cycle on residency, not
//! the draw" — read `doodad-anim-host.md` §5b's *linkage* as "loaded" when the note means spliced
//! into `[scene+0x20]`, which **is** the drawn/faded set ("a doodad culled out of the drain stops
//! advancing and resumes on re-link").
//!
//! The clock stays [`DoodadAnimHost::arm_clock`]'s shared one rather than the `AnimationPlayer`'s:
//! while a host is in the animate set the two agree by construction (the gate's resume seeks the
//! player to exactly this value), and the clock-only tier has no player to read at all.
//!
//! **Across a park the memory is DROPPED, not carried** — because the reference's scan window is
//! one frame wide and it never replays. `0x719370` computes `prev = max(windowLo, now − dt)` and
//! `cur = now` (`0x71950f`, for a looping sequence), **both off the absolute scene clock**, which
//! `0x7074c2` advances every frame whether or not the model is linked; a write census over the
//! whole function finds no persisted cursor. So the markers a culled doodad crossed are **lost**,
//! and what actually fires on re-link is the completion watchdog re-arming at `startOffset = 0`
//! (wow-re `doodad-sound-emitters.md` §3, corrected 2026-09-07 by the §5 round decision 2065
//! records). Keeping [`advance_track`]'s entry across the park would hand the resume frame a
//! `prev` from seconds ago and fire the whole span at once — harmless for a `$DSL` (its re-reach
//! only repositions) and a burst of one-shots for `$DSO`/`$SND`. Dropping it makes the resume an
//! **arm frame**, which fires nothing, and the frame after opens the head window `[0, cur]` — the
//! re-arm, in the shape this scanner already has.
