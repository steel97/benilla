//! **`QueryCache<K, V>` — the one ask-once cache** (decision 2288; 2265 §A4).
//!
//! The reference has one `DBCache<T>` (wow-re `system/dbcache/dbcache.md`): a consumer's miss
//! sends the query and queues a callback; a second lookup of a pending key appends a callback
//! instead of re-sending; the response handler writes the record and fires the callbacks;
//! eviction is explicit only. benilla had that machine hand-copied across eight modules under
//! three names for the in-flight set (`pending`, `querying`, `queried`), the miss and the
//! landing bodies pasted ("the exact twin of `NameCache`"), and the release that keeps an ask
//! sent before the writer thread exists from latching its key for the process lifetime written
//! for two of the eight.
//!
//! **The read that asks takes `&self`.** A miss marks itself in a lock-guarded set and sends
//! its query; the answered map does not move. That is the reason for a type over the copies: a
//! system that only *reads* a name or a template holds the owning resource shared, so two such
//! systems no longer conflict over it — 2287's "pure cache" class measured 556 such undeclared
//! orders — and Bevy's change detection on the owner means "an answer landed" again instead of
//! "someone looked" (the two hand-rolled epochs in `items.rs` were written because it did not).
//!
//! A negative answer is cached as `None` (the server's high-bit miss), so a dead key is never
//! re-asked; [`QueryCache::answered_unknown`] is for the consumer that waits (the cast-fail
//! redisplay, decision 0552) to know when to stop.
