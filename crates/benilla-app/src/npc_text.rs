//! NPC-text macros — the client-side `$`-token expansion the 1.12 wire leaves undone in every
//! server-authored text the player reads: gossip greetings, questgiver panel texts, and the quest
//! log's description/objectives (the director's screenshot showed a literal `$N` in a quest
//! description). One shared mechanism (the 0109 look fix promoted it out of `ui_gossip`); every feed
//! seam that pushes NPC text into the VM runs it — as the reference does, routing all fourteen of
//! its call sites through the one expander.
//!
//! The grammar is the reference's, carved at the bytes (wow-re `QuestTextParser.cpp`, driver
//! `0x506f70` → token handler `0x5070a0`):
//!
//! - the accepted set is **exactly** `B C E G N R T W`, in either case. Anything else re-emits the
//!   `$` and lets the letter fall through as ordinary literal text;
//! - an optional decimal prefix is scanned and consumed ahead of *every* token, but only `W`/`E`
//!   read it;
//! - **case is the output switch, not a separate token**: `$R` is the race string verbatim
//!   (`"Night Elf"`), `$r` is that same string through `_strlwr` (`"night elf"`). Same for
//!   `$C`/`$c` and `$T`/`$t`; `$N`/`$B`/`$G` are case-insensitive.
//!
//! The reference's *other* `$`-expander — spell descriptions, with its `$/N;` scale prefixes and
//! `$<spellId>` cross-references — is a different function over a different source. Ours is
//! [`benilla_formats::substitute`], kept separate here exactly as it is there.
