//! The **macros** feed (decision 0983) — the app half of `benilla_ui::script::macros`: the icon
//! chooser's catalog, persistence under `benilla/macros/`, and `UPDATE_MACROS`.
//!
//! Unlike every other window feed in this tree there is **no wire traffic here at all**. 1.12
//! macros are pure client state — no opcode carries them (vmangos has none), and the reference
//! client persists them to `WTF/…/macros-cache.txt` itself. So the engine owns the live table
//! (`benilla_ui::script::macros`' module doc says why) and this module owns its two ends:
//!
//! - **In** — the icon list (`SpellIcon.dbc`, filtered by the client's own `Spell_`/`Ability_`
//!   prefixes: [`benilla_formats::load_macro_icons`]) at startup, and the saved files at world
//!   entry.
//! - **Out** — a save whenever a script mutated the table ([`save_dirty_macros`]), plus the
//!   reference's own `UPDATE_MACROS` event on the same edge.
//!
//! The **runner** and the action-bar's **bound spell** live in [`run`]; the file format is
//! [`store`] (the reference's own, so a vanilla `macros-cache.txt` drops straight in).
