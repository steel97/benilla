//! The chat system (decision 0288), the reference's own three-stage shape: [`event`] is the
//! internal currency (`CHAT_MSG_*` typed — kinds, groups, the shipped color table); [`feed`] turns
//! every source (wire lines, channel notices, rolls, client-composed loot/system lines) into
//! events with names resolved ask-once; [`frames`] is the router + the `ChatFrame_OnEvent`
//! composer fanning lines across the docked windows; [`input`] is the outbound side (the chat
//! EditBox, the slash grammar, the send-side emote posture gate) over [`commands`]'s table of every
//! `/command` the client answers (decision 0881, built from the reference's own alias strings).
//! This face wires them into [`UiChatPlugin`] and re-exports the crate-facing API (`ChatLog`,
//! `ChatEvent`, `ChatEventKind`).
