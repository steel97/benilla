//! The **realmlist** — the address benilla dials for the logon (realmd) handshake, and the one
//! setting a player cannot start the game without (decision 1667).
//!
//! The reference client has no UI for this at all: it registers a CVar named `realmList` — help
//! text *"Address of realm list server"*, default `us.logon.worldofwarcraft.com:3724` — and loads
//! it from a plain-text `realmlist.wtf` beside the executable, which every private server's setup
//! page tells you to open in Notepad. (All four strings are byte-verified in `WoW.exe`, adjacent
//! in the string table at the CVar's registration site; wow-re `mpq/scratch/startup-order-A.md`
//! row 62 records the same registration.) benilla keeps the **name, the `host[:port]` shape and
//! the help string**, and replaces the text editor with a control on the login screen.
//!
//! **It is a CVar, in `config.toml` with every other setting — not a `realmlist.wtf` of our own.**
//! The reference splits the file for reasons that are entirely its own (the installer and the
//! patcher write the realmlist without touching a player's `Config.wtf`), and benilla has neither.
//! Decision 0954's law is one folder and one config file; a second file would buy nothing and
//! would fork the atomic-write, unknown-key-preservation and debounce machinery that already
//! exists. `GetCVar("realmList")` answers, which is also what the reference's own console does.
//!
//! **`$WOW_HOST` still wins for the session** and never reaches the file — the same law
//! `WOW_UI_SCALE`/`WOW_FARCLIP` run under (`crate::cvars`' module doc). Every probe, smoke run and
//! harness leg sets it, so the env path is the one that must not change behaviour: its value is
//! taken **verbatim**, not through [`normalize`], so nothing that connects today can start
//! failing a syntax check.
