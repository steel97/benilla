//! The GM trouble-ticket flow — the Help window's wire, its events, and its answers
//! (decision 1673).
//!
//! **The law worth stating first: the client holds no ticket state.** There is no local "I have a
//! ticket" bit that survives anything; every question is a round trip, and `SMSG_GMTICKET_GETTICKET`
//! is the only truth about whether a ticket exists, what it says, and how long the wait is. That is
//! why this module is almost entirely feed-and-drain with a single counter of substance, and why
//! the Help window re-polls rather than caching.
//!
//! ## Three events, and why each fires when it does
//!
//! - **`UPDATE_TICKET`** — fired for **every** `SMSG_GMTICKET_GETTICKET`, including the "you have
//!   no ticket" answer, and including the second identical answer in a row. It is an **answer
//!   ticket**, not a state diff ([`GmTicketState::answers`]): the shipped window polls
//!   `GetGMTicket()` every `GMTICKET_CHECK_INTERVAL` (600 s) from `TicketStatus_OnUpdate`, and a
//!   feed that suppressed an unchanged answer would make the poll look like a hang. The idiom is
//!   [`crate::ui_party`]'s saved-instance ticket, for exactly the same reason.
//! - **`UPDATE_GM_STATUS`** — fired for every `SMSG_GMTICKETSYSTEMSTATUS`. Sets the window's
//!   `PETITION_QUEUE_ACTIVE`, which gates the whole "page a GM" path.
//! - **`GMSURVEY_DISPLAY`** — **not fired, deliberately.** See "The survey" below.
//!
//! ## The argument order is NOT the wire order
//!
//! `HelpFrameOpenTicket_OnEvent` reads `UPDATE_TICKET` as `arg1` = category, `arg2` = description,
//! `arg3..5` = the three day-valued floats, `arg6` = assignedToGM, `arg7` = openedByGM. The packet
//! puts the **text first and the category second** (both emulators agree byte-for-byte; see
//! [`benilla_protocol::messages::gm_ticket`]). So the reorder happens here, in [`feed_gm_ticket`],
//! which is where the reference client's own handler does it. Do not "fix" the decoder to match
//! the event: that would desynchronise every field after the string.
//!
//! **The no-ticket answer is a single `arg1 = 0`**, because the window's test is
//! `if ( arg1 and arg1 ~= 0 )`. That branch is what resets Submit/Cancel back to SUBMIT/CANCEL and
//! empties the edit box, so it is load-bearing rather than a null case.
//!
//! ## What vmangos actually does, and what that costs us
//!
//! Verified against `/Users/sam/wre/vmangos-src` (`Handlers/GMTicketHandler.cpp`, `GMTicketMgr.cpp`,
//! `Commands/TicketCommands.cpp`) — four behaviours a client author has to design around:
//!
//! 1. **Silence is a legal answer.** Create returns with no packet at all when the queue is off,
//!    when the player is under `GMTickets.MinLevel`, or when the category is ≥ 11
//!    (`GMTicketHandler.cpp:91,106-113`); delete with no ticket likewise (`:73-86`). Nothing here
//!    may block on or retry an answer — and nothing does: every send is fire-and-forget, and the
//!    window's own re-poll is what eventually reconciles.
//! 2. **`SMSG_GMTICKET_GETTICKET` and `SMSG_GMTICKET_DELETETICKET` arrive UNSOLICITED** when a GM
//!    runs `.ticket viewid`/`escalate`/`complete`/`delete` (`GMTicketMgr.cpp:153-159`,
//!    `TicketCommands.cpp:100-103,265,443-452`). They are handled identically to a solicited one,
//!    which is the whole benefit of not correlating answers to asks.
//! 3. **The GM's reply arrives inside the ticket text.** 1.12 has no response channel, so vmangos
//!    appends `"…GM answer: <response>"` to the description itself (`GMTicketMgr.cpp:124-136`).
//!    The window renders it verbatim, which is correct — there is nowhere else for it to go.
//! 4. **Editing is rate-limited to 2 per world tick, and the sanction is a KICK**
//!    (`WorldSession.cpp:1316-1342`). One send per click, never a retry.
//!
//! ## The survey
//!
//! `Blizzard_GMSurveyUI` and the `GMSURVEY_DISPLAY` event are **deferred, not forgotten**. The
//! trigger does not exist on this server: `SMSG_GM_TICKET_STATUS_UPDATE` — the packet cmangos uses
//! to raise a survey — is registered in vmangos's opcode table but **never constructed anywhere in
//! its source**, so a vmangos client can never be asked to fill one in. Building the survey window
//! now would be shipping a panel nothing can open. The DBCs it would read are already on disk and
//! already understood (`GMSurveyCurrentSurvey` → `GMSurveySurveys` → `GMSurveyQuestions`, five
//! questions, ids 28-32), so the work is scoped whenever a server grows the trigger.
