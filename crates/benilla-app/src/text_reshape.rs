//! **The re-shape a `bevy_ui` text root loses when its LAST span is despawned** — an upstream
//! change-detection hole, netted here because falling into it is a hard crash whose panic names
//! none of our code (decision 2212; bug B383, Goudy: *"if you enter world in window mode and then
//! maximize window on linux, the client will crash"*).
//!
//! ## The hole
//!
//! A `bevy_ui` text block is a `Text` root plus its `TextSpan` children. Two pieces of state hang
//! off the root and must agree:
//!
//! - `ComputedTextBlock::buffer` — the shaped cosmic-text buffer, whose every laid-out glyph
//!   carries the **index of the run it came from** in its `metadata`;
//! - `ComputedTextBlock::entities` — the span list that index is an index *into*, rebuilt only by
//!   `TextPipeline::update_buffer`.
//!
//! `bevy_text::detect_text_needs_rerender` is what asks for a re-shape, and on the root it watches
//! `Changed<Text>`, `Changed<TextFont>`, `Changed<TextLayout>`, `Changed<LineHeight>` and
//! `Changed<Children>`. **Despawning the last child does not *change* `Children` — it REMOVES
//! it** (`bevy_ecs`'s relationship `on_replace` hook queues a `remove::<Children>()` once the
//! collection empties), and `Changed<T>` cannot fire for a component the entity no longer has. So
//! a root emptied of spans keeps `needs_rerender == false`, keeps its multi-run buffer, and keeps
//! an `entities` list naming dead entities.
//!
//! Nothing goes wrong until the node is re-laid-out **without** being re-shaped, which is exactly
//! what `widget::text_system` does on any frame where the node's `ComputedNode` changed — a window
//! resize, in other words. `TextPipeline::update_text_layout_info` rebuilds its per-span
//! `glyph_info` by `iter_many`-ing the stored `entities`, and `iter_many` *skips* the dead ones, so
//! the list comes back short while the buffer's glyphs still carry `metadata == 1`. The next line
//! is `self.glyph_info[span_index]` (`bevy_text-0.18.1/src/pipeline.rs:398`) and the client is
//! gone. Nothing about this is platform-specific: Linux is simply where somebody maximized a
//! window after the loading screen had put its tip away.
//!
//! ## The net
//!
//! [`reshape_emptied_text_roots`] restores the invariant the upstream detector cannot see: a
//! `Text` root that just lost its `Children` component is marked changed, one system before the
//! detector runs, so the block is re-shaped in the same frame and can never be re-laid-out stale.
//!
//! It is a **net, not the mechanism** — the site that emptied a node is still expected to leave it
//! coherent (`game_tip::empty_tip` is the one that did not, and it does now). The net exists
//! because the failure mode is a crash rather than a wrong pixel, and because the panic points at
//! third-party code: B383 cost a pastebin core dump and a session to attribute.
//!
//! **Scope: `bevy_ui` text only.** `bevy_sprite`'s `Text2d` has the identical hole and no entry
//! here, because this tree spawns none — and the in-game interface's own `FontString`s do not go
//! through `bevy_ui` at all (they shape through `cosmic-text` under the UI pass, 0068 §2). What is
//! left on `bevy_ui::Text` is the glue screens, the debug panel, and the loading screen's tip.
