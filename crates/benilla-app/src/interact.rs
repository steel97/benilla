//! World interaction foundation — *what is the player pointing at?*
//!
//! This is the shared base for every "point at the world" feature: the debug **object inspector**
//! (today), and tomorrow hover tooltips, the contextual cursor (gear over objects, sword over
//! attackable units), mouseover-targeting, and right-click-to-interact. Built once so we don't build
//! picking + identity twice.
//!
//! Three pieces:
//! - [`WorldObject`] — an **identity** component on every pickable world entity (a doodad/WMO model, a
//!   creature, a GameObject): its kind, a human label (model path or unit name), an id, and an optional
//!   detail line. Attached at the spawn sites.
//! - [`MouseoverTarget`] — the resource [`update_mouseover`] fills each frame with the nearest
//!   `WorldObject` under the cursor, found by ray-casting against the **actual mesh geometry** (so it
//!   works on colliderless props — most doodads, including the campfire — which a physics raycast
//!   misses).
//! - the **inspector surface** ([`inspect_ui`]) — a standalone, key-toggleable overlay (**the dev
//!   chord + `I`**): a weak "armed" pill plus a small identity card that follows the cursor over any
//!   picked object. It's its own surface, *not* a section of the backtick debug panel, so
//!   identifying a thing costs one chord and no panel.
//! - the **cast journal** ([`journal`]) — the *temporal* half of the same instrument: a spell is an
//!   event, gone before a cursor could reach it, so every cast edge is recorded as it flows past and
//!   the same inspector overlay lists the recent ones, click-to-copy.
//!
//! Picking only runs while [`InspectMode`] is on (today's sole consumer, driven by the inspector
//! chord); when real player-facing consumers arrive it simply runs whenever any of them is active.
