//! The faithful **view distance** (`farclip`) — one source of truth for everything that keys off how
//! far the detailed world is drawn. Promoted out of the debug panel (it was a `ModelDebug` field doing
//! double duty) so it's *config*, not a debug knob, and so subsystems read one value instead of
//! several uncoordinated ones.
//!
//! Read by: the hard far-clip **wall** (terrain/model/liquid/WDL/particle shaders, pushed as
//! `fog_params.w` by `lighting::apply_wow_lighting`), the per-object **cull**
//! (`debug_panel::apply_model_visibility`), the particle **draw-set gate**
//! (`particles::sim::simulate_particles`) — both through [`within_farclip`] — and
//! — once `terrain_stream` is split — the tile
//! **stream radius** (which should derive its coverage from `farclip`). Live-editable via the debug
//! panel slider (the same A/B lever as before, now writing this resource).
