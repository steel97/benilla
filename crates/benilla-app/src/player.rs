//! Avatar + camera + input. Free-flies until the server reports our position, then takes third-person
//! control of the avatar (WASD walks it, height-following the terrain) and streams our movement to the
//! server as the confirmed mover. Owns the camera entity. The cursor itself is owned by the
//! [`crate::cursor`] subsystem; this module only hides it during mouselook (`CursorOptions.visible`).
//!
//! Mouse control mirrors vanilla's two look modes (grounded in the WoW 1.12 camera CVars / mouselook
//! API): **right-drag turns the character** (movement then
//! follows the camera heading), **left-drag orbits the camera** around a stationary character; either
//! locks + hides the cursor and restores it on release. **Both buttons held together run the character
//! forward** (vanilla's "both-button move"), steering with the mouse like a right-drag. The **scroll
//! wheel** zooms the third-person
//! distance (clamped to the vanilla `cameraDistanceMax` range; the camera *glides* to the new
//! distance). A left-drag orbit offset is reeled back in by the **auto-follow** — vanilla's
//! `cameraSmoothStyle`, a real player setting since decision 1493 ([`camera::FollowStyle`]):
//! Smart (the shipped default) chases while the character moves, Always chases always, Never
//! leaves the camera exactly where the hand put it.
//! The **dev chord + `F`** toggles free-fly (1043); the **dev chord + `G`** lands the avatar where
//! the camera is ([`land`]).
//!
//! Movement is a thin kinematic capsule controller over avian's `MoveAndSlide` (decision 0009).
