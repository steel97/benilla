//! Setting your hearthstone — the innkeeper's bind question, its dialog, and its answer
//! (decision 1331).
//!
//! **The law this module exists for: selecting the innkeeper's gossip line binds nothing.** It
//! makes the server close the gossip menu and ask (`SMSG_BINDER_CONFIRM`, vmangos
//! `Player::SetBindPoint`); the bind happens only when the client answers `CMSG_BINDER_ACTIVATE`,
//! at which point the innkeeper casts spell 3286 "Bind" and `SPELL_EFFECT_BIND` sends
//! `SMSG_BINDPOINTUPDATE` + `SMSG_PLAYERBOUND`. Before this module the question was parsed as an
//! unknown opcode and dropped, so the click looked like it did nothing at all — half of B249.
//!
//! The Era surface it drives is the reference's own, and it is small (`StaticPopup.lua:1308-1322`,
//! `UIParent.lua:125`/`547-548`):
//!
//! - the `CONFIRM_BINDER` event, whose **one argument** is the name that fills
//!   `"Do you want to make %s your new home?"`;
//! - `ConfirmBinder()` — the dialog's Accept, the only call that sends the activate;
//! - `CheckBinderDist()` — polled from the dialog's `OnUpdate`, and the dialog hides itself the
//!   frame it goes false.
//!
//! Both halves are now **byte-pinned** against the reference's own handler `0x5dfdc0` and its
//! `SMSG_BINDER_CONFIRM` arm `0x5e4aa2` (wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/gossip-icon-and-binder-flow.md`; folded back by decision 1335, which
//! promotes what decision 1331 had to leave INFERRED):
//!
//! 1. **`arg1` is an AREA name, never the NPC's** — the handler never looks a name up. It resolves
//!    the player's own **sub-area** through `AreaTable.dbc`, falls back to the **parent zone** when
//!    that row is missing, and falls back again to the localized `HOME_INN` GlobalString. It always
//!    fires; there is no path on which the question is withheld for want of a name. [`area_name`]
//!    is that chain.
//! 2. **`CheckBinderDist()` is the same gate the rest of the NPC surface uses** — not a
//!    resemblance: the reference's range test is `d² <= [0xc4c28c]`, and `[0xc4c28c]` is
//!    `5.55555534362793²`, the identical constant behind [`crate::target::SERVICE_RANGE_SQ`]
//!    (boundary-inclusive at both sites). So modelling the question as an [`NpcSession`] and
//!    letting [`crate::ui_session::close_npc_session_out_of_range`] close it is faithful, not a
//!    convenience. It is also why nothing here needs a disconnect teardown: an unstreamed guid
//!    reads as gone and closes the question on the next frame.
//!
//! One deviation remains, and it is deliberate: **the reference never clears its latched guid**
//! (`0xc4d7c0`), so a second `ConfirmBinder()` while still in range re-sends the activate. We drop
//! the guid when `SMSG_PLAYERBOUND` says the bind took, because a question that has been answered
//! is not a question — the reference's own dialog is gone by then either way.
