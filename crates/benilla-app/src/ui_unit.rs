//! The app-side **unit snapshot + event feed** (decision 0068 §3): the bridge that turns live ECS
//! game state into the plain data the engine-free `Unit*` Lua bindings read, and into the WoW events
//! that drive a frame's `OnEvent`.
//!
//! The architecture is deliberate (decisions 0006/0061): the Lua game-state API must **not** reach
//! into the ECS. Instead this runs each frame, *before* the VM's tick/event dispatch
//! ([`crate::ui_script::UiInput`]), and pushes a [`UnitState`] snapshot for each unit token into the
//! VM via [`UiScript::set_unit`]. The `"player"` token reads our own avatar's [`ObjectStore`] (tagged
//! [`SelfPlayer`]); `"target"` reads the [`Selection`]'s entity. Both are found by their ECS entity,
//! not by re-deriving a guid — the ECS already owns the guid↔entity map. `"targettarget"` is the one
//! token here that IS reached by a guid: the target's own `UNIT_FIELD_TARGET`, looked up in the same
//! index (decision 1576).
//!
//! Names come from the [`crate::names::NameCache`] (the 1.12 wire has no descriptor names — the
//! query-cache seam): the feed resolves each token's guid, which asks the server once on a miss and
//! fills in a later frame; the transition fires `UNIT_NAME_UPDATE` so frames repaint.
//!
//! The event surface is fired per field on transitions: `UNIT_HEALTH`/`UNIT_MAXHEALTH`/
//! `UNIT_LEVEL` (arg1 = token), the **1.12** per-resource power pair `UNIT_MANA`/`UNIT_RAGE`/
//! `UNIT_FOCUS`/`UNIT_ENERGY`/`UNIT_HAPPINESS` and their five `UNIT_MAX*` twins (arg1 = token; the
//! resource is in the NAME, not an argument — decision 1819, which retired the Era
//! `UNIT_POWER_UPDATE`/`UNIT_MAXPOWER` pair that no 1.12 frame listens for),
//! `UNIT_DISPLAYPOWER` (power *type* changed), `UNIT_NAME_UPDATE`, plus
//! `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` once and `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` on selection change. A token appearing
//! counts as a transition of every present field (frames also pull on target change, so either path
//! populates).

///
/// **The tail's occasions are already ours**, and were years before this system existed:
/// [`crate::ui_script::shutdown_ui_state`] fires `PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD` then `PLAYER_LOGOUT` as
/// the head of the same `0x490bd0` tail, from `end_ui_session` (logout, disconnect, and

/// file said so, and a reader of this doc alone would take the tail's fire for a bug.
///
/// **Cross-map only *for this occasion*, and that falls out of the gate rather than being a rule
/// on top of it.** The first gate (`0x5dd728`) admits only the local player's destructor, and a
/// same-map teleport never destroys the object — including the >30 yd variant that forces a
/// blocking terrain reload, which reloads tiles rather than `CGObject`s. So
/// [`crate::net::WorldportMessage`] is the right edge and `needs_ack` is the right discriminator:
/// the one worldport that does NOT need an ack is the initial-login map, where nothing is being
/// left.
///
/// **Nothing shipped listens to it.** Zero of the 232 extracted reference interface files
/// register `PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD` (controls, same sweep: `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` 22 files,
/// `VARIABLES_LOADED` 7, `PLAYER_LOGIN` 1). This is an addon-facing event, which is exactly why
/// it went missing here for so long — no stock window breaks without it, and only the corpus
/// notices. It is also why this stays a bare fire and promises nothing more: in the reference the
/// handler runs *during* teardown, after the three manager unlinks and ~35 of `0x490a80`'s 37
/// teardown calls, so a real addon's handler already sees a substantially dismantled UI.
///
/// **What "dismantled" costs there is the opposite of what 2235 guessed** (2238; wow-re
/// `20210d32`). The GUID hash's link is `obj+0x1c` and the destructor splices the object out
/// (`0x467887 call 0x468680`) *before* `call [vtbl+0]`, so on THIS occasion — and only this one —
/// a hash lookup misses. But `UnitName("player")` never asks the hash: `0x517020` short-circuits
/// at `0x51707d` and answers from the cached character record `[0xc27d88]`, which has one writer
/// (`CGlueMgr::EnterWorld`) and no clearer; `UnitRace`, `UnitClass` and `0x517ee0` take the same

    //    *any* `PLAYER_FLAGS` bit moving announces itself — not just the ones this struct decodes.
    //    That is why the trigger is the raw dword (`UnitState::player_flags`) and not a bool.
    // 2. **Above the local-GUID gate** at `0x5eea93` (the ghost/resting/PvP/play-time arms below it
    //    are self-only; this one is not) — and the trampoline `0x5e2850` resolves the changed
    //    object by GUID under TYPEMASK_PLAYER, "any player, not the local one" (wow-re
    //    `object-layer/ledger.tsv`). So a *stranger's* flags fire it, which is the whole reason the
    //    stock target frame can listen.
    // 3. **Once per unit token naming that GUID, `arg1` = the token, no `arg2`** — `0x515e50` walks
    //    `0x515c50`'s token array and calls `0x703f50(id, "%s", token)` per entry (wow-re
    //    `ui/scratch/unit-field-event-bridge.md` §2.2). That is exactly this function's own shape,
    //    which is why the arm belongs here and not beside the self-only feeds below.
    //
    // **"Fires for any player" is not "reaches Lua", and the difference is free here.**
    // `0x515e63 test eax,eax / 0x515e6a jle 0x515e8a` skips the fan-out loop entirely on a zero
    // token count, so a remote player who is nobody's target, mouseover, party or raid member
    // announces **nothing** to the VM — the handler still runs, and its helm/cloak arms above the
    // gate still repaint them, but no event is signalled. This feed gets that for nothing by
    // construction: it is only ever called *per token*, so a tokenless player is never reached
    // (wow-re `object-layer/scratch/player-flags-delta-arms.md`, the 2078 correction round).
    //
    // Off the field edge for the same reason `UNIT_FLAGS` is: this is a mirror-diff watcher,
    // and a unit's first snapshot is its CREATE, which runs no notify pass (1098 §4).
    //
    // **The sole 1.12 consumer is the target frame's PARTY-LEADER icon, not an AFK/DND badge** —
    // `TargetFrame.lua:88-95` re-runs the `UnitIsPartyLeader("target")` show/hide, and bit `0x1` is
    // that predicate's descriptor leg. Nothing in 1.12 FrameXML draws an AFK or DND badge on a unit
    // frame, and build 5875 has no `UnitIsAFK`/`UnitIsDND` binding at all (wow-re
    // `ui/scratch/unit-predicate-return-shape.md` §5, a zero-hit whole-image byte census); the
    // `<AFK>`/`<DND>` the era shows are the chat line's `arg6` flag. This comment is here because
