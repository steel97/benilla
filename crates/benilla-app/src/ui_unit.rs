//! The app-side **unit snapshot + event feed** (decision 0068 §3): the bridge that turns live ECS
//! game state into the plain data the engine-free `Unit*` Lua bindings read, and into the WoW events
//! that drive a frame's `OnEvent`.
//!
//! The architecture is deliberate (decisions 0006/0061): the Lua game-state API must **not** reach
//! into the ECS. Instead this runs each frame, *before* the VM's tick/event dispatch
//! ([`crate::ui_script::UiInput`]), and pushes a [`UnitState`] snapshot for each unit token into the
//! VM via [`UiScript::set_unit`]. The `"player"` token reads our own avatar's [`ObjectStore`] (tagged
//! [`SelfPlayer`]); `"target"` reads the [`Selection`]'s entity. Both are found by their ECS entity,
//! not by re-deriving a guid — the ECS already owns the guid↔entity map.
//!
//! Names come from the [`crate::names::NameCache`] (the 1.12 wire has no descriptor names — the
//! query-cache seam): the feed resolves each token's guid, which asks the server once on a miss and
//! fills in a later frame; the transition fires `UNIT_NAME_UPDATE` so frames repaint.
//!
//! The event surface is the Era set, fired per field on transitions: `UNIT_HEALTH`/`UNIT_MAXHEALTH`/
//! `UNIT_LEVEL` (arg1 = token), `UNIT_POWER_UPDATE`/`UNIT_MAXPOWER` (token, power token e.g.
//! `"MANA"`), `UNIT_DISPLAYPOWER` (power *type* changed), `UNIT_NAME_UPDATE`, plus
//! `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` once and `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` on selection change. A token appearing
//! counts as a transition of every present field (frames also pull on target change, so either path
//! populates).
