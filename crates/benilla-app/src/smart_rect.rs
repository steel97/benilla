//! **SmartScreenRect** — the client's shared draw-time anti-overlap placement solver
//! (`UIUtil\SmartScreenRect`, wow-re `ui/scratch/smartscreenrect-solver-law.md`, §5-verified
//! 2026-07-13, a7825131). Every frame each participant submits its desired screen rect; the
//! solver relocates it off the rects already claimed **this frame in its own bucket** and then
//! claims the result, so later rects dodge earlier ones. Exactly two buckets exist in 5875 and
//! they never interact: **nameplates (bucket 0)** and **combat worldtext (bucket 1)** — a plate
//! never pushes a number. This is the mechanism behind the reference's whole non-overlap feel:
//! plates bounce off each other, a late number shoves the earlier one upward, crits (whose
//! measured half-extents balloon with the scale pop) both push and get pushed harder, and a
//! pushed rect **snaps back** the frame its blocker expires because the desire is re-derived
//! from the anchor every frame — the solver keeps no cross-frame state at all.
//!
//! The law, transcribed to our Y-DOWN logical-pixel viewport (the ref computes in the Y-UP gx
//! device space `[0,G44]×[0,G48]`; every clamp below is bound-symmetric, so the mirror is exact):
//! - **Solve** (`0x5097a0`): bounded FIFO/BFS. Seed = the input rect band-clamped on-screen
//!   (`0x509bf0` mode 0); its region (3×3, `0x509d80`) picks a 4-try push-direction order
//!   ([`ORDER`], `.rdata 0x8087e0`) fixed for the whole solve. Each dequeued node tries the 4
//!   directions in region order: a push against the **first** strictly-overlapping claimed rect
//!   (`0x509220`, zero padding — touching edges do not overlap) lands the node **edge-to-edge**
//!   with the blocker (`0x5091c0/0x509300/0x509360/0x5093c0`); an *unmoved* try means the spot
//!   is free — **adopt immediately**; a moved rect is enqueued for re-checking against the whole
//!   bucket. Dequeues are capped at `(⌊W/w⌋+1)·(⌊H/h⌋+1)` (`0x509dd0`); exhaustion returns the
//!   input unmodified — an unplaceable rect draws overlapping at its anchor, never hides.
//! - **Seat tail** (shared by both seats `0x509520`/`0x509ec0`): clamp the solved rect's center-X
//!   to `[halfW, W−halfW]` and its physical-TOP edge to `[halfH, H−halfH]`, rebuild top-anchored,
//!   re-normalize on-screen (`0x509e20`), then **claim** (`0x509660`).
//! - The node-strategy skip at `0x509874` is dead in 5875 (`+0x18` is never written past the
//!   ctor's `-1`) and the `showsmartrects` CVar has no readers — the solver is unconditionally
//!   live and every node tries all four directions. Both are replicated by simply not porting
//!   them.
