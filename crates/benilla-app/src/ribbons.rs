//! Faithful M2 **ribbon trails** — weapon enchant trails, wisp streamers, spell-missile trails.
//!
//! The 1.12 client simulates a ribbon as a ring of **edges**: each frame the emitter's bone-local
//! origin is transformed by the live bone matrix into a node point, `floor(dt·edgesPerSecond +
//! phase)` new edges (a vertex pair at `±heightAbove/heightBelow` across the node) are committed
//! and backdated inside the frame, old edges age out at `edgeLifetime`, **gravity carries the
//! stored verts along world +Z by `g·t²`** — up for the positive majority of the corpus — and the
//! edge list renders as a triangle strip whose `u` texcoord slides with edge age (the texture's
//! transparent tail fades the trail). Byte-exact spec: wow-5875-re
//! `system/models/scratch/ribbon-emitter-spec.md`; the sim below transcribes it with the same
//! simplifications as `particles` (distributions and frames mirrored, not the reference's exact
//! float slots).
//!
//! Like particles, each trail writes its strip into the **shared effect-quad stream**
//! ([`crate::particles::buffer::EffectQuads`], decision 0732 slice P1) — per segment, one quad
//! duplicating the shared edge vertices (identical triangles to the old strip mesh; a few dozen
//! extra vertices per trail buys the whole family one vertex layout and one index pattern). A
//! trail rides its **owner** entity (a skinned model's host-bone joint, an item root, a
//! missile); when the owner goes it drains — committed edges finish fading, then the trail
//! despawns itself (the reference's enable-gate law).
