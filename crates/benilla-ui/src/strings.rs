//! **One faithful substitution for reference string templates** — the client's `SStrPrintf` face.
//!
//! Every user-visible sentence benilla shows comes from `GlobalStrings.lua` or `GlueStrings.lua`
//! (decision 2045), and most of those carry `%s`/`%d` holes the caller fills. Doing that filling
//! correctly is not `format!`'s job and never was: the template is *data read at runtime from the
//! player's install*, so the holes have to be walked, not compiled.
//!
//! **Why this module exists.** Before it, the substitution had been reinvented at least eight
//! times across the workspace, with semantics that did not agree:
//!
//! - `ui_instance::fill_template` — ordered, `%%`-aware, starvation-safe, and tested. The best of
//!   them, and the one this is derived from.
//! - `ui_duel::winner_line` — a hand-rolled `%1$s`/`%2$s` positional pass, because the duel's
//!   retreat wording swaps its two names and no ordered filler can express that.
//! - `ui_action::errors::ui_error_text` — `str::replace`, which fills **every** `%s` with the
//!   *same* argument. Latent rather than live (no message it currently carries has two), but it
//!   was a real trap waiting for the first two-argument template to reach that queue.
//! - `ui_guild::fill`, `ui_petition::fill`, and one-off `replacen` calls in `ui_binder`,
//!   `ui_trade`, `ui_items::feed` and `equip_error`.
//!
//! Eight copies of one primitive is how the `ui_error_text` bug survived: there was no single
//! place where "how do we fill a reference template" could be got right once.
//!
//! **The semantics, and why each is what it is.**
//!
//! - `%s` and `%d` consume the next argument, **left to right**. This is `SStrPrintf`'s own order.
//! - `%N$s` / `%N$d` take argument `N` (1-based) and do **not** move the sequential cursor. 1.12
//!   uses these exactly where a translation needs to reorder the holes —
//!   `DUEL_WINNER_RETREAT = "%2$s has fled from %1$s in a duel"` is the canonical case, and it is
//!   also why hardcoding an English sentence is a localization bug and not merely untidy.
//! - `%%` collapses to one `%`.
//! - **A specifier whose argument is missing is copied through literally.** A template we
//!   mis-modelled should look wrong, not look plausible — `ui_instance` established this and it is
//!   the right call: a visibly broken line gets reported, a quietly wrong one does not.
//! - Any other specifier is copied through untouched.
//!
//! **`%c` and `%f`/`%g` are here because 1.12's own tables use them**, not for completeness. The
//! item tooltip's stat and resistance families are spelled with a *character* hole for the sign —
//! `ITEM_MOD_AGILITY = "%c%d Agility"`, `ITEM_RESIST_SINGLE = "%c%d %s Resistance"` — and its
//! rate lines with a float one: `DPS_TEMPLATE = "(%.1f damage per second)"`,
//! `AMMO_DAMAGE_TEMPLATE = "Adds %g damage per second"`. A filler that only knew `%s`/`%d` would
//! copy those holes through visibly, which is the same as not being able to show the line.
//!
//! **The precision is the template's, never the caller's** — `%.1f` is one decimal because
//! `DPS_TEMPLATE` says so, and a locale that respells it to `%.2f` gets two without a code change.
//! That is the whole point of reading the template at runtime.
