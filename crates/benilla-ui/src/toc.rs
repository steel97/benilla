//! The `.toc` manifest parser — the load list + metadata of every addon, including Blizzard's own
//! (`FrameXML.toc` and the `Blizzard_*` AddOns are ordinary manifests; third-party addons are the
//! identical mechanism — decision 0068).
//!
//! Grammar, shared by 1.12 and Era manifests (Era only adds directive *keys*, not syntax):
//! - `## Key: Value` — a directive. Keys compare case-insensitively; localized variants carry a
//!   locale suffix (`## Title-deDE: …`). Era manifests list several client builds in one
//!   `## Interface: 11507, 11508`.
//! - `#` (not followed by another `#`) — a comment.
//! - anything else non-blank — a file to load, in order (`.lua`/`.xml`, `\` or `/` separators).
//!
//! The parser is lossless about order (directives keep file order for duplicate keys; files keep
//! load order) and byte-tolerant: UTF-8 BOM, `\r\n`, and stray whitespace are the norm in shipped
//! manifests, not the exception.
