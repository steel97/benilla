//! The **PvP + honor** surface — `TogglePVP` (decision 0646) and the vanilla honor system's
//! thirteen bindings (decision 1512): the character window's Honor tab, the inspect window's Honor
//! tab, and the rank every unit frame can read off a *foreign* player.
//!
//! ## The three seams
//!
//! The crate's usual split (decision 0068 §3 — no ECS, no wire, no DBC in here):
//!
//! - **Pushed state.** The local player's honor counters are PRIVATE descriptor fields
//!   (`PLAYER_FIELD_SESSION_KILLS` … `PLAYER_FIELD_BYTES2`), so the app decodes them and pushes a
//!   [`HonorState`] ([`UiScript::set_honor`]); the six self getters read it and nothing else.
//!   The inspect pane's numbers are **not** a descriptor: `MSG_INSPECT_HONOR_STATS` (`0x2D6`) is a
//!   request/reply pair, so they arrive separately as an [`InspectHonorData`]
//!   ([`UiScript::set_inspect_honor`]) — and *whether one is held* is exactly what
//!   `HasInspectHonorData` reports, which is the latch the reference's `OnShow` gates its request
//!   on. That is why the inspect half is an `Option`, and the self half too — but the `Option` is
//!   the **latch only**: the engine's data slots are zero-initialised BSS that every getter reads
//!   ungated, so "nothing held" answers **zeros at full width**, never nils and never a short
//!   return. The one thing an empty slot changes is `HasInspectHonorData`.
//! - **Intents.** `TogglePVP` queues a `CMSG_TOGGLE_PVP` ([`UiScript::take_pvp_toggles`]) and
//!   `RequestInspectHonorData` queues the honor query
//!   ([`UiScript::take_inspect_honor_requests`]) — both counts rather than payloads, because
//!   neither packet carries anything the VM knows: the toggle has an empty body, and the honor
//!   query's body is the *inspected player's* guid, which the app already holds
//!   ([`super::inspect`]'s target). Same reasoning as `NotifyInspect`, one argument smaller.
//!   The honor query carries a second piece of engine state with it — the **`pending` latch**
//!   (`0xb71fcc`), which refuses a second query while one is in flight; see the binding.
//! - **The unit snapshot.** A *foreign* player's rank is knowable at all because `PLAYER_BYTES_3`
//!   is a PUBLIC field — byte 3 of it is the CURRENT rank — so it rides
//!   [`UnitState::pvp_rank`](super::UnitState::pvp_rank) with the other public per-unit facts and
//!   `UnitPVPRank("target")` answers for the inspect pane exactly as the reference's does.
//!
//! ## Two ranks, and neither is the other
//!
//! - **Internal rank**, `0..=19`: the byte on the wire, and the number `GetPVPRankInfo` keys its
//!   title lookup on. `0` is "no rank"; `1..=4` are the dishonorable ranks; `5..=18` are
//!   Scout/Private through High Warlord/Grand Marshal; `19` is the racial-leader "Leader", which
//!   the server sends in `SMSG_PVP_CREDIT` and **`GetPVPRankInfo` refuses** (see below).
//! - **Visual rank**, `-4..=14`: `rank >= 5 ? rank - 4 : rank - 5` (`0x51aa31`) — what
//!   `GetPVPRankInfo` *returns* as its second value, and what FrameXML indexes the badge texture by
//!   (`"…PvPRank"..format("%02d", rankNumber)`, drawn only when it is positive).
//!
//! **The negative half runs the other way from the server's.** vmangos's `HonorMgr.cpp:991`
//! computes `visualRank = rank > 4 ? rank - 4 : rank * -1`, which gives rank 1 → −1 and rank 4 →
//! −4; the *binding* subtracts 5 instead of negating, so it gives rank 1 → **−4** and rank 4 →
//! **−1**. They genuinely disagree, and the client is the authority for what the client's binding
//! returns — [`visual_rank`] implements the binding. Nothing here reads the server's form, and a
//! reader "fixing" this back to `-rank` would be reverting a §5 cross-check.
//!
//! Conflating the two scales puts Sergeant's badge on a Corporal, so [`visual_rank`] is the one
//! place the conversion happens and every caller goes through it. The trap is that both numbers
//! travel: the badge and `GetPVPRankInfo`'s second return are **visual**, while the wire —
//! `PLAYER_BYTES_3` byte 3, `GetInspectHonorData`'s `lifetimeRank`, and `SMSG_PVP_CREDIT`'s
//! `victimRank` (decision 1512 §2's second-pass correction: `HonorMgr::SendPVPCredit` sends
//! `GetRank().rank`) — is **internal** throughout, which is what lets a rank byte index a
//! `PVP_RANK_*` GlobalString with no conversion at all.
//!
//! ## Why the rank titles come out of the VM's own globals
//!
//! A rank's name is the GlobalString `PVP_RANK_<internal>_<team>` — the engine's one format string
//! (`"PVP_RANK_%d_%d"` @ `0x8445b4`), team `0` Horde and `1` Alliance (VERIFIED against the shipped
//! `FactionGroup.dbc` *and* `GlobalStrings.lua`: `PVP_RANK_5_0` is "Scout", `PVP_RANK_5_1` is
//! "Private"). The real `GlobalStrings.lua` is executed off the player's own install at boot, so
//! those keys are already sitting on `_G` when `GetPVPRankInfo` runs, and reading them there is the
//! only correct answer: a table of titles shipped in this repo would be Blizzard text we may not
//! carry (the contract's install-content rule) *and* wrong in every non-enUS locale. There is **no
//! `PVP_RANK_0_*`** — internal rank 0 names nothing, and both reference panes lean on that nil to
//! fall back to the `NONE` GlobalString, so a missing key answers nil here rather than an empty
//! string or a raise.
//!
//! The team digit is a **tri-state**, not a bool: `0x5efe00` answers `0` Horde, `1` Alliance, or
//! **`-1`** for a unit with no side, and −1 is not special-cased anywhere — it is formatted into
//! the key, `PVP_RANK_9_-1` matches no GlobalString, and the miss *is* the "no title" answer.
//!
//! ## `_FEMALE` is real, and the honor pane never sees it
//!
//! The `_FEMALE` twins ship in `GlobalStrings.lua`, and the engine cannot build their keys: the
//! byte sequence `FEMALE` does not occur anywhere in `WoW.exe`. It reaches them by asking
//! **FrameXML** — `0x703bf0(key, ordinal, gender)` takes a Lua path whenever `gender != 0`, calling
//! `GetText(token, gender, ordinal)`, which appends the suffix for gender 3. So the *suffix* is
//! Lua's and the *request* is the engine's, per call site:
//!
//! - **`GetPVPRankInfo` passes gender 0** (`0x51aa0f`) and takes the fast path — so the character
//!   and inspect honor panes render the **male/default title even for a female character**.
//! - **`UnitPVPName`'s title is gendered** by the subject unit (`0x612bf0`), and
//!   **`SMSG_PVP_CREDIT`'s is gendered by the LOCAL PLAYER** even though the *team* digit is the
//!   victim's (`0x625374`) — the app's chat line owns that asymmetry, through
//!   [`UiScript::pvp_rank_title`].
//!
//! So [`rank_title_ungendered`] and [`rank_title_gendered`] are two functions on purpose, and
//! `GetPVPRankInfo` calls the first. **A client that gendered the pane's title would be more
//! "correct" than the reference and would diverge from it**, which is not what we build.
//!
//! ## The counter-intuitive four (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/honor-panel-law.md`, §5, 2026-08-21)
//!
//! Everything below is byte law from that carve, and every one of them looks like a bug:
//!
//! 1. `GetPVPRankProgress` **multiplies by a slightly-wrong f32 reciprocal** and does not clamp —
//!    [`rank_progress`].
//! 2. The four dishonorable ranks' visual numbers run **backwards** from the server's — see "Two
//!    ranks" above.
//! 3. `GetPVPRankInfo` **rejects rank 19**, whose GlobalString exists and which the credit line and
//!    `UnitPVPName` both render.
//! 4. `GetPVPLifetimeStats` **suppresses a highest-lifetime rank below 5**, reporting `0`.

    //    first is that same order.

    //    non-player unit, or no local player leaves the team register at its initial 0 — the HORDE

    // *cleared*: re-keying the cache zeroes the two flags and leaves the data, so the real client
    // can answer a previous target's numbers here while `HasInspectHonorData` says no. We cannot —
    // our data and our latch are one `Option` — and that is the one place this pair diverges: it
    // needs the app to own the flag separately, which is a seam change, not a fix here.)
