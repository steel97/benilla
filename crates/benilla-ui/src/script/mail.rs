//! The mail bindings (decision 0544 P1/P2) — the Era-shaped mailbox surface, the same two-way seam
//! as [`super::merchant`]/[`super::loot`]: the app pushes a **mail snapshot**
//! ([`UiScript::set_mail`] — the inbox rows already resolved from the wire to
//! name/icon/sender/body by the app's item-template + name caches) and the Lua
//! `CheckInbox`/`TakeInboxItem`/`SendMail`/… calls queue outbound **intents** the app drains. The
//! engine holds no mail knowledge — a row is a header (sender/subject/money/COD/expiry/flags), an
//! optional enclosed item (id/name/icon/quality), an ask-once letter body, and a stationery
//! basename.
//!
//! ## The 5875 API shape (VERIFIED against the extracted `MailFrame.lua`)
//!
//! `index` is **1-based** everywhere; an out-of-range index answers `nil`/`0`. The inbox getters:
//! `GetInboxNumItems()`, `GetInboxHeaderInfo(index)` → the reference 13-tuple
//! `packageIcon, stationeryIcon, sender, subject, money, CODAmount, daysLeft, hasItem(count|nil),
//! wasRead, wasReturned, textCreated, canReply, isGM` (MailFrame.lua l.105/265/279),
//! `GetInboxText(index)` → `body, stationeryTexture, isTakeable, isInvoice` (l.292 — a body cache
//! miss queues the `CMSG_ITEM_TEXT_QUERY` fetch and returns `""`), `GetInboxItem(index)` →
//! `name, texture, count, quality, canUse` (l.379), `InboxItemCanDelete(index)` → 1/nil (the
//! delete-vs-return law, l.417/450). `HasNewMail()` reads the app-pushed login-scoped flag
//! ([`UiScript::set_has_new_mail`], decision 0544 P3) — `nil` (false) until the app's first
//! `MSG_QUERY_NEXT_MAIL_TIME` answer lands.
//!
//! The send tab: `GetSendMailItem()` → `name, texture, stackCount, quality` off the attached cursor
//! item (l.511), `GetSendMailPrice()` → the flat **30c** postage (vmangos's fee), `SendMail(target,
//! subject, body)` fires the send, `SetSendMailMoney`/`SetSendMailCOD(copper)` push the money/COD
//! amounts the app reads at send time, `ClickSendMailItemButton()` attaches (or detaches) the
//! cursor's held bag item as the send attachment (l.719). Intents `CheckInbox`, `TakeInboxItem`,
//! `TakeInboxMoney`, `DeleteInboxItem`, `ReturnInboxItem`, `CloseMail` are 1-based row indices /
//! flags the app maps to the wire.
