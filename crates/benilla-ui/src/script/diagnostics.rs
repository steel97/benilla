//! The **script error log** — what went wrong, kept where the player can read it (decision 1495).
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! 1305 gave script errors a *screen*: the engine dispatches every caught error to
//! `geterrorhandler()`, and FrameXML's `_ERRORMESSAGE` puts the red `ScriptErrors` dialog up. That
//! is the reference's behaviour and it stays exactly as it is. It is also, on its own, not enough,
//! and the reporters said so within a day of it shipping — Goudy, *minutes after screenshotting
//! that very dialog working*: *"some kind of lua error frame probably needs to be implemented, as
//! there are a lot of addons that still doesn't work"*; nazriel_0, two days later: *"probably we
//! should start using something like Bug Grabber to report those stack traces better"* (ledger
//! B293, split from B271).
//!
//! Both asks are the same three gaps, and all three are about *memory*:
//!
//! 1. **`_ERRORMESSAGE` shows a burst's FIRST message only** — its own `ScriptErrors:IsVisible()`
//!    guard, faithfully transcribed. A world entry that raises 1,113 times (1305 measured exactly
//!    that) shows one string. This is precisely why BugGrabber exists in the real world.
//! 2. **An addon can fail to load without ever raising**, and those failures had no channel at all
//!    — a manifest entry the package does not ship, a document that will not parse, a dependency
//!    cycle, a missing hard dependency, a broken `Bindings.xml`. They logged to the terminal and
//!    stopped; the addon simply was not there and the client said nothing. That is the literal
//!    content of *"a lot of addons that still doesn't work"*.
//! 3. **Nothing retained anything.** [`super::UiScript::take_errors`] drains to the host log every
//!    frame, so once a frame passed, the terminal held the only copy. A player cannot read a
//!    terminal, and a bug report written from one is what B271 was debugged off.
//!
//! ## What this is, and what it deliberately is not
//!
//! A bounded, deduplicating, ordered log of everything that went wrong this session, written at
//! the two choke points every failure already passes ([`super::model::Model::record_script_error`]
//! and [`super::UiScript::report_load_failure`]) and read by whatever wants to show it.
//!
//! **"Session" means one world session, not one process.** The log lives on the `Model`, and the
//! in-game UI is rebuilt onto a fresh VM at every world entry (1290) — so a logout or a `ReloadUI`
//! starts an empty log. That is the right boundary and it self-heals: the load walk runs again on
//! the way back in and re-records whatever is still broken. What it is *not* is a place to look for
//! what happened before the reload you just did.
//!
//! It is **purely additive**: no dispatch changes, no `_ERRORMESSAGE` change, no divergence from
//! the reference's own behaviour. The reference simply never had this instrument, and *"a modern,
//! idiomatic client"* covers building one.
//!
//! It is **not** a transcription of BugGrabber, which is somebody else's addon (and not Blizzard's
//! either). It is our own equivalent, and an addon that installs its own `seterrorhandler` still
//! wins outright for the dispatch half exactly as 1195/1305 leave it.
//!
//! ## Dedupe, order, and the bound
//!
//! **Repeats collapse onto the first occurrence and bump a count.** An `OnUpdate` that raises
//! every frame is one row reading `×1113`, not 1,113 rows — without that the log is useless within
//! seconds, and unbounded besides.
//!
//! **Order is first-occurrence, oldest first.** The load-time failures are the causes and the
//! later runtime errors are usually their consequences, so a chronological read is the one that
//! explains itself. A repeat does *not* move its row to the end: a row that jumps around while you
//! read it is worse than a stale position.
//!
//! **[`DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_CAP`] distinct rows**, evicting oldest-first. `seq` is monotonic and never
//! reused, so an evicted prefix is visible as a gap rather than silently rewriting history — a
//! surface can say "showing #251-#500" honestly. The cap binds *distinct* messages, which after
//! dedupe is a much higher ceiling than it looks: 1305's 1,113-raise run produces **one** row.
