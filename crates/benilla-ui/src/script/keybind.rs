//! The **key-binding table** — the client's chord→command store, engine side (decision 0997).
//!
//! In the reference every rebindable action is a *binding*: a command name (`MOVEFORWARD`)
//! carrying a category header and up to two bound key chords, stored key→command and saved to
//! `bindings-cache.wtf`. 1.12 exposes the whole system to Lua (`Blizzard_BindingUI` is plain
//! FrameXML over it): `GetNumBindings`/`GetBinding(i)`, `SetBinding(key[, command])` with its
//! steal-the-key law, `GetBindingKey`/`GetBindingAction`, and the three-set model —
//! `LoadBindings(0 default | 1 account | 2 character)`, `SaveBindings(which)`,
//! `GetCurrentBindingSet()`.
//!
//! benilla keeps the same shape at the same seam, split like the CVar table (0954): the **host
//! registers** the commands it actually implements (honest-tree — no row without a real engine
//! action) with their 1.12 default chords, **this table is the string-domain truth** the window's
//! Lua reads and writes synchronously, and the app derives its dispatch view (parsed chords →
//! latched commands) whenever [`super::UiScript::keybinds_generation`] moves, persisting on the
//! queued [`KeybindRequest::Save`]. Chord strings are the reference's own canon —
//! `[ALT-][CTRL-][SHIFT-]<TOKEN>` (`W`, `SPACE`, `NUMPAD0`, `BUTTON4`, `MOUSEWHEELUP`) — matched
//! by string equality exactly as the client does (decision 0585's law, now engine-wide).
//!
//! The stored account/character sets live here too (seeded by the app from
//! `benilla-config/bindings/…`, re-snapshotted on save), so `LoadBindings` is **synchronous** like the
//! reference's — the window calls it and repaints in the same tick, no host round-trip.
//!
//! **Addons register into the same table** (decision 1188 phase 4). An addon's `Bindings.xml`
//! ([`crate::bindings_xml`]) arrives through [`super::UiScript::register_addon_bindings`] and
//! becomes ordinary rows: same names, same chords, same window, same save file. The one thing an
//! addon row carries that a host row does not is a **body** — the Lua chunk the app's dispatch
//! runs on the press (and, for `runOnUp`, again on the release with `keystate = "up"`) — because a
//! host command's action is engine-side and has no Lua to hold. That body is the *only* asymmetry;
//! everything downstream of registration treats the two identically.
