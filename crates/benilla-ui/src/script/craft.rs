//! The craft bindings (decision 0437 phase 3) — the Era-shaped Enchanting-window surface driving a
//! faithful port of the real 1.12 `CraftFrame` (extracted from `interface.MPQ`:
//! `Interface\FrameXML\Blizzard_CraftUI\CraftFrame.{xml,lua}`). The exact twin of [`super::tradeskill`]
//! (same two-way seam, same "no wire" law, same FLAT-list INTERIM): the app pushes a **craft
//! snapshot** ([`UiScript::set_craft`] — the recipes already resolved to name/subname/icon/
//! description/reagents/tools/color by the app from `Spell.dbc`/`SkillLineAbility.dbc`/bag counts),
//! and the Lua `DoCraft`/`CloseCraft` calls queue outbound **intents** the app drains
//! ([`UiScript::take_craft_dos`] returns spell ids / [`UiScript::take_craft_close`]). The engine holds
//! no recipe knowledge — a recipe is name/subname/icon/description/difficulty/reagents/tools, all
//! app-resolved (0437 §"The decision" item 1). `CraftRecipe` reuses [`super::TradeSkillDifficulty`]
//! outright (0437's own framing: "one solved pattern") rather than a second color enum — the Era
//! `CraftTypeColor`/`TradeSkillTypeColor` tables are byte-identical (ref `Blizzard_CraftUI.lua:6-13` vs
//! `Blizzard_TradeSkillUI.lua`'s own table), so the four color keys really are one vocabulary.
//!
//! ## Where Craft actually differs from TradeSkill (verified against the ref, not assumed)
//!
//! - **No Create All.** The 1.12 `CraftFrame` ships one action button (`DoCraft(GetCraftSelectionIndex())`,
//!   ref `Blizzard_CraftUI.xml:667`) — no repeat-count EditBox, no `GetCraftskillRepeatCount`. `DoCraft`
//!   therefore queues a bare spell id, never a `(spell id, count)` pair — [`UiScript::take_craft_dos`]
//!   returns `Vec<u32>`.
//! - **`GetCraftInfo` is a 7-tuple, not TradeSkill's 4-tuple**: `craftName, craftSubSpellName, craftType,
//!   numAvailable, isExpanded, trainingPointCost, requiredLevel` (ref l.37/168/289) — the trailing three
//!   are Beast Training's own fields (a pet ability's training-point cost + the pet's required level).
//!   Beast Training is out of scope (0437's own line — the pet arc owns it), so v1 hardcodes
//!   `trainingPointCost = 0` and `requiredLevel = 0` — never nonzero, so every ref branch gated on them
//!   (`Craft_UpdateTrainingPoints`, the per-row Cost text, the red/green pet-level Requirements line) is
//!   unreachable and dropped from the ported XML, not merely stubbed (this file's job is the tuple
//!   shape; the XML's job is not painting dead branches).
//! - **A recipe carries a `sub_name`** (`craftSubSpellName`) TradeSkill's own recipes never have — the
//!   ref's row paints it in parens beside the name (`format(TEXT(PARENS_TEMPLATE), craftSubSpellName)`,
//!   ref l.218) when non-empty. Enchanting itself rarely uses it (most enchant spells have no sub-rank
//!   text), but the field is real in the ref's own tuple, so it ships in v1 rather than being folded away.
//! - **A recipe carries a pre-resolved `description`** (`GetCraftDescription`, ref l.312) TradeSkill's
//!   own recipe never exposes to Lua at all — Enchanting's detail pane shows the spell's flavor/effect
//!   text above the reagent grid (ref `CraftDescription`), a region TradeSkill's own detail pane has no
//!   analogue for.
//! - **No product-item concept.** TradeSkill's `product_item`/`min_made`/`max_made`/`cooldown_secs`
//!   have no Craft equivalent: an enchant recipe doesn't "create" a bag item the way a tradeskill recipe
//!   does (it modifies an item in place, or resolves as a pure effect) — `CraftIcon`'s hover shows the
//!   **spell**, not a product item (`GameTooltip:SetCraftSpell`, ref l.566, vs TradeSkill's
//!   `SetTradeSkillItem` with no reagent index) — see [`super::tooltip_item`]'s `SetCraftSpell`.
//! - **`needs_item_target` has no Lua getter.** It is pure app-side bookkeeping (0437 §"What scoping
//!   verified": `TARGET_FLAG_ITEM` enchant casts need a client-side item pick after `DoCraft`) — the
//!   ref XML plays no part in that flow (no such concept exists in the real client's item-target UX
//!   either; it's the cursor/target machinery, not FrameXML). See `CraftFrame.xml`'s own header note.
//!
//! ## v1 is FLAT — no header rows (the law landed for TradeSkill; Craft is a named divergence)
//!
//! Exactly [`super::tradeskill`]'s own v1 law: [`CraftState::recipes`] renders as one flat row per
//! recipe, `index` 1-based straight into the list — though the ORDER of that list is now this
//! module's, not the app's (decision 1124: [`recipe_order`], the craft type's own byte-verified
//! comparator, applied in [`UiScript::set_craft`]). `GetCraftInfo` therefore never
//! returns the `"header"` `craftType` the ref Lua also checks for (ref l.38/77/199/252/292). The
//! header/grouping law itself is no longer pending — decision 0446 confirmed it byte-exact (wow-re
//! `tradeskill` TU-B) and TradeSkill grew the real tree engine ([`super::tradeskill`]'s `build_groups`)
//! on it. Craft never got the same port and stays on this v1 flat render; `Expand/CollapseCraftSkillLine`
//! are still literal no-ops, wired only so the ported XML's header-click handlers don't error
//! (TradeSkill's `Expand/CollapseTradeSkillSubClass` precedent). 0446 also confirmed the one live case
//! (Enchanting) renders flat either way — a single group's header suppresses under TradeSkill's own law
//! too — so the divergence is currently unobservable, but it is real and named as a follow-up in
//! decision 0530.
//!
//! ## The tooltip channels
//!
//! `GameTooltip:SetCraftItem(craftIndex, reagentIndex)` is registered in [`super::tooltip_item`],
//! beside `SetTradeSkillItem`. `GameTooltip:SetCraftSpell(craftIndex)` lives in
//! [`super::tooltip_spell`] beside `SetTrainerService`, its structural twin: both are SELECTORS
//! into the shared spell/item builders rather than renderers of their own. The v1 two-line
//! "name white, description gold" render is gone — `SetCraftSpell 0x533e90` funnels into the same
//! `0x52e610`/`0x52b650` pair every other content binding does, so two lines were eight-plus short
//! (wow-re `ui/scratch/trainer-service-tooltip-law.md` §4.1).
