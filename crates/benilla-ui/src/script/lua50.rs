//! **The Lua 5.0 dialect** — the layer that makes an mlua 5.1 VM answer the questions a 1.12 addon
//! asks about its interpreter (decision 1194).
//!
//! The 1.12.1 client embeds **Lua 5.0**; we embed mlua's `lua51`. Every prior decision in this
//! crate treated that as a detail — 0068 called the target "stock Lua 5.1", and the WoW stdlib
//! layer beside this one is written as aliases *onto* 5.1. It is not a detail. It is the single
//! largest measured blocker in the whole addon arc:
//!
//! ```text
//! what stopped them (addons whose FIRST load error was each):
//!    61  error: 'X' is obsolete          <- table.setn, raised by Lua 5.1
//! ```
//!
//! Sixty-one of 218 real vanilla addons, plus ~23 more that merely depend on one of them, stopped
//! on their first chunk. The chain is worth spelling out because it is not obvious and because
//! **we caused the last link ourselves**: `AceLibrary.lua` opens with
//!
//! ```lua
//! local version = GetBuildInfo()
//! if string.find(version, "^2%.") then
//!     table_setn = function() end   -- TBC: Lua 5.1, setn is gone
//! else
//!     table_setn = table.setn       -- 1.12: Lua 5.0, setn is real
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! Ace asks the client which client it is and picks the right dialect. We started answering
//! `"1.12.1"` truthfully (1192 phase 5, `GetBuildInfo`), Ace correctly took the 5.0 branch, and our
//! 5.1 VM raised. The addon was right, the API was right, and the interpreter underneath was
//! lying. That is what this module fixes.
//!
//! ## What it does, in three parts
//!
//! 1. **`table.setn`/`table.getn` get their 5.0 meaning back.** 5.0 remembers a table's size —
//!    in a numeric `t.n` field if one already exists, otherwise in a private weak-keyed table
//!    where nothing walking the table can see it. 5.1 removed the concept and made `setn` raise.
//!    The exact mechanism matters more than it looks: see [`LUA_5_0_TABLE_SIZE`] for the draft
//!    that got it wrong and the 39 addons that noticed.
//! 2. **The 5.1-only members are removed.** `string.gmatch`/`match`/`reverse`, `table.maxn`,
//!    `math.fmod`/`modf`/`huge`/`cosh`/`sinh`/`tanh`, and the whole `coroutine` table — none of
//!    which 1.12 has. This is 1189's *"a superset is not free"* one level below `_G`: an addon
//!    that writes `string.gmatch or string.gfind` (Ace does, on the very next line) picks the
//!    branch we leave standing, so leaving both standing chooses the wrong one for it.
//! 3. **The 5.0 compat globals the reference actually has get added** — `sort`, `foreach`,
//!    `foreachi`. `reference/1.12-globals.tsv` lists all three; we had the other seventeen of that
//!    family and not these.
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT have to do: the vararg `arg` table
//!
//! Lua 5.0 gives every vararg function an implicit `arg` table with an `n` field, and 1.12's
//! FrameXML uses it directly — `QuestTimerFrame_Update(...)` walks `for i=1, arg.n`, and so do
//! `FCFDropDown_LoadChannels`, `TradeSkill_OnEvent` and the GM-ticket and CVar families. Three of
//! our own transcriptions carry a note saying they rewrote it "the 5.1-native way" with
//! `select("#", ...)`, which reads as though the dialect demanded it.
//!
//! **It does not.** mlua's vendored 5.1 is built with `LUA_COMPAT_VARARG`, so `arg` and `arg.n`
//! are already there — measured, not assumed: `local function f(...) return arg.n end; f('a','b')`
//! answers 2 in this VM. That matters for 1751: a stock file using 5.0 varargs needs nothing from
//! this module, and the rewrite was a precaution against a problem we did not have.
//!
//! **And the other half of that, which costs an hour to rediscover: `...` is a DECLARATION token
//! here and nothing else.** This VM parses `function(x, ...)`, and then rejects every *use* of
//! `...` as an expression — `return ...`, `f(x, ...)`, and `local a = ...` at chunk level — with
//! `unexpected symbol near '...'`. `arg` and `unpack(arg)` are the only forwarding forms
//! ([`vararg_is_a_declaration_only`] pins all six). That is 5.0's own shape and exactly right for
//! the content we run, but it also binds anything WE write in Lua: an engine-side helper cannot
//! forward an unknown argument list without a table, so a verb whose arity matters (`GetPoint()`
//! vs `GetPoint(nil)`, `SetAllPoints()` vs `SetAllPoints(nil)`) has to stay on the Rust side.
//! Decision 2310 is where that bit — a Lua dispatcher for the Region method map would have been
//! ~4x cheaper than the Rust one and cannot be written in this dialect.
//!
//! ## The one known divergence, stated rather than hidden
//!
//! `table.insert`/`table.remove` stay on 5.1's `#t` border rather than consulting `getn`. **This
//! is byte-confirmed as a real divergence, not a suspicion**: the RE dispatch found that 1.12's
//! whole table library is `n`-based — `luaL_getn` is called by `insert`/`remove`/`concat`/`sort`/
//! `foreachi` *and* base `unpack`, and `insert`/`remove` **update** the stored size. So
//! `setn(t, 0)` on a non-empty table makes the next `insert` land at index 1 there and at
//! `#t + 1` here.
//!
//! It stays, and the trade was measured before it was made. Over the 218-addon corpus there are
//! 1,720 `setn` call sites; **1,471 pass 0** — always immediately after a
//! `for k in pairs(t) do t[k] = nil end` wipe, where `#t` is already 0 and the two agree — and 290
//! more pass `table.getn(source)` straight after copying that source, where they agree too. Fewer
//! than 20 sites could observe the difference, and none of them is reached at load. Replacing
//! `table.insert` with a Lua-level reimplementation to serve those would put an interpreted
//! function on the hottest path in every addon in existence. Revisit it if a *runtime* failure is
//! ever traced here — not before.
//!
//! ## Ground truth (decision 1196 — verified, no longer derived)
//!
//! This module first shipped with its member lists taken from Lua 5.0's published library
//! registrations and cross-checked against two artifacts we hold. An RE dispatch into
//! wow-5875-re then read the binary (`system/ui/scratch/lua-dialect.md`), and every list here is
//! now the array in the image:
//!
//! - **Lua 5.0**, on five independent discriminators — not just the `$Lua: Lua 5.0 …` blob at
//!   `0x811b30` but `LUA_REGISTRYINDEX = -10000` (5.1 uses −10002), a `luaT_eventname[]` pool with
//!   no `__mod`/`__len` (so **no `%` and no `#` operator**), and live `luaL_getn`/`luaL_setn`.
//! - **Five libraries are opened** by `InitLua 0x7039e0` and no more: base (a 36-entry array at
//!   `0x811e28` looped straight into `_G`), `string` (12, array `0x822d88`), `table` (8,
//!   `0x822d40`), `math` (24, `0x822c60`), and **`bit`** (8, `0x822c18`). `luaL_openlib` has four
//!   call sites image-wide, so `os`/`io`/`debug`/`coroutine` are absent by construction.
//! - **The compat globals are a Lua chunk, not C macros** — a 1310-byte `compat.lua` compiled into
//!   `.data` at `0x8722e8`, run last at init. That is why the set is a specific subset (`getn`
//!   aliased, `setn` deliberately not) rather than "whatever `LUA_COMPAT_*` gives you", and it is
//!   also where the **degree-based** bare `sin`/`cos`/`tan` come from — a convention this crate's
//!   stdlib layer had already reached independently.

    // `0x6f7be2` and enumerates two tags — `sub ecx,5; je` (LUA_TTABLE), `sub ecx,2; je`
    // (LUA_TUSERDATA) — then falls through at `0x6f7bee` to `mov eax,0x811bc0`, `&luaO_nilobject`

    // read, so a `__index` for a string cannot exist however it were installed. `G+0x80` is

    // census of every ×4-indexed operand across the text section finds no such read into writable
    // `.data` at all.
    //
    // The writer agrees from the other end. `lua_setmetatable 0x6f4020` takes the same two arms
    // (`0x6f409e`, `0x6f40a3`) into one `mov [edx+8], esi` — 5.0 puts `metatable` at offset 8 of
    // both `Table` and `Udata` — and every other tag falls to `0x6f40a8`'s `xor eax,eax`: return
    // 0, write nothing. `lua_getmetatable 0x6f3cf0` carries the identical `{5, 7}` switch. And the
    // layout settles it a third way: `luaS_newlstr 0x6f9d00` puts a string's **hash** at `+8`
    // (`0x6f9dbb`), the very offset the other two use for the metatable pointer.
    //
    // `luaopen_string 0x7fd810` is six instructions, `[0x7fd810, 0x7fd827)` — `push 0;
    // push 0x822d88; mov edx,0x871938; call luaL_openlib; mov eax,1; ret` — with no
    // `createmetatable` step, and `luaL_openlib` does not reach `0x6f4020` either. (wow-re
    // `system/ui/scratch/string-metatable-closure.md`, whose §5 cross-check produced all of the
    // above and retired `lua-dialect.md` §3's INFERRED flag on it. Two of ours came from that
    // note before it was re-read: it said "four instructions" while quoting six, and it stopped at
    // "no `lua_setmetatable` call" where the reader-side argument was available.)
    //
    // So this is not a policy choice about a superset — it is the type system. Note the reference
    // also *raises* rather than no-ops if an addon tries it itself: base `setmetatable 0x702a40`'s
