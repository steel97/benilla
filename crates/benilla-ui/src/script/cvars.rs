//! The **CVar table** — the client's named-console-variable store, engine side (decision 0954).
//!
//! In the reference every player setting is a CVar: a case-insensitively named string value with
//! a registered default, read and written from Lua through `GetCVar`/`SetCVar`/`GetCVarDefault`
//! (the 1.12 options panels are thin UI over this table). benilla keeps the same shape at the
//! same seam: the **host registers** the vars it implements
//! ([`super::UiScript::register_cvars`] — most backed by an engine knob, a few consumed by Lua
//! alone), Lua reads/writes them synchronously, and each Lua write lands on the **change queue** the host
//! drains per frame ([`super::UiScript::take_cvar_changes`]) to sync its resources and mark the
//! config file dirty. Host-side writes ([`super::UiScript::set_cvar_host`] — the loaded config,
//! an env override) do NOT ride the queue: the host already knows, and an echo would re-dirty
//! the file it just loaded.
//!
//! Values are **strings**, like the client's (`GetCVar` returns a string; consumers parse and
//! clamp at their own edge). An unknown name warns once and no-ops — a benilla CVar is either
//! host-registered or addon-declared through `RegisterCVar` (decision 1195), so an unknown key
//! is a typo or an unshipped feature, never a storage slot.
//!
//! **The table dies with the VM, so persistence bridges it** (decision 1291): in the reference
//! this store is engine memory and survives every `ReloadUI`; ours is per-VM state, replaced at
//! every login and reload (1290/1291). The host hands each fresh VM the config file's values
//! ([`super::UiScript::set_cvar_saved_base`]) before anything registers, and registration —
//! either kind — starts a key at its saved value. The host folds the dying VM's table back into
//! its persist state on the session edge, so the two halves meet.

/// - **`lua_isnumber` accepts a numeric string**, so `SetWorldDetail("2")` works there and here.
/// - **The getter is not the setter's inverse.** `0x488d70` reads only `smallCull`, seeds its
///   result at **2**, and runs `for i in 0..3 { if v <= tbl[i] { result = i } }` over the

///   the most. A shipped defect, and one of two: `OptionsFrame_SetDefaults` tests that same
///   descending table with ascending `elseif`s, so Restore Defaults always parks the slider at 0.
///
/// **Where benilla diverges, and why it is not the smallCull ladder.** `SmallCull` is a dead knob
/// in the reference — `[0x868620]` has one writer and no reader image-wide (wow-re
/// `cvar/scratch/graphics-cost-cvar-census.md` §8) — so its *only* consumer there is this getter,
/// which makes it storage for a stop the client keeps nowhere else. benilla keeps the stop:
/// [`CVAR_WORLD_DETAIL`] is it, and `frillDensity` is the same knob in the reference's unit. So the
