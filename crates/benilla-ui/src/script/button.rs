//! The `Button`/`CheckButton` method surface — per-kind behavior over the frame arena
//! (`CSimpleButton` `0x6eeab0` / `CSimpleCheckbox` `0x6eeb30`).
//!
//! Grounded in wow-re's byte-verified LoadXML tables (RF-28): the four state textures
//! (`Normal/Pushed/Disabled/Highlight`), the `ButtonText` fontstring + `text` attribute, the
//! `OnClick` script slot (`+0x4cc`); CheckButton runs Button's loader first and adds
//! `CheckedTexture`/`DisabledCheckedTexture` + the `checked` bool (`+0x4dc`). Which texture *shows*
//! is **latched on the transition**, not resolved at paint: [`ButtonState::set_state`] is the
//! client's `SetState 0x779790` and [`settle`] is where the derived inputs reach it. Two stated v1
//! gaps: the highlight draws with normal blending (the client ADD-blends it; the quad pass has no
//! blend modes yet), and `PushedTextOffset` is not modeled. Per-state label fonts *are*: the
//! `*FontObject` trio picks which object each state inherits and `extract` re-resolves it every
//! frame, while `SetFont` writes the button's own face/size/flags over all of them
//! ([`crate::widget::ButtonFont`]).
//!
//! Method resolution: CheckButton's table is consulted first, then Button's, then the shared frame
//! table — mirroring the client's class chain, and keeping duck-typing honest (`frame.SetChecked`
//! is nil on a plain Button; `frame.GetText` is nil on a plain Frame).

    // Byte-carved end to end by wow-re (decision 1505,

    // §5): the binding `0x780a60` is gates + a delegate to `CSimpleButton::SetFontString
    // 0x778d20`, which is the SAME function `SetText`'s lazy creation path funnels through — so
    // adopting and creating share their whole tail, and only the allocation differs.
    //
    // The idiom it exists for: build the label yourself so you can style and place it, then hand
    // it to the button so `SetText` and the per-state font machinery drive it. Quiver's
    // `Component/Select.wow.lua` builds every dropdown option row that way, and with the method
    // nil the row died on its first line — the second of B267's three walls.
    //
    // **It raises, in three distinct ways, and never silently no-ops on a bad argument** — the
    // first shape I built here was a lenient no-op and the bytes say otherwise:
    //
    //  · a **missing** argument, `nil`, a number, a string or a boolean → `lua_type(L,2) != TABLE`
    //    → `Usage: %s:SetFontString(fontstring)` (`0x87a100`). Missing and nil take the identical
    //    leg (`index2adr` answers NULL → type −1), so `SetFontString(nil)` **cannot clear the
    //    label from Lua**; the C++ clear exists but no binding reaches it.
    //  · a **table that is not a widget** → `%s:SetFontString(): Couldn't find 'this' in
    //    fontstring` (`0x87a160`).
    //  · a **Frame or a Texture** — anything that is not a FontString → `%s:SetFontString():
    //    Wrong object type, expected fontstring` (`0x87a124`), gated by an `IsA` against the
    //    FontString token, which a Texture fails.
    //
    // `%s` is the BUTTON's name (or `<unnamed>`), never the argument's. Zero return values.
    //
    // What `0x778d20` then does, all four clauses VERIFIED and all four here:
    //
    //  · **`new == old` is a total no-op** — the first compare, before anything is touched.
    //  · **the previous label is DESTROYED**, not orphaned (`old->vtable[0](1)`, the scalar
    //    deleting destructor, returning the storage to the FontString pool). So a button whose
    //    `SetText` already lazily made one does not leak a stray string behind the new label.
    //  · **the string is RE-PARENTED to the button and its draw layer forced to ARTWORK**
    //    (`0x77fd10(parent, 2, 1)` — layer id 2 in the client's own `.rdata 0x811a80` name table).
    //    Always, whatever it was parented to or drawn in before.
    //  · **it is anchored only if it has NO anchors of its own** (a scan of all nine
    //    `anchorPoints` slots): LEFT/RIGHT/CENTER by the justify bits of the **button's normal
    //    font** (`[button+0x390]`), to the matching point on the button — [`adopt_label`], the
    //    same `& 7` → LEFT(1)/RIGHT(4)/else-CENTER chain the FontString post-step runs, over the
    //    other word. (It used to reuse the post-step and read the string's own word; the two
    //    only agree when the normal font has no justify — decision 1996.)
    //  · **the button's per-state font is applied immediately** (`0x779810`) — the same
    //    [`adopt_label`] links the label to the normal font, so its query surface answers.

    //    (`xor eax,eax`), so a failed font load is undetectable from a Button. Returning `true`
    //    here would look harmless and would hand an addon a probe the client does not have.
    //  · **It never touches the label.** `SetFont`/`GetFont` do not dereference the FontString
    //    pointer `+0x338` at all, so styling a bare `CreateFrame("Button")` with no `<ButtonText>`
    //    is no error, no crash and **no lazy creation** — which is why the style is stored on the
    //    button ([`ButtonState::font`]) and `extract` applies it to whatever label exists. A later
    //    `SetText` (which *does* lazily create one, `0x778dc0`) then picks it up, so either call
    //    order works, exactly as the reference's does.
    //  · **It retunes all three embedded fonts** (normal `+0x33c`, disabled `+0x434`, highlight
    //    `+0x3b8`) and `GetFont` reads back only the normal one — see [`ButtonFont`] for why one
    //    record is the faithful shape for three identical writes.
    //
    // The argument gate is the shared impl's: arg2 `lua_isstring` and arg3 `lua_isnumber`, else
    // `luaL_error("Usage: %s:SetFont(\"font\", fontHeight [, flags])")` (`0x87c69c`). Both
