//! The pet action bar seam (decision 0982) — the eight bindings `PetActionBarFrame.lua` consumes
//! (`GetPetActionInfo`/`GetPetActionsUsable`/`GetPetActionCooldown`/`PetHasActionBar`/
//! `CastPetAction`/`TogglePetAutocast`/`IsPetAttackActive`/`PetStopAttack`) over an app-pushed
//! slot snapshot, in [`super::shapeshift`]'s two-way shape: the app resolves everything (which
//! slot is a command, a reaction or a spell; its icon, name, checked and autocast bits; its
//! cooldown) and pushes it ([`super::UiScript::set_pet_actions`]); the engine drains the click
//! intents ([`super::UiScript::take_pet_actions`] and kin) back out.
//!
//! **The engine holds no pet knowledge**: a slot here is "a name, a subtext, a texture, four bits
//! and a cooldown triple". In particular it does not know that a token slot's `name`/`texture` are
//! *the names of globals* rather than values — that convention belongs to the reference's own
//! `GetPetActionInfo` and is reproduced faithfully by the app, which sets `is_token` and lets the
//! Lua do the `getglobal` (the shipped `PetActionBarFrame.lua:98-104` fork).
//!
//! Return conventions are the 1.12 API's own, matching [`super::action`]: 1/nil booleans, and the
//! cooldown as `(start_s on the GetTime clock, duration_s, enable)` with the same
//! elapsed-goes-cold rule `GetActionCooldown` uses.
//!
//! Two later families joined the bar's eight through the same two-way seam, because they are about
//! the same unit and move on the same push: the **hunter stat block** ([`PetStats`], decision 1005)
//! that the pet paper doll and the happiness icon read, and the **right-click menu**
//! (`PetCanBeAbandoned`/`PetCanBeRenamed`/`PetAbandon`/`PetDismiss`/`PetRename`, decision 1066).
