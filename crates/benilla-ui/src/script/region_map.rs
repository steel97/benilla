//! **The Region method map, reached by frames and regions alike** — the 19 names of the client's
//! `0x87c9b8` table, each ONE callable that works on a Frame, a Texture or a FontString.
//!
//! ## The fact this exists for (byte-verified in `WoW.exe`, decision 1501)
//!
//! 1.12.1's widget inheritance is not a Lua metatable chain: every class owns a flat
//! `{name, lua_CFunction}` `.data` table, and its lookup probes that table and, on a miss,
//! **tail-calls exactly one base class's lookup** (wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/widget-api-batch-benilla.md`):
//!
//! ```text
//! Region   0x87c9b8 (19)  lookup 0x7a2ea0  → TERMINAL (root)
//! ├─ Frame        0x878ec0 (68)  lookup 0x778590 → 0x7a2ea0
//! ├─ Texture      0x87c128 (22)  lookup 0x79c620 → 0x7a2ea0
//! └─ FontString   0x87c1d8 (32)  lookup 0x79ee20 → 0x7a2ea0
//! ```
//!
//! Parsing the two tables out of the image directly, **`Frame ∩ Region = ∅`**: not one of the 19
//! is re-registered by Frame, so every Frame-derived class reaches the *same* function a Texture
//! does. `WorldFrame.GetHeight` **is** `0x7a2030`, byte-for-byte the function
//! `someTexture:GetHeight()` resolves to.
//!
//! That is why this is not a curiosity. The idiom
//!
//! ```lua
//! local _Height = WorldFrame.GetHeight     -- pull the method off ANY widget, once
//! …
//! local h = _Height(someTexture)           -- and apply it to ANY other
//! ```
//!
//! is ordinary, correct 1.12 Lua. Quiver's `Api/Index.wow.lua` is built on it
//! (`_Height = WorldFrame.GetHeight`, `_Width = WorldFrame.GetWidth`), and benilla raised
//! `stale or invalid frame handle` on it, from inside the addon's `VARIABLES_LOADED` handler,
//! **before** the handler's last line got to publish `Quiver.CastPetAction` — which is the whole
//! of bug B267. One split method surface, one nil field, one dead addon.
//!
//! ## Why it is a bridge rather than a merge
//!
//! Our two implementations of each name are not redundant: a frame's size reads `layout_inputs`
//! and divides its edges by `GetEffectiveScale`, a region's reads `region_data` and does not; a
//! frame's `GetParent` can answer nil, a region's never can; a region's `GetPoint` resolves a
//! `relativeTo` that may be a sibling *region*. Those differences are correct, and they are the
//! same shape the reference has: `Region:GetHeight 0x7a2030` reads the receiver's layout
//! sub-object and calls `[vtable+0x20]`, which `CSimpleFontString` **overrides**. One name, one
//! entry point, per-kind behaviour behind it.
//!
//! So each of the 19 becomes one function that resolves the receiver *first* and then hands the
//! whole argument list to the arm that owns that kind — and that single function is written into
//! every method table the reference's chain would reach: the frame table, the region table, the
//! Texture and FontString leaf tables, and the title region's narrower copy. Identity holds the
//! way the binary's does — `WorldFrame.GetHeight == someTexture.GetHeight` is true here too.
//!
//! **Exactly the 19, and no more.** `Show`/`Hide`/`IsShown`/`IsVisible`/`SetAlpha`/`GetAlpha` look
//! like they belong and do not: Frame and Texture each register their *own*, at different
//! addresses (`texture-fontstring-method-split.md` §3), so `WorldFrame.Show(someTexture)` fails on
//! the real client and must keep failing here. (`SetSize` used to sit outside the 19 for the
//! opposite reason — in neither table because 1.12 has no such verb at all; decision 2142 removed
//! it rather than filing it.) The map is the unit.
