//! **Client-identity and script-evaluation verbs** — the small engine globals an addon asks for
//! before it does anything else (1188 phase 5, prioritised by the phase 6 corpus).
//!
//! These are not a guess at what addons want. They are the top of the measured demand list: over a
//! 218-addon vanilla corpus, `GetBuildInfo` is called by 69 addons and `RunScript` by 52, and both
//! are called *at file scope* — so a missing one does not degrade an addon, it stops the addon's
//! very first chunk with `attempt to call global … (a nil value)`. `GetBuildInfo` alone was the
//! first error for the whole Ace/Atlas/AtlasLoot family, which is a large slice of the ecosystem.
//!
//! ## The host-fed pair (decision 1195)
//!
//! `GetRealmName` and `GetFramerate` are the next two down that list — 24 addons are stopped dead
//! by `GetRealmName` at file scope, and it is the **top runtime wall in the corpus** after the
//! dialect gap. Both read a slot the app pushes, the same shape as the zone-text family: the
//! engine owns the verb, the host owns the fact.
//!
//! `GetRealmName` returning `""` before a realm is known is deliberate and is what the reference
//! does at the glue screen. An addon keys its saved variables on it (`db[GetRealmName()]`), so
//! answering `nil` would make that a `table index is nil` error one call deeper — the failure mode
//! we have been paying for all arc.

    // (`0x704b06 push ecx`, the fourth argument of `luaL_loadbuffer 0x6f5690` at `0x704b0c`)
    // untouched. No `=`, no `@` — so `luaO_chunkid 0x6f5c40` renders it by its third rule,
    // `[string "…"]`, exactly as `loadstring`'s default source-name does (2136 §4). `=[RunScript]`
    // was a placeholder that rendered plausibly; `=` is chunkid's *print-verbatim* marker and
    // `[RunScript]` is not a literal the image contains.
    //
    // **2 · A bad argument is a SILENT NO-OP, not a raise.** `0x48b988 call 0x6f3510`
    // (`lua_isstring` — tag-based, so a *number* passes) failing takes `0x48b98f je` straight to
    // `0x48b9f3 xor eax,eax; ret`. So does a NULL from `lua_tostring` (`0x48b99f`) and an EMPTY
    // string (`0x48b9a1 cmp byte ptr [eax],0`). There is no `luaL_error 0x6f4940` anywhere in the
    // function — `RunScript(nil)` does nothing at all.

    // **3 · An error does NOT reach the caller.** `0x704ae0` pushes the registered error handler
    // from the registry first (`0x704afe`, `[0x8722c8]` at `LUA_REGISTRYINDEX 0xffffd8f0`) and
    // runs the chunk as `lua_pcall(L, 0, 0, -2)` (`0x704b68`); a *compile* failure takes the other
    // leg and pcalls that same handler with the message (`0x704b42`). Either way the raise is
    // consumed, the red line is the handler's doing, and the caller's next statement runs. Raising
    // here made one bad `RunScript` abort whatever ran it — a macro could take FrameXML down with
