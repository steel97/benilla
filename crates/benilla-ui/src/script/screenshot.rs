//! **`Screenshot()`** — the engine verb behind the print-screen key (decision 1487).
//!
//! One global and one counter. The reference's binding is `SCREENSHOT` → `TakeScreenshot()`
//! (FrameXML `Bindings.xml`), whose body hides the status text and then calls this engine
//! function; the engine answers later with `SCREENSHOT_SUCCEEDED` or `SCREENSHOT_FAILED`, which
//! is what puts "Screen Captured" on screen. **The answer is an EVENT, never a return value** —
//! and that is the whole mechanism that keeps the message out of the file it announces: the
//! capture is already taken by the time anything can say so.
//!
//! A **count**, like [`super::client`]'s `RequestTimePlayed` and `ConfirmBinder`: the request
//! carries no payload (the app owns the window, the folder and the clock), so two calls in a frame
//! are two captures rather than one collapsed intent. The app drains it in
//! [`crate::script::UiScript::take_screenshot_asks`].
