//! The player-summon **Era API surface** (decision 1747) — four globals, one snapshot.
//!
//! These are the whole Lua side of being summoned, and they exist because the reference's
//! `CONFIRM_SUMMON` dialog is written against exactly them (`StaticPopup.lua:1336-1357` +
//! `UIParent.lua:551-552`): the `CONFIRM_SUMMON` event raises the dialog with **no arguments at
//! all**, `OnShow` seeds its countdown from [`GetSummonConfirmTimeLeft`], the popup engine's
//! per-tick text re-reads [`GetSummonConfirmSummoner`] and [`GetSummonConfirmAreaName`], and
//! `OnAccept` calls [`ConfirmSummon`]. `reference/1.12-globals.tsv` lists all four as
//! `function`/`engine`, and there is **no fifth**: 1.12 has no `CancelSummon`, because declining
//! sends no packet.
//!
//! **Why the three getters read a pushed snapshot rather than arguments.** The reference keeps the
//! request in four engine globals — `[0xb4e358]/[0xb4e35c]` the summoner guid, `[0xb4e354]` the
//! zone id, `[0xb4e350]` the deadline — and each getter resolves *at call time*: the summoner
//! through the name cache (`DBCache::NameCache::GetRecord 0x55f080`, `""` on a miss), the area
//! through `AreaTable.dbc` (`""` when the row is missing), the time left as
//! `(deadline − now) / 1000`. Both resolves need host state this crate does not have, so the app
//! does them and pushes the answers every frame ([`super::UiScript::set_summon_confirm`]). The
//! observable is identical, including the one that matters: a summoner whose name has not arrived
//! yet renders `""` and then fills itself in on a later tick, because the dialog re-reads the
//! getter every OnUpdate.
//!
//! `ConfirmSummon()` takes no arguments and queues only a count, [`super::binder`]'s shape and for
//! its reason: the app holds the guid that goes on the wire.
