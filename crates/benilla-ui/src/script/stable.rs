//! The stable-master bindings (decision 1676) — the hunter stable window's Lua surface, the same
//! two-way seam as [`super::bank`] and [`super::trainer`]: the app pushes a **stable snapshot**
//! ([`UiScript::set_stable`] — the wire's pet rows already resolved to icon/family/loyalty/diet
//! strings), and the Lua's click/purchase/close calls queue outbound **intents** the app drains.
//!
//! ## Three slots, and the current pet is one of them
//!
//! The window shows **`0..=2`**: slot `0` is the pet at the player's side, slots `1` and `2` are the
//! two stable slots a hunter buys (5875 ships exactly two — `StableSlotPrices.dbc` has two rows,
//! vmangos's `MAX_PET_STABLES` is 2, and the reference's `NUM_PET_STABLE_SLOTS` is 2). The wire is
//! 1-based over these; [`benilla_protocol::messages::StabledPet::slot`] already rebased it, so
//! everything here speaks the reference UI's own indices.
//!
//! **Slot 0 can be occupied while the player has no pet out.** A hunter whose pet is dismissed (or
//! merely too far away to be summoned) still gets a slot-0 row from the server, read off the
//! character-pet cache — which is exactly why the reference falls back to `GetStablePetInfo(0)`
//! when `UnitExists("pet")` is false (`PetStable.lua:131-146`) instead of showing an empty slot.
//!
//! ## What the snapshot resolves, and why the app does it
//!
//! The wire names a `creature_template` entry and a loyalty *level*; the window wants an icon, a
//! localized family word, a loyalty *name* and a diet list. Every one of those is a catalog join
//! the app already owns for the live pet ([`super::pet`], decisions 1005/1062), so the app does the
//! join once and pushes strings — this module never sees a DBC. The one join with no live-pet twin
//! is the icon of a pet that is *not* summoned: it comes from the creature query's display id,
//! which is why that field stopped being discarded (decision 1676).
//!
//! ## The drag rides the cursor at mode 10
//!
//! `PickupStablePet` puts the pet on the **global cursor** under payload mode 10
//! ([`super::cursor::CursorPayload::StablePet`]), carrying the stable index the grab recorded.
//!
//! This corrects what benilla shipped first. The original build made the drag frame-local on the
//! strength of wow-re's payload-mode table, which recorded mode 10 as "class/talent ability (DBC)"
//! — so the census read as "there is no stable-pet mode". The stable-master carve found that
//! `0x495020` **is** the stabled-pet grab and that `[0xb4d900] = 10` is written at exactly one site
//! image-wide, inside it; wow-re corrected its own note in the same round
//! (`system/ui/scratch/stable-master-window.md` §9). Decision 1677.
//!
//! ## Two return conventions that are the API, not details
//!
//! `ClickStablePet` returns **exactly one value, always**, and which one is keyed *solely* on
//! whether the cursor was holding a pet — never on whether a packet went out:
//!
//! - **a plain click** (no payload) is a pure select and pushes the number `1.0` on all three of
//!   its legs, so it is **always truthy** and the reference always repaints;
//! - **a drop** pushes **nil** on every leg, including the ones that send a packet, so the
//!   reference never repaints from the drop — the repaint comes from the server's next list.
//!
//! Getting this backwards is invisible in a test that only checks the packets and very visible in
//! play: the window would repaint off a stale snapshot on every drag and skip the repaint on every
//! click.
