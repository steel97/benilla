//! **`SlashCmdList` dispatch** — how an addon gets a `/command` (decision 1195).
//!
//! The single most-wanted *table* in the corpus. 26 of 218 addons stop on
//! `attempt to index global 'SlashCmdList'` — the top runtime wall after the dialect gap — because
//! the registration idiom is three lines at file scope:
//!
//! ```lua
//! SLASH_MYADDON1 = "/myaddon"
//! SLASH_MYADDON2 = "/ma"
//! SlashCmdList["MYADDON"] = function(msg) … end
//! ```
//!
//! …and the third line raises the moment the table is missing.
//!
//! ## The resolution is the reference's own, transcribed
//!
//! `ChatEdit_ParseText` (ChatFrame.lua) walks **`SlashCmdList`'s keys**, not a name list: for each
//! `index` it reads `SLASH_<index>1`, `SLASH_<index>2`, … until the first gap, comparing each
//! against the typed command case-insensitively. The aliases are data and the handlers are code,
//! joined by the index name — decision 0881 built our own table on exactly that shape, and this is
//! the same walk over the half addons own.
//!
//! Two details of that walk are load-bearing and both are easy to get wrong:
//!
//! - **The handler's argument is the rest of the line, not the rest of the *word*.** The reference
//!   passes `strsub(text, strlen(cmdString) + 2)` — everything after the alias and one space — so
//!   `/myaddon set foo 3` hands the handler `"set foo 3"`, spaces intact. An addon's own parser
//!   starts there.
//! - **The walk stops at the first gap.** `SLASH_X1` and `SLASH_X3` with no `SLASH_X2` means `X3`
//!   is unreachable, in the reference and here. That is a property of the data format, not a bug
//!   to repair.
//!
//! ## Where the table lives, and the divergence that comes with it
//!
//! `SlashCmdList` is **FrameXML's**, not the engine's (`reference/1.12-globals.tsv` says
//! `table framexml`), so ours is declared in our transcribed `ChatFrame.xml` exactly as the
//! reference declares it in `ChatFrame.lua` — 1190's engine/FrameXML split applied to a table
//! rather than a function.
//!
//! **The divergence, stated:** benilla's *own* commands (`/who`, `/invite`, `/cast`, …) are
//! dispatched in Rust ([`crate`]'s host owns them) and are **not** entries in `SlashCmdList`. In
//! the reference they are, so an addon that tests `if SlashCmdList["WHO"] then` or hooks one by
//! wrapping the entry sees an empty table here and does nothing. That is a real, observable gap;
//! it is bounded (nothing in the corpus does it) and the fix is to move our command handlers into
//! transcribed FrameXML, which is a much larger piece of work than this one.
