//! **`SendAddonMessage`** — the addon-to-addon channel (decision 1235).
//!
//! ```lua
//! SendAddonMessage(prefix, message [, distribution])
//! ```
//!
//! The corpus's single most-wanted missing global (24 of 218 addons name it). It is how an addon
//! talks to *its own copy running on someone else's client*: oRA2 broadcasting a CTRA raid status,
//! KLHThreatMeter shipping a threat table, BigWigs syncing a boss timer.
//!
//! ## 1.12.1 has no addon opcode — the whole thing is one sentinel in the language field
//!
//! There is no `CMSG_ADDON_MESSAGE`. `SendAddonMessage` composes its two strings into ONE chat
//! line, sends it as an ordinary `CMSG_MESSAGECHAT` on an ordinary chat lane, and sets the
//! `language` field to `LANG_ADDON` (`0xFFFFFFFF`). That sentinel is the *only* thing separating
//! addon data from speech, on both sides of the wire.
//!
//! VERIFIED in `WoW.exe` (5875) — wow-re `system/ui/scratch/addon-chat-law.md` §5, a §5 trio
//! (three independent derivations, orchestrator-arbitrated). The binding is `0x49f920`, body
//! `[0x49f920, 0x49fb2a)`:
//!
//! ```text

//! 49f97f-49f987: BOTH empty -> luaL_error("Usage: SendAddonMessage(...)")

//! 49f9b3: call 0x64a7f0            ; _snprintf(dst, 0x800, "%s\t%s", prefix, message)
//! 49fa0b/49fa15: lua_isstring(L,3) ; absent/non-string -> esi = 1 = PARTY (0x49fa06/0x49fa12)
//! 49fa3f: cmp esi,0x01 ; je        ; PARTY
//! 49fa44: cmp esi,0x02 ; je        ; RAID
//! 49fa49: cmp esi,0x03 ; je        ; GUILD
//! 49fa4e: cmp esi,0x5c ; je        ; BATTLEGROUND
//! 49fa53: push 0x844b44 ; call 0x6f4940   ; luaL_error("Unknown addon chat type")
//! 49facf: call 0x418190             ; u32 opcode 0x95 = CMSG_MESSAGECHAT

//! 49faf0: call 0x418430             ; CString message
//! ```
//!
//! Three consequences the shape forces, and each is a thing an implementation gets wrong:
//!
//! - **The prefix is not a wire field.** It is glued to the message with a literal TAB and the
//!   pair rides as one C-string. The receiver splits on the FIRST tab (`0x49a8d0`, the same note
//!   §3). Nothing on the wire knows a prefix exists.
//! - **There is no `target` argument.** The body fetches Lua indices `1`, `2` and `3` and no
//!   other — there is no arg-4 fetch anywhere in its 522 bytes. 1.12 has no whispered addon
//!   message; the modern 4-argument `SendAddonMessage(prefix, msg, "WHISPER", target)` does not
//!   exist here, and `"WHISPER"` is not even a legal distribution (below).
//! - **`_snprintf` with size `0x800` truncates silently at 2047 bytes + NUL** (`0x64a861`-
//!   `0x64a868`). No error, no tell.
//!
//! ## The distribution set is FOUR, and it is narrower than the server's
//!
//! [`AddonDistribution`] is the whole legal set — `PARTY`/`RAID`/`GUILD`/`BATTLEGROUND`. Two
//! independent mechanisms in the binary name the identical four, which is the cross-check that
//! settles it: the send-side whitelist above, and the *receive* side's remap table (`0x49aff4`,
//! 92 bytes = `00 01 02` then `04` x88 then `03`) feeding the 5-entry jump table `0x49afe0`, whose
//! four real arms push `"PARTY"`/`"RAID"`/`"GUILD"`/`"BATTLEGROUND"` and whose default pushes the
//! literal `"UNKNOWN"`.
//!
//! **vmangos is WIDER than the client** and that gap is deliberate, not a bug to close:
//! `WorldSession::IsLanguageAllowedForChatType` also permits `LANG_ADDON` on OFFICER,
//! RAID_LEADER, RAID_WARNING, BATTLEGROUND_LEADER and CHANNEL. A real client *accepts* addon
//! traffic inbound on all of those (the receive-side discriminator is language-only and reads no
//! type byte) while refusing to *send* on them. We match the client, not the server: the four.
//!
//! An unknown token and a known-but-not-whitelisted one (`"SAY"`, `"WHISPER"`, `"CHANNEL"`,
//! `"OFFICER"`, `"RAID_WARNING"` — all of which DO resolve in the shared 13-record type table at
//! `0x49f7a0`) converge on the **same** `luaL_error` at `0x49fa53`. That is why this module does
//! not model the 13-record table at all: its output is unobservable through this binding, because
//! both paths raise the identical error text. The note says so outright — *"a caller cannot tell a
//! typo from a rejection."*
//!
//! ## The seam
//!
//! [`super::chat_send`]'s shape: the verb validates, composes, and queues an [`AddonSend`]; the app
//! drains it ([`super::UiScript::take_addon_sends`]) into `ClientCommand::AddonMessage` and the
//! writer puts it on the wire. Plain data across the boundary — this crate holds no wire types —
//! but the distribution crosses as an **enum, not a token string**, so the app's map is total and
//! the "unknown type silently guessed into SAY" failure is impossible by construction rather than
//! by a second validation nobody remembers to write.
//!
//! ## The `|`-escape scan — carved, and it is a forward SKIP, not a flat scan (decision 1236)
//!
//! `0x49f9bb`-`0x49fa04`, running on the **composed** buffer (cursor `0x49f9bd
//! lea ecx,[ebp-0x81c]`, byte-identical to the `_snprintf` destination `lea` at `0x49f9a7`) and
//! strictly **before** the type whitelist — `0x49fa06` is the sole predecessor of `0x49fa0b`, so a
//! payload with a bad escape *and* a bad distribution reports the escape and never fetches
//! argument 3. See [`validate_escapes`] for the loop; the two facts that make it non-obvious:
//!
//! - **`|c` skips PAST its closer.** `strstr` (`0x64b4f0`, case-**sensitive** — the binary has a
//!   folding twin at `0x64b540` and deliberately does not use it here) finds the first literal
//!   `"|r"` and the cursor becomes `lea esi,[eax+0x2]` (`0x49f9f4`), i.e. beyond it. That single
//!   `lea` is why a well-formed `|r` never reaches the loop head — under a flat scan its own `|`
//!   would be a `|` followed by `r` and every colour escape in the game would raise.
//! - **An unmatched `|c` is not an error.** It NUL-terminates in place at the opening `|`
//!   (`0x49fa6a`) and then `0x49fa6d jmp 0x49fa06` lands on the accept path — **the truncated text
//!   is transmitted**, with no error and no signal to the addon.
//!
//! Because the scan runs on the composed buffer, prefix and message are validated as **one
//! string**: a `|c` opened in the prefix can be closed by a `|r` in the message, and an unmatched
//! one in the prefix truncates the payload to a bare prefix with no tab at all.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately NOT here, named rather than left to be found
//!
//! - **The no-group silent return** (`0x49fa9f`-`0x49faab` -> `0x49fb21`): the reference drops an
//!   effective-PARTY send when `[0xbc6f48]`/`[0xbc6f4c]` are both zero, with no error and no
//!   packet. Those two are **`partyMemberGuid[0].lo/.hi` — element 0 of a FOUR-entry array**
//!   (stride 8, limit `0x20`; `Ui\PartyFrame.cpp`), not "the party GUID" as 1235 called them:
//!   slot 0 being non-zero is a sound "in a party" test only because `SMSG_GROUP_LIST` refills the
//!   roster lowest-slot-first (decision 1236 §3).
//!   We do not implement it, and the reason is a window we have and the reference does
//!   not: its gate reads the live group GUID, ours would read [`super::party::PartyState`], which
//!   is `default()` between world entry and the first `SMSG_GROUP_LIST`. Implementing it would
//!   silently swallow a real broadcast in that window — the exact failure this verb exists to
//!   avoid. Not implementing it costs one `CMSG_MESSAGECHAT` that vmangos discards
//!   (`HandleChatMessageOpcode`'s `if (!group) return`), which is the same observable nothing.
