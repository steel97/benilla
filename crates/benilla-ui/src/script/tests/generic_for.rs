//! Lua 5.0's iterator-less generic-for, restored in the vendored VM (decision 1215).
//!
//! `for k, v in someTable do` is Lua 5.0 syntax that 5.1 removed at the OPCODE level. 183 of 218
//! corpus addons are reached by it and it is the first session-start error for 60 of them — three
//! quarters of everything that breaks in a running session. The fix is 5.0's `OP_TFORPREP` folded
//! into `OP_TFORLOOP` in `third_party/lua-src/lua-5.1.5/lvm.c`.
//!
//! Each test below pins one detail that was byte-verified in the real 1.12.1 client (wow-5875-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/lua-generic-for.md`), because each is a place where a *reasonable* guess
//! diverges from what the client does. The `__call` case is the sharpest: two of the three
//! conditions somebody would naturally write for this behave differently there.
