//! The spellbook (decision 0216 §8, slice 5) — the spell **source** for the cursor payload
//! system: a read-only book model the app builds from `PlayerActions.spells`
//! (`SMSG_INITIAL_SPELLS`), the same two-way seam shape as [`super::merchant`]/[`super::action`]:
//! the app pushes a **book snapshot** ([`UiScript::set_spellbook`] — tabs + the flat slot list,
//! already resolved to name/rank/icon/passive by the app's `benilla_formats::SpellCatalog` ×
//! skill-line join), and `CastSpell`/`PickupSpell` queue outbound intents the app drains
//! ([`UiScript::take_spell_casts`] / the cursor seam's own `CursorPayload::Spell` arm — decision
//! 0216 §1). The engine holds no spell KNOWLEDGE (icons/ranks/skill lines are the app's job) — a
//! slot is "a spell id, a name, a rank, a texture, and a passive bit".
//!
//! ## The book-id seam (decision 0218 §4's byte-verified 0-based book slot)
//!
//! The ref's own FrameXML computes a **1-based, per-tab-cumulative "book id"**
//! (`SpellBookFrame.lua`'s `SpellBook_GetSpellID`: `buttonId + tabOffset + 12*(page-1)`, where
//! `buttonId` is a spell button's own 1..12 `id=` attribute and `tabOffset` is
//! `GetSpellTabInfo`'s own `offset` return) and passes that SAME id, unmodified, to every one of
//! `GetSpellName`/`GetSpellTexture`/`IsSpellPassive`/`CastSpell`/`PickupSpell`. 0218 §4 byte-read
//! `PickupSpell`'s own argument as a **0-based book slot** — so the real client's Lua↔C++ glue
//! does the `-1` itself, invisibly to FrameXML. This engine keeps the ref's exact Lua-facing
//! convention (every binding below takes the SAME 1-based-cumulative `id` a transcribed
//! `SpellBookFrame.xml` computes and passes verbatim, so the transcription needs no special
//! casing) and does the byte-verified `-1` at THIS one seam ([`slot_index`]) before indexing
//! [`SpellBookState::slots`] (0-based, flat, tab order). `GetSpellTabInfo`'s pushed `offset` is
//! therefore exactly each tab's 0-based START index into `slots` — the app computes it as the
//! running sum of every earlier tab's `num_spells` (tab 1's is `0`, so its first spell's book id
//! is `1`, matching the ref's own "first tab's first spell is id 1").
//!
//! ## The pet book (decision 1032 — live; 0216 §8's deferral is retired)
//!
//! `BOOKTYPE_PET` selects a **second slot list** ([`PetBookState`]), fed from `SMSG_PET_SPELLS`'
//! own spell tail. Every `bookType`-taking binding is a two-way fork ([`book_slot`]) exactly as the
//! reference's are — `isPet ? [0xb6f098 + 4*i] : [0xb700f0 + 4*i]`, written out once per binding —
//! and the three pet-only bindings (`HasPetSpells`, `GetSpellAutocast`, `ToggleSpellAutocast`) live
//! here with them.
//!
//! Two asymmetries are the API and not tidiable away:
//!
//! - `GetNumSpellTabs`/`GetSpellTabInfo` take **no** `bookType` and only ever answer the player's
//!   skill lines. That is the reference's own signature: the pet book has no tabs, and
//!   `SpellBookFrame_Update` hides the whole skill-line strip while it is up.
//! - `PickupSpell` and `CastSpell` produce a **different kind of thing** on the pet side — a pet
//!   action word on the cursor (`0x494e20`, cursor modes 1-7) and a `CMSG_PET_ACTION` on the wire
//!   (`0x4b34ce`) — rather than a spell payload and a player cast. See each binding.
//!
//! `BOOKTYPE_SPELL`/`BOOKTYPE_PET` are installed as plain Lua globals here rather than left to the
//! transcribed XML's own `<Script>` block (the ref's actual home for them, `SpellBookFrame.lua:
//! 5-6`, and this crate's usual house rule for Era top-level constants) — the one deliberate
//! exception, so this module's OWN engine-level tests can drive the pet-deferral path without
//! loading a real `SpellBookFrame.xml`.
