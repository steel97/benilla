//! The `ColorSelect` method surface — the `CSimpleColorSelect` widget behavior over the kind tag
//! (factory `0x6eef90`; LoadXML `0x78b3f0`, script-map `0x78b4f0`, RF-28
//! `rf28-typed-widget-loadxml.md`). The widget holds one colour and fires `OnColorSelect` (its own
//! script slot, `+0x338`) when that colour is set.
//!
//! **Why this is engine-side and not four lines of Lua on `ColorPickerFrame`.** The corpus creates
//! its own: `TipBuddy.xml` declares two `<ColorSelect>` frames (`TBColorPickerFrame`,
//! `TBColorPickerFrame_Text`), each with its own `<OnColorSelect>` handler, and drives them with
//! `SetColorRGB`/`GetColorRGB`. A method table hung on the one frame `assets/ui` ships would leave
//! those two with a widget that has no methods — the "privileged built-in" failure the `.toc`
//! header names. So it lives with `Slider`/`StatusBar`, in the per-kind dispatcher.
//!
//! **The colour law is byte-verified, and it is not what it looks like.** This module was first
//! written against the obvious model — store three RGB bytes, hand them back — and a §5 cross-check
//! dispatched into wow-re for exactly this question corrected it
//! (`system/ui/scratch/colorselect-color-law.md`, 2026-08-11: three independent derivations plus an
//! emulated Unicorn oracle over the four helpers' own bytes). Two corrections, both load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **The state is HSV `f32`, not RGB** — see [`ColorSelectState`] for the members and why.
//! 2. **The round trip is not the identity.** Inbound and outbound use *different* quantizers
//!    (round-half-up vs floor), so `SetColorRGB` → `GetColorRGB` returns a channel one step low on
//!    **9.7527 % of all 256³ reachable colours** — and, because the map is idempotent-free, the
//!    FrameXML idiom `r,g,b = f:GetColorRGB() … f:SetColorRGB(r,g,b)` **ratchets** a channel
//!    downward one step per cycle. `SetColorRGB(0, 1, 1)` fires `OnColorSelect(0, 254/255, 1)`.
//!    Every Ace2/Dewdrop colour option is that idiom, once per open-and-accept, so this is visible
//!    behaviour, not a curiosity — it is transcribed because it is what the client computes, and
//!    [`ColorSelectState`]'s docs record the one-line change that would undo it if it ever must go.
//!
//! **`SetColorRGB` fires `OnColorSelect`, synchronously, on every call.** VERIFIED at the bytes:
//! `0x78ed01 call 0x78bae0` is a plain fall-through of the last basic block, and inside it the only
//! conditional (`0x78bafd`) tests whether a handler is *bound*. There is deliberately **no
//! change-gate** — the contrast with [`crate::widget::SliderState::store_value`] is real and was
//! verified the other way in the same pass (`CSimpleSlider::SetValue 0x789930` skips on equal at
//! `0x789a16`): two sibling widgets in one band, opposite gating. It matters here because a caller
//! re-setting the colour it already holds still expects its `func` to run — which is exactly how a
//! Dewdrop colour row opens, and how the reference's own `ColorPickerFrame.xml` paints its preview
//! swatch (nothing else ever writes it).
//!
//! **The four texture accessors are carried** (`SetColorWheelTexture` `0x78de90` /
//! `SetColorWheelThumbTexture` `0x78e160` / `SetColorValueTexture` `0x78e450` /
//! `SetColorValueThumbTexture` `0x78e720`, plus the getters `0x78dd80`/`0x78e070`). They had zero
//! callers in the 218-addon corpus and waited for one under decision 1195; the customer that
//! arrived is our own `ColorPickerFrame.xml`, whose four elements the XML loader installs through
//! exactly these — two of them with **no file at all**, because the disc and the strip are pixels
//! the client computes and the app renderer now computes too (decision 1592, and wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/colorselect-drawn-appearance.md` for what it draws).
//!
//! **NOT carried, still waiting for a customer (decision 1195):** `SetColorHSV`/`GetColorHSV`
//! (`0x78e920`/`0x78ea00`) — zero corpus callers, though the state they would read and write is
//! now the right shape for them, and [`ColorSelectState::set_hsv`] is already the store they'd
//! use (three *raw* `f32` — no clamp, no quantize, zero `fcom` in its body), because the drag path
//! needs exactly that.
