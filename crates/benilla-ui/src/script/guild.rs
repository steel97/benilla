//! The guild **Era API surface** — roster, ranks, notes, MOTD, and the membership verbs
//! (decision 1257).
//!
//! [`super::social`]'s shape exactly: the app pushes a [`GuildState`] snapshot built from its own
//! wire mirror ([`UiScript::set_guild`]) and the getters here read that plain data; every verb
//! queues a [`GuildRequest`] the app drains ([`UiScript::take_guild_requests`]) into the matching
//! `CMSG_*` send. No ECS or net reach from the engine (decision 0068 §3).
//!
//! **The snapshot is already display-ready** — member names, localized class names, zone names,
//! rank names, and the last-online decomposition — because every one of those is a *lookup the
//! engine owns* in the real client too. Unlike the friend list and `/who`, the guild roster
//! carries level/class/zone for **offline** members as well (the server keeps them in the guild
//! table), which is why those columns stay populated and merely grey out.
//!
//! **Guild identity and guild roster are two different caches, and this file joins them.**
//! `SMSG_GUILD_ROSTER` carries the MOTD, the info text, the rank *rights* and the members — but
//! **not** the guild's name and **not** the rank *names*. Those come only from
//! `SMSG_GUILD_QUERY_RESPONSE`, which answers a `CMSG_GUILD_QUERY(guildId)` with the name plus a
//! fixed array of ten rank names. The app does the joining before it pushes; [`GuildState`] is
//! the joined result.
//!
//! **Two index bases coexist, and callers must convert.** A roster row's `rankIndex` (from
//! `GetGuildRosterInfo`) is **0-based**, `0` = guild master — the reference computes
//! `maxRankIndex = GuildControlGetNumRanks() - 1` and compares roster indices against it
//! (`FriendsFrame.lua:338`, `:393-398`). The whole `GuildControl*` family is **1-based**, driven
//! straight off dropdown IDs `1..GuildControlGetNumRanks()` (`:820-822`, `:855-857`, `:866-868`).
//! Mixing them silently promotes the wrong rank, so every conversion here is spelled out.
//!
//! **Rank-control edits are staged, and the staging is write-only.** `GuildControlSetRank(i)`
//! loads rank `i` into [`GuildRankEdit`], `GuildControlSetRankFlag(idx, on)` writes one staged
//! slot, and `GuildControlSaveRank(name)` folds the thirteen slots over a freshly re-read *live*
//! baseline and queues one intent. The buffer is deliberately *not* part of the pushed snapshot:
//! it is scratch the popup owns between open and Accept, and a snapshot push mid-edit would
//! otherwise discard the user's unsaved checkbox clicks.
//!
//! The counter-intuitive half, and it is verified: **`GuildControlGetRankFlags` reads the LIVE
//! rights, never the staging buffer.** A checkbox click is invisible through the getter until the
//! save round-trips and a fresh roster lands. Reading the buffer back would feel more responsive
//! and would be a different client.
//!
//! **The roster is never filtered.** `GetGuildRosterInfo`, `GetGuildRosterLastOnline` and
//! `SetGuildRosterSelection` all address the *whole* member list; only `GetNumGuildMembers`
//! respects the show-offline toggle, and indices past it are valid and return real offline
//! members. See [`GuildState::num_members`] — this is the opposite of the obvious design, and
//! collapsing the two is the mistake it exists to prevent.
//!
//! **Era booleans are `1`/`nil`, never `true`/`false`** — `IsInGuild`, `IsGuildLeader` and every
//! `Can*` predicate below. The FrameXML branches on truthiness and stores the result, so a
//! `false` where the reference gives `nil` survives into places a `nil` would not.
