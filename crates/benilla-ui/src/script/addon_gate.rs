//! **The one load law — `AddOn_CanLoad 0x51e780`, as a pure function** (decision 1292).
//!
//! Every question of the form "can this addon load, and if not, why" has exactly one answer in
//! the reference: a single arbiter whose checks run in a fixed order, whose version gate and
//! CVar read re-run on every query, and whose two out-params (`reasonOut`, `depReasonOut`)
//! render through one formatter. benilla had three partial copies of it — the API verbs'
//! `not_loadable`, `LoadAddOn`'s inline checks, and the startup walk's disabled set — and the
//! screens were about to become a fourth. This module is the one copy they all consult.
//!
//! The check order, byte-verified (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/addon-version-gate.md` §2, a §5
//! pair + arbitration): **missing → visiting-guard (returns loadable — a cycle resolves
//! optimistically) → enabled → banned → corrupt → the version gate → required-deps recursion →
//! demand gate**. The first check that fires decides.
//!
//! ## The version gate (§2.1, byte for byte)
//!
//! `cmp [rec+0x1c], 11200` — an **exact `==` against a hard-coded immediate** (`0x51d7d0` is
//! `mov eax,0x2bc0; ret`, one caller image-wide). `## Interface: 11201` is as out of date as
//! `10000`, and a manifest with **no** `## Interface` line compares as `0` — out of date, not
//! "unknown". On mismatch the reason `7` is written and then, when the check is OFF
//! (`checkAddonVersion`, the *Load out of date AddOns* checkbox inverted), **actively reset to
//! `0`** — an out-of-date addon under force-load is byte-indistinguishable from an up-to-date
//! one; there is no "loadable but flagged" state. Force-load is a fall-through, not a success:
//! the dependency and demand checks still run.
//!
//! ## The reason rendering (§2.3)
//!
//! `reason != 0` → its token; `reason == 0 && depReason != 0` → `DEP_<token>`, applied
//! **exactly once at any nesting depth** (the recursion passes the caller's `depReasonOut` as
//! the callee's *both* out-params, so the deepest failure's raw token lands in the parent's dep
//! slot); both zero → nil (all three callers guard it — `LOADABLE` is unreachable as a reason).
//! `BANNED`/`CORRUPT`/`INSECURE` gate on the server's `SMSG_ADDON_INFO` signature state, which
//! benilla does not model (nothing a player installs is Blizzard-signed) — the arms exist in
//! the table for honesty and are never produced.
