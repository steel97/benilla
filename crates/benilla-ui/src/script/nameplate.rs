//! **The nameplate widgets** — `CGNamePlateFrame` as the frame-system object it actually is
//! (decision 2148; wow-re `system/ui/scratch/nameplate-lua-surface.md`, §5 eight-worker round +
//! orchestrator byte arbitration 2026-09-09, benilla dispatch).
//!
//! benilla drew V-plates for a year as quads pushed straight into the UI pass, which made them
//! invisible to Lua: a live run's `WorldFrame:GetChildren()` returned the two named FrameXML
//! frames and nothing else, and every 1.12 nameplate addon — all of which find plates by walking
//! exactly that list — found nothing to work with. The reference does the opposite, and this
//! module is that difference closed.
//!
//! ## What the reference builds, byte for byte
//!
//! The plate is a `CSimpleButton` subclass (ctor `0x7cb250`, `…\Ui\NamePlateFrame.cpp`, vtable
//! `0x81de50`, size `0x518`) whose **base constructor parents it to the `CGWorldFrame` singleton**
//! `ds:0xb4b2bc` (`0x7786a3` → `0x769318` → `SetParent 0x76ab10`, tail-appending at `0x76abdb`) —
//! so it is a real member of `[worldframe+0x300]`, returned by `GetChildren` and counted by
//! `GetNumChildren`, inheriting strata **0 (WORLD)** and taking level **1**.
//!
//! - **Identity:** `GetObjectType()` = `"Button"`, `IsObjectType` accepts Button/Frame/Region, and
//!   `GetName()` is **nil** — `[this+0x98]` is zeroed at `0x76c50b` and only XML `name=` ever
//!   writes it. Anonymity is load-bearing: `_Nameplates` and pfUI both reject a *named*
//!   `WorldFrame` child.
//! - **Six regions, in creation order**: Border `0x7cb2c2`, Glow `0x7cb361`, Name `0x7cb3d7`,
//!   Level `0x7cb479`, Skull `0x7cb512`, RaidIcon `0x7cb5b4`.
//! - **One child**, the health bar (`GetObjectType()` = `"StatusBar"`), whose own single region is
//!   the BarFill texture `GetStatusBarTexture()` returns. **No cast bar exists in 1.12** — a second
//!   child would be blanked by pfUI, which destructures `healthbar, castbar`.
//! - **Real anchors.** The ctor writes them through `0x767c70` — the *same* primitive and the same
//!   `[layoutObj + 4 + 4·point]` storage the Lua `SetPoint` binding ends in — so `GetPoint`,
//!   `GetLeft` and `GetWidth` answer truthfully. Name = `("BOTTOM", plate, "CENTER", 0, 0)`
//!   (`0x7cb456`), Level = `("CENTER", plate, "BOTTOMRIGHT", …)` (`0x7cb7f5`); `_Nameplates`
//!   *validates* both pairs and rejects a plate that fails them.
//! - **Levels, and this is the surprise:** the bar is put **below** the plate, not above it —
//!   `0x7cb32e mov edx,[plate+0xc4]` (=1) · `0x7cb33c dec edx` · `0x7cb33e call 0x76a4f0(bar,0,0)`,
//!   an absolute level that overrides what `SetParent` had just given it. Plate level 1, **bar
//!   level 0**. Since the draw walk's layer loop is *outer* and its frame walk *inner* (`0x765920`:
//!   layer counter `0x76593c`, frame walk `0x7659d0`–`0x7659f8`, `cmp eax,5` at `0x765a63`), the
//!   whole bar frame drains before any plate layer — which is why the border's bevels cap the
//!   fill's ends. The director pinned that look off a reference crop while `nameplate-vkey.md` §7
//!   recorded the opposite order; the §5 round settled it in the director's favour and corrected
//!   the note.
//! - **Layers** (`GetDrawLayer 0x79a6c0`, table `0x811a80`): Border ARTWORK, Glow **HIGHLIGHT**,
//!   Name/Level/Skull OVERLAY (the ctor re-layers Name and Level off ARTWORK at `0x7cb438`/
//!   `0x7cb4ea`), RaidIcon ARTWORK, BarFill ARTWORK on the bar. **No sub-level exists in 5875**;
//!   within a layer it is creation order.
//! - **Scripts:** the engine installs none, and every C++ override tails into the base
//!   unconditionally, so an addon's `SetScript` on OnShow/OnHide/OnUpdate/OnEnter/OnLeave/
//!   OnMouseDown/OnMouseUp/OnClick fires. `RegisterForClicks(0x500)` = Left/Right on mouse-**up**.
//! - **Pooling:** destroy (`0x608a10`) never unparents — it hides and pushes onto a free list, and
//!   reuse re-runs neither the ctor nor `SetParent`. So **the child-list index is stable for the
//!   session**, and a retired plate is still returned *and counted* (the list walk has no
//!   visibility filter). Every corpus addon's `registry[plate]` identity map rests on that.
//!
//! ## The consumer contract this has to keep
//!
//! Four independent 1.12 addons (`_Nameplates`, `CustomNameplates`, pfUI's vanilla branch,
//! ShaguTweaks' vanilla branch — all `## Interface: 11200`) destructure the two tuples
//! *positionally* and identify a plate by `regions[1]:GetTexture()` being exactly
//! `Interface\Tooltips\Nameplate-Border`. The byte-derived order and the corpus's agree element for
//! element — an independent empirical control on a byte derivation. So the composition is not ours
//! to choose; it is an ABI, and the tests transcribe each addon's own walk.
//!
//! **An addon takes the plate over**, which is the half a painter never had to respect: pfUI blanks
//! all six regions and paints its own, sets `SetAlpha(.95)` on non-targets itself, and ShaguTweaks
//! reparents the raid icon. So [`Plate::create`] writes the static properties (paths, fonts,
//! layers) exactly **once**, [`Plate::lay_out`] rewrites the window-derived anchors only when the
//! window moves, and [`Plate::drive`] writes only what actually changed this frame. The one
//! deliberate exception is the plate's own anchor, which the reference itself re-issues every dirty
//! frame from the seat `0x509ec0` (`ClearAllPoints` + `SetPoint`), wiping an addon anchor *on the
//! plate* there too — which is why every corpus addon anchors its overlay **to** the plate and
//! re-anchors the **bar**, never the plate.
