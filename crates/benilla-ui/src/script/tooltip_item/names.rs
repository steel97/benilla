//! The item tooltip's display vocabulary — the builder's own **key** tables (`INVTYPE_*`,
//! `ITEM_MOD_*`, `SPELL_SCHOOL%d_CAP`), the DBC-sourced subclass/class/race names, and the
//! byte-verified color constants the render law paints with. Pure data; the law itself is
//! [`super::render`], which resolves every key here against the player's own `GlobalStrings.lua`
//! (decision 2045).
//!
//! **Keys, not sentences, and the difference is not cosmetic.** `INVTYPE_SHIELD` and
//! `INVTYPE_WEAPONOFFHAND` both read "Off Hand" in enUS and are separately localizable
//! everywhere else; a table that stored the English could not tell them apart, and this one had
//! them collapsed into a single arm until 2045's sweep.
//!
//! **What stays a Rust literal here, and why it is not the same thing**: [`CLASS_NAMES`] and
//! [`RACE_NAMES`] name rows the reference reads out of DBC records (ChrClasses, ChrRaces), never
//! out of `GlobalStrings.lua`. Those belong to the DBC-feed question, not to this one — and the
//! subclass names that used to sit beside them have gone the whole way there: the type cell and
//! the bag line both read `ItemSubClass.dbc`'s own DisplayName off the app-resolved view now,
//! rather than a hand-typed copy of it.
