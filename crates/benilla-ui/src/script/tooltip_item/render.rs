//!
//! **Every sentence here is a key, never a Rust string** (decision 2045). The builder names its
//! keys outright — the census of the string pointers reachable from `[0x52b650, 0x52e600)` is

//! `LOCKED_WITH_SPELL` and `LOCKED_WITH_SPELL_KNOWN` are all "Requires %s" in enUS and four
//! different strings anywhere else.
//!
//! A key the player's `GlobalStrings.lua` does not carry emits **no line at all** — never an
//! invented one. That is `duration_text`'s disposition and the reference's own: its
