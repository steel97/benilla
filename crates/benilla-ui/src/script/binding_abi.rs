//! The **registered-binding argument/error ABI** — the marshalling contract every one of build
//! 5875's ~700 registered Lua C-bindings opens with, in one place because getting it wrong is
//! wrong 700 times (wow-re `ui/scratch/binding-arg-error-contract.md`, §5-cross-checked with
//! orchestrator byte-arbitration).
//!
//! ## The three helpers the reference uses, and what they accept
//!
//! | addr | contract |
//! |---|---|
//! | `0x6f34d0` | `is-number(L, idx)` — tag 3, **or** a string coerced through `0x6f7c20` |
//! | `0x6f3510` | `is-number-**or**-string(L, idx)` — strictly wider: tag 3 or tag 4 |
//! | `0x6f3620` → `0x40a2b0` | `tonumber` then `double → int32`, **truncating toward zero** |
//!
//! `0x40a2b0` sets the x87 rounding control to chop (`or ah,0xc`) before `fistp`, so it is a C
//! cast and **not** `floor`: `−2.9 → −2`. [`number_arg`] reproduces that (Rust's `as` on a float
//! truncates toward zero as well), and hands back the low dword the bindings actually consume.
//!
//! ## The headline: the `Usage:` arm RAISES
//!
//! `0x6f4940` is `luaL_error`, and it **does not return**: `luaL_where` + `lua_pushvfstring` +
//! `lua_concat` + `lua_error`, whose own chain (`0x6f4440` → `0x6fc780` → `0x6f5d80`) ends in a
//! CRT `longjmp` or `exit(1)` on both legs. The `xor eax,eax; ret` that MSVC emits after every
//! such call inside a binding is **unreachable boilerplate**, not a "returns zero values" arm — a
//! reading five committed wow-re notes had inverted, corrected at the bytes on 2026-08-11.
//!
//! So a binding's bad-argument path **abandons the caller's statement** and unwinds to the
//! enclosing protected call. It returns neither `nil` nor zero values, and a client that answers
//! `nil` there keeps executing a statement the real client never finishes.
//!
//! Stated as the negative, because it is as load-bearing as the positive: the **zero Lua values**
//! outcome is real only where a binding reaches `xor eax,eax; ret` *without* passing through
//! `0x6f4940` — `GetDefaultLanguage`'s four object/bounds failure edges are this repo's one
//! example ([`super::session`]). Those arms genuinely return nothing.
//!
//! ## The three shapes an "empty answer" can take
//!
//! Settled per binding, never generalised:
//!
//! 1. **push nil**, one Lua value (`UnitAffectingCombat` on a false/unresolved unit,
//!    `GetActionText` on a non-macro slot, `UnitInRaid` on a miss).
//! 2. **zero Lua values** — distinct from `nil` for anything that counts the return list (5.0's
//!    `arg.n`, or [`crate::script::UiScript::arity`] on the host side) and for a multiple
//!    assignment, identical to it for a single-value caller (`GetDefaultLanguage`'s failure edges).
//! 3. **raise** — the statement is abandoned.

/// one value at every live `ret`.
///
/// **Not a whole-image absolute, and 2048 corrects 2043 for saying so.** `lua_pushboolean` is real
/// and one of its seven callers *is* a registered FrameScript binding: `IsPetAttackActive
/// 0x4be0e0` answers a genuine Lua `true`/`false` and **never nil** (ours matches — see
/// [`super::pet`]). The other six are `rawequal`/`pcall`/`xpcall` in the base table `0x811e28` and
