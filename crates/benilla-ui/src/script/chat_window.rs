//! The chat **window** surface: `GetChatWindowInfo` (the engine's per-window settings getter) and
//! `ChatFrame_OpenChat` (the FrameXML verb that opens the edit box prefilled).
//!
//! The windows themselves are frames, declared in the app's shipped `ChatFrame.xml` —
//! `ChatFrame1`..`ChatFrame7`, of which 1 and 2 are docked and 3..7 ship hidden and undocked, the
//! reference's own arrangement. This module is the *settings* half: what an addon learns when it
//! asks about window `i` without touching the frame.
//!
//! ## `GetChatWindowInfo(id)` → `name, fontSize, r, g, b, a, shown, locked, docked`
//!
//! A registered Lua binding in the real client (`0x4a0ba0`, wow-re `system/ui/ledger.tsv`), reading
//! the per-window struct array at `0xb4fe50` — stride 0x98, **10 windows**, colour bytes at
//! +0xd8..+0xdb renormalised by the f32 1/255 (`system/ui/scratch/chat-color-table.md`). Those
//! structs are loaded from the character's `chat-cache.txt`, and a real stock one is on disk
//! (`wow-5875-re/WoW/WTF/Account/ONE/VMaNGOS/Onepaladin/chat-cache.txt`) — every value below is
//! quoted from it:
//!
//! ```text
//! WINDOW 1   SIZE 0  COLOR 0 0 0 0  LOCKED 1  DOCKED 1  SHOWN 1
//! WINDOW 2   SIZE 0  COLOR 0 0 0 0  LOCKED 1  DOCKED 2  SHOWN 0
//! WINDOW 3…10 SIZE 0 COLOR 0 0 0 0  LOCKED 1  DOCKED 0  SHOWN 0
//! ```
//!
//! **Three traps live in that tuple, and all three are load-bearing:**
//!
//! 1. **`name` is the empty string, not "General".** Nothing writes a window name until the user
//!    renames a tab, so a stock client answers `""` for every window including the first two. The
//!    familiar labels are a *FrameXML fallback*, not data: `FCF_SetWindowName` (FloatingChatFrame.lua
//!    l.680-684) reads `if ( not name or name == "" )` and substitutes `GENERAL` / `COMBAT_LOG` /
//!    `format(CHAT_NAME_TEMPLATE, id)`. Our own tab labels are that fallback, hardcoded. An addon
//!    proves the contract from the other side: `Enchantrix/EnxConfig.lua:113` does
//!    `local name = GetChatWindowInfo(i); if ( name == "" ) then if (i == 1) then name =
//!    _ENCH('TextGeneral') …` — it would not have been written if the getter answered "General".
//!    Answering "General" here would look friendlier and would be a divergence.
//! 2. **`shown`/`locked`/`docked` are numbers or `nil` — never `0`.** FrameXML branches on them
//!    bare (`if ( shown ) then chatFrame:Show()`, `if ( docked ) then FCF_DockFrame(…)` —
//!    FloatingChatFrame.lua l.59/69), and `0` is TRUE in Lua. A getter that returned the cache's
//!    literal `0` would show every hidden window.
//! 3. **`docked` is a dock POSITION, not a flag.** Window 1 answers `1`, window 2 answers `2` —
//!    the order tabs sit in the dock, which is why `FCF_DockFrame(frame, docked)` takes it as an
//!    index. Reading it as a boolean happens to work; reading it as "is docked" and writing back
//!    `1` would silently reorder the dock.
//!
//! `fontSize` is the cache's `SIZE`, and `0` is what a stock client stores — "use the font's own
//! height". No FrameXML path applies it (`FloatingChatFrame_Update` destructures it and never
//! reads it; the options dropdown checks `FCF_GetCurrentChatFrame():GetFont()` instead), and no
//! corpus addon reads it.
//!
//! ## The three setters, and why this getter stopped being a constant (decision 1589)
//!
//! Until 1589 the whole tuple above was a frozen table: benilla had no way to *change* a window's
//! look, so answering with the stock cache row was the honest answer. B246 ("no chat options at
//! all — background transparency has no home") is the report that ends that, and the reference's
//! own home for it is the chat tab's right-click menu → **Background**, a colour swatch with an
//! opacity slider. So three of the nine values are now real state, written by the reference's own
//! three setters and read straight back out of this getter:
//!
//! | binding | address | what it stores |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `SetChatWindowColor(id, r, g, b)` | `0x4a14f0` | `__ftol(x · 255.0)` per channel |
//! | `SetChatWindowAlpha(id, a)` | `0x4a15d0` | `__ftol(a · 255.0)` |
//! | `SetChatWindowSize(id, size)` | `0x4a1470` | the cache's `SIZE` |
//! | `SetChatWindowLocked(id, isLocked)` | `0x4a1650` | the cache's `LOCKED` |
//!
//! (wow-re `system/ui/ledger.tsv:9449-9451` + `scratch/item17-frameapi-fullcarve.md` l.17-18,
//! VERIFIED; `[0x806498]` is the 255.0 the first two multiply by.) **Bytes, not floats** — that is
//! why the getter renormalises by 1/255, and why [`ChatWindowLook`] stores the colour as `u8`: a
//! set→get round trip through the real client quantises, and a store of `f32` here would
//! round-trip values the reference cannot hold. `SetChatWindowAlpha(1, 0.4)` answers
//! `102/255 = 0.4`, not `0.4`.
//!
//! **The record's own layout**, from the §5 dispatched for this work
//! (`system/ui/scratch/chat-window-record.md`): the colour is ONE packed `CImVector` at
//! **`+0x88` B, `+0x89` G, `+0x8a` R, `+0x8b` A** — note the **BGRA** order — and the font size is
//! an `i32` at **`+0x84`**, not a byte and with no `× 255` anywhere near it. (Both correct this
//! module's earlier `+0xd8..+0xdb`, which was the low half of the *absolute* operand
//! `[esi + 0xb4fed8]`: `0xb4fed8 − 0xb4fe50 = 0x88`.) `chat-cache.txt`'s `COLOR` line is written
//! **R G B A** from `+0x8a,+0x89,+0x88,+0x8b` and parsed straight back as bytes, so the file
//! round-trip is bit-exact and the `×255` / `×1/255` pair exists only at the Lua boundary.
//!
//! Two behaviours of the reference's setters that are easy to miss and are transcribed here:
//!
//! - **`SetChatWindowSize` silently drops a size `<= 0`** (`0x4a14bc jle`). A stock cache holds
//!   `SIZE 0`, so "no size stored" and "cannot store 0" coexist: the field is only ever written by
//!   a real pick off the Font Size menu.
//! - **Nothing clamps.** `__ftol` (`0x40a2b0`) truncates, and the setters store the low byte of
//!   the result with no bound: on a real client `SetChatWindowAlpha(1, 2.0)` stores **254**,
//!   `(1, -1.0)` stores **1**, and `0.5` stores **127**, not 128.
//!
//! **We clamp where it wraps, and that is the one deliberate divergence.** Nothing in FrameXML or
//! the corpus can reach the out-of-domain case (the colour picker's channels and its opacity
//! slider are all `0..1`), and the camera pose file already set this posture: a value nothing can
//! produce is not a thing to be faithful to. The truncation itself IS kept — `0.5` stores 127 here
//! too.
//!
//! **`locked` joined them the day the windows could move.** `SetChatWindowLocked(id, isLocked)` is
//! the fourth setter here now: the chat tab's *Lock/Unlock Window* row is what turns the resize
//! grips and the tab drag on, so a value that used to be a constant has a player-reachable writer
//! and belongs in the record with the rest. The other five stay constants, and that is the honest
//! tree rather than an omission: benilla has no rename, no undock and no window create/close, so
//! `name`, `shown` and `docked` still have nothing that could move them (0288 §2).
//!
//! Measured demand: **3 of the 5 corpus addons that iterate `NUM_CHAT_WINDOWS` call this on the
//! very next line** — `EnhTooltip/Tooltip.lua:1302`, `MikScrollingBattleText.lua:1951` and
//! `Enchantrix/EnxConfig.lua:110`. The first two are the same idiom (look for a window the user
//! named "debug"/"ettdebug"); the third builds a name→index map for its `/enx print-in` config.
//! Without this getter, declaring `NUM_CHAT_WINDOWS` hands those three a loop that raises on its
//! first iteration, so the constant and the getter are one change, not two.
//!
//! ## `ChatFrame_OpenChat(text, chatFrame)`
//!
//! FrameXML in the reference (ChatFrame.lua l.1545), and the same seam as its neighbour
//! `ChatFrame_SendTell` ([`super::party`]): benilla's chat edit machine is app-side
//! (`benilla_app::ui_chat::edit`), so the verb queues the request and the app opens the box.
