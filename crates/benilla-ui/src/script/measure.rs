//! **The synchronous text measure** — the host's font engine, installed *into* the VM so a
//! `GetStringWidth` answers during the Lua call that asked, not a frame later.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The real client's `GetStringWidth 0x79e510` calls straight through to its font engine
//! (`0x772890`) and returns. Ours could not: measuring needs the baked glyph atlas, the atlas
//! lives in the app, and the app only meets the VM at the frame boundary — so the metric was
//! served from the [`MeasureRequest`](super::MeasureRequest) round-trip, which lands at **extract,
//! one frame after the tick that set the text**. Every same-tick `SetText` → `GetStringWidth` pair
//! read **0**.
//!
//! That is not a rounding difference, it is the difference between a laid-out UI and a broken one,
//! and it is the shape the corpus actually writes:
//!
//! ```lua
//! button:SetText(player)                      -- Bagnon_Forever/database/ui.lua:58
//! if button:GetTextWidth() + 40 > width then   -- …:59, same tick
//! ```
//!
//! With the answer 0, that dropdown sized itself to 40px and seven character names drew outside
//! their own frame. The reference's own `SmallMoneyFrame` does the same thing (`MoneyFrame.lua`
//! l.202), which is why [`UiScript::set_digit_advances`](super::UiScript::set_digit_advances)
//! existed: a digits-only stand-in for exactly this, built because the general answer was missing.
//! This is the general answer, and it retires that special case.
//!
//! ## The seam
//!
//! [`TextMeasure`] is one method over the request type the round-trip already speaks, so the host
//! answers a same-tick measure and a batch measure with the same code — there is no second
//! measuring path to drift. The host owns the engine; the engine owns the *when*.
//!
//! **Absent by default, and that is a supported state.** A VM with no measurer installed (every
//! engine test, every headless run without a font atlas) behaves exactly as it did: metrics stay
//! 0 until the round-trip fills them. Nothing here is load-bearing for correctness of the
//! round-trip; it only removes the latency.
