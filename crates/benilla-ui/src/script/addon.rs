//! **The AddOn API** (1188 phase 2) — the eleven globals an addon manager and a demand-loader use,
//! over a registry the host fills at discovery.
//!
//! Every name here is in the 1.12.1 client's own `_G` with origin `engine`
//! (`reference/1.12-globals.tsv`), so all eleven are ours to implement in Rust and the set is
//! measured rather than remembered. `SaveAddOns`/`ResetAddOns`/`GetAddOnEnableState` are
//! deliberately **not** here: they exist only in the *glue* namespace (`Interface\GlueXML\
//! AddonList.lua`), which is a different `_G` from the in-world one this VM is.
//!
//! ## The shapes are the reference's, read off its own call sites
//!
//! Not from memory — from `Interface\GlueXML\AddonList.lua` and `FrameXML\UIParent.lua` in the
//! 1.12 MPQs:
//!
//! ```lua
//! name, title, notes, url, loadable, reason, security, newVersion = GetAddOnInfo(index)
//! local loaded, reason = LoadAddOn(name)          -- UIParent.lua's UIParentLoadAddOn
//! ```
//!
//! `reason` is a **token**, spliced by the reference into `getglobal("ADDON_"..reason)` — so its
//! spelling is load-bearing and its full set is enumerable from `GlobalStrings.lua`: `MISSING`,
//! `DISABLED`, `CORRUPT`, `BANNED`, `INSECURE`, `INTERFACE_VERSION`, `NOT_DEMAND_LOADED`, the
//! `DEP_*` mirrors of each, and `UNKNOWN_ERROR`. `security` is likewise a token, matched against
//! `"SECURE"`/`"INSECURE"`/`"BANNED"` by the glue's icon picker.
//!
//! **Index or name, everywhere.** Every verb takes either, 1-based, because the reference's do.
//!
//! ## The load law lives next door
//!
//! Every "can this load, and why not" answer comes from [`super::addon_gate`] — the reference's
//! `AddOn_CanLoad 0x51e780` as one pure function (decision 1292). The RE answer 1191 §6 was
//! missing has landed (wow-re `addon-version-gate.md`, §5-verified): the version gate is an
//! exact `== 11200` whose refusal the `checkAddonVersion` CVar suppresses by **actively
//! resetting** the reason — so `INTERFACE_VERSION` is now enforced here exactly as the client
//! enforces it, with the *Load out of date AddOns* toggle as the player's escape, instead of
//! 1191's report-but-never-act interim. The CVar is read live per query (§2.2), which is why a
//! checkbox click needs nothing but a list repaint.

    // We stamped it *after* the recursion instead, which is why `LoadAddOn` on two mutually

    // is here and not at the top of the function.
