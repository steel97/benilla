//! The pet bar's drag (decision 1010; wow-re `ui/scratch/pet-action-bar-api.md` §10.3/§10.4/§10.7)
//! — **one** Lua verb, `PickupPetAction`, which forks on whether the cursor is already carrying a
//! pet payload. The reference's own bar calls it from all three gestures (`PetActionButton_OnClick`
//! under shift, `OnDragStart`, and `OnReceiveDrag` — `PetActionBarFrame.lua:252-283`), so "pick up"
//! and "drop" are the same binding seen from either side of an empty cursor.
//!
//! **Three things set this surface apart from [`super::bar`]'s**, and each is why this is its own
//! module rather than an arm of that one:
//!
//! - **The payload is a WORD, forwarded verbatim.** `0x4bce00` hands the cursor's dword straight to
//!   the assign core without reading a field of it, and the core's only write is
//!   `bar[target] = *source`. There is no drop-time encoding — see [`CursorPetAction`].
//! - **The bar's contents are the SERVER's.** Nothing but a pet slot can produce this payload and
//!   nothing but a pet slot accepts it, so the drag can only ever *rearrange* ten words the last
//!   `SMSG_PET_SPELLS` delivered. That is the opposite of the action bar, where the 120-slot table
//!   is ours and a drag populates it.
//! - **A displaced occupant is RELOCATED inside the bar before it is handed back.** The action bar
//!   hops the displaced action onto the cursor unconditionally; here the core first tries to keep
//!   it on the bar (a duplicate's slot, or an empty non-token slot), and only a target that was
//!   *not* a token hands its occupant to the cursor.
//!
//! **A drop always empties the cursor first** (`0x495190 ClearCursor(1,1)`, run by all three of
//! `0x4bce00`'s callers *before* the accept decision), and only a write that relocated nothing
//! re-fills it, with the displaced occupant (`0x4bce38 test eax,eax; je`). So every refusal loses
//! the payload — read at the bytes, all six of `0x4bc9a0`'s exits: the no-op on an equal dword
//! (`0x4bc9ed xor eax,eax`), the passive-source reject (`0x4bca28`), the token abort, and both
//! never-blocking front gates all return `EAX = 0`. 1010 shipped the inverse of this as a named
//! divergence — a refused drop kept its payload — and the director retired it (1016): the case it
//! was protecting against is a drop the reference simply does not make, and dropping a pet spell
//! *away* from the bar is how you take it off the bar in the first place.
//!
//! (The **clamp** on slot 11 is still ours, and still deliberate — see [`PET_SLOTS`].)
