//! The **inspect** surface (decision 0631) — the intent queues behind the ref's
//! `NotifyInspect`/`ClearInspectPlayer`, and the foreign-unit equipment view the unit-keyed
//! `GetInventoryItem*` family reads through.
//!
//! ## Why there is so little here
//!
//! Inspect is the thinnest of the item windows because **the data is already local**. A player's
//! worn gear rides `PLAYER_VISIBLE_ITEM_<n>_0`, which is `UF_FLAG_PUBLIC` — the server streams it
//! to every observer, and benilla already decodes it to render other players' equipment
//! (`benilla::entities::equipment`). So the inspect window paints from a descriptor we hold, not
//! from a reply we wait for; `SMSG_INSPECT` echoes the guid and nothing else, and no reference
//! handler registers an inspect event. `InspectFrame_Show` calls `NotifyInspect(unit)` and
//! `ShowUIPanel` in the same breath, and `InspectPaperDollFrame_OnShow` reads all 19 slots
//! immediately (`Blizzard_InspectUI.lua:6-13`, `InspectPaperDollFrame.lua:57-79`).
//!
//! ## The seam
//!
//! - **Intents:** `NotifyInspect(unit)` queues the token (the app resolves it → player guid →
//!   `CMSG_INSPECT`, which server-side also sets our selection); `ClearInspectPlayer()` flags the
//!   drop, the ref's own `InspectFrame_OnHide` call.
//! - **Push:** the app pushes an [`InspectView`] each frame the inspected unit's resolved slot
//!   views change ([`UiScript::set_inspect`]), or `None` when nothing is being inspected.
//! - **Read:** *no new item getters.* The reference's own `GetInventoryItemTexture(unit, slot)`
//!   family is already unit-keyed; `super::char_stats::player_inv_slot` routes `"player"` to the
//!   self feed and the inspected token here.
//! - **Range:** the two verified d² predicates, `CanInspect` and `CheckInteractDistance`, over one
//!   app-fed per-token distance map ([`UiScript::set_unit_reach`]) — the VM holds no positions. The
//!   map itself is unit-general (every held unit, creature included) and is fed by
//!   `benilla::ui_unit`; only `CanInspect`'s players-only leg is inspect's, and it rides in the
//!   entry.
//!
//! The view is keyed by **unit token**, not guid — the ref stores `InspectFrame.unit` as a token
//! and re-reads it on `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED`, so an inspect window follows a re-target exactly as
//! the real one does. The `guid` rides along only so the app can tell "same token, different
//! player" apart when it rebuilds.
