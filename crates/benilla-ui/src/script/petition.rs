//! The guild-charter **Era API surface** — the guild registrar and the petition window
//! (decision 1672, **re-derived against the byte law in 1678**).
//!
//! [`super::guild`] is *being* in a guild; this is *founding* one, which 1257 §2 deliberately left
//! out and named as the next slice. Fifteen registered globals across two windows (the three tabard
//! ones are the adjacent family and are not built), and the same shape as every other domain here:
//! the app pushes a [`PetitionState`] snapshot ([`UiScript::set_petition`]) and the getters read
//! that plain data; every verb queues a [`PetitionRequest`] the app drains
//! ([`UiScript::take_petition_requests`]). No ECS or net reach from the engine (decision 0068 §3).
//!
//! Every contract below is **VERIFIED at the bytes** — wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/petition-charter-api.md`, a §5 round commissioned by this slice, which carved
//! the whole `PetitionInfo.cpp` TU (`0x84cfb8`). Where it corrected what this file first shipped,
//! the correction is named on the binding.
//!
//! **The snapshot mirrors the module's own `.data` state, and that is why it looks split.** The
//! real client keeps the signature list (`[0xbdce20]` + the `0x10`-stride signer array) and the
//! cached `CGPetition` record (`[0xbdce28]`) as two independent things, because the bindings read
//! them independently: `GetNumPetitionNames`/`GetPetitionNameInfo` answer off the *packet's* list
//! while `GetPetitionInfo` answers off the *record*, and either can exist without the other. So
//! [`PetitionState`] carries them separately rather than as one "is the window open" struct — a
//! collapsed model cannot express `CanSignPetition`'s no-record leg below, and gets it wrong.
//!
//! **This client has no `lua_pushboolean`.** Every predicate is the number `1` or `nil`
//! (`0x6f3810` / `0x6f37f0`), and a name the `NameCache` has not resolved is **`nil`**, not `""`.
//!
//! **`PETITION_SHOW` is deferred, which is what makes the partial states below unreachable in
//! practice.** The event fires only when no signer name is still resolving *and* the record has
//! arrived (`0x4f419b`-`0x4f41ad`), so the window never paints a blank title or a blank row. The
//! deferral lives app-side in `crate::ui_petition`; the getters here still answer honestly at any
//! moment, because an addon may call them whenever it likes.
