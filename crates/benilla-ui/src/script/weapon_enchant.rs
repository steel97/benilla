//! `GetWeaponEnchantInfo` — the two **temporary weapon enchantment** slots, as virtual buff slots.
//!
//! This is the whole data path behind the reference's `TemporaryEnchantFrame`
//! (`BuffFrame.lua:162-233`): the row polls this verb every frame, shows an icon per enchanted
//! weapon, and counts its expiry down. Eight corpus addons call it as well.
//!
//! # The byte-verified signature (`0x4c9790`, `system/ui/ledger.tsv:1972`)
//!
//! Zero arguments — the function never touches the Lua stack for input; `edi` is the state. **Six**
//! return values on **every** path (`mov eax,0x6` at `0x4c993a`, `0x4c995b` and `0x4c998f`, the
//! three exits), in the order FrameXML destructures them:
//!
//! ```text
//! hasMainHandEnchant, mainHandExpiration, mainHandCharges,
//! hasOffHandEnchant,  offHandExpiration,  offHandCharges
//! ```
//!
//! | value | shape | absent |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `has*Enchant` | the **number 1** (`push 0x3ff00000; push 0x0` — the double 1.0 — through the number-push at `0x6f3810`, `0x4c97fc`/`0x4c98c3`) | **nil** (`0x6f37f0`, the nil-push, three of them at `0x4c9873` / `0x4c9944`) |
//! | `*Expiration` | a number of **MILLISECONDS remaining** (`0x5d9d00(item, 1)` → `fild` → number-push, `0x4c9828`-`0x4c983f`) | **nil** |
//! | `*Charges` | a number (the enchantment triple's third dword) | the number **0**, never nil (`mov DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],0x0; fild`, `0x4c985a`) |
//!
//! Milliseconds, not seconds: `ref-BuffFrame.lua:189`/`:212` divide by 1000 before displaying, and
//! `0x5d9d00` is the same live remaining-time reader `benilla::items::Items::enchant_remaining_ms`
//! mirrors (decision 0920). It is *remaining* time, recomputed per call against a deadline — never
//! an absolute stamp.
//!
//! # Which slots, and which enchantment
//!
//! Main hand is fetched first, from **equipment slot 15** (`push 0xf`, `0x4c97c3`), off hand from
//! **16** (`push 0x10`, `0x4c988b`) — the client's 0-based `EQUIPMENT_SLOT_*` numbering, so the
//! live-API `GetInventorySlotInfo` ids one higher (16 `MainHandSlot`, 17 `SecondaryHandSlot`) are
//! what the frame passes to `GetInventoryItemTexture`.
//!
//! Per weapon the binary reads three consecutive dwords off the item's descriptor —
//! `[D+0x4c]` the enchant **id** (`test eax,eax; je` = the entire has-an-enchant gate, `0x4c97f8`),
//! `[D+0x50]` the **duration**, `[D+0x54]` the **charges** — and the `push 0x1` handed to
//! `0x5d9d00` names the enchantment slot: **1 = TEMP**. The identity is read off the client's own
//! field-metadata table, not inferred: `0x83a3c8` = `"ITEM_FIELD_ENCHANTMENT"`, index `0x10`, size
//! `0x15`, with `0x83a2d4`/`0x83a2e8` fixing `D = O + 0x18` — so the triple is fields 25/26/27,
//! slot 1.
//!
//! **The gate is the raw id and nothing else** — no DBC lookup, no display filter. That is why the
//! app feeds this from [`benilla_protocol`]'s `item_enchant(1)` rather than from the tooltip-shaped
//! [`super::EnchantView`] list, which drops an id the `SpellItemEnchantment` catalog cannot name
//! *and* the whole `Flags & 0x2` print-no-line family (decision 0928) — the totem weapon imbues,
//! i.e. precisely the enchants this row exists to show.
//!
//! # The expiration is NOT the wire field
//!
//! The trap, and the reason this went through wow-re rather than being read off the update fields:
//! `[D+0x50]`, the item's own enchantment **duration** dword, is read *only* as a non-zero presence
//! gate (`0x4c981b test ecx,ecx`) — **its value is never returned**. The number comes from a
//! client-local **absolute deadline** at `item+0x324[slot]`, written only by `0x5d9cc0` out of
//! `SMSG_ITEM_ENCHANT_TIME_UPDATE` as `now_ms + seconds*1000`, and read back as
//! `max(0, deadline − now)` (`0x5d9d00`: `0x5d9d15` clock, `0x5d9d2a sub`). **The wire carries
//! seconds; this API returns milliseconds.** So a host stores a deadline and subtracts on read — it
//! never ticks a countdown. `benilla::items::Items` does exactly that, and
//! `Items::enchant_deadline_ms` is the read that keeps an *elapsed* timer as the number `0` rather
//! than collapsing it to "no timer", which is the distinction `BuffFrame_Enchant_OnUpdate` draws
//! "0 s" from.
//!
//! **Our one named gap.** The reference's nil-expiration branch is `[D+0x50] == 0`; ours is "no
//! deadline was ever parked for this slot". They differ for exactly one state — an enchant whose
//! duration field is set but whose `SMSG_ITEM_ENCHANT_TIME_UPDATE` has not arrived yet, where the
//! reference answers the number `0` and we answer nil. Closing it needs an
//! `item_enchant_duration(slot)` accessor beside `item_enchant`/`item_enchant_charges` in
//! `benilla_protocol` (the triple's middle field, deliberately unexposed there because the tooltip
//! never reads it — decision 0920). The server sends the packet in the same breath as the field, so
//! the window is a frame or two.
