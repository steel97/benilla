//! The character-window stats + equipment seam (decision 0208 §3) — the paper doll's data feed.
//!
//! Same engine-free shape as [`super::unit`]: the app pushes a **combat-stats snapshot** per unit
//! that has one ([`super::UiScript::set_player_combat_stats`] /
//! [`super::UiScript::set_pet_combat_stats`]) and an **inventory-slot snapshot**
//! ([`super::UiScript::set_inventory_slots`]) each frame they change, and the stat/slot globals
//! here read that plain data.
//!
//! **The stat family is unit-parameterised, as the reference's is** (decision 1057): every
//! `PaperDollFrame_Set*(unit, prefix)` helper the character sheet calls with `"player"`, the pet
//! sheet calls with `"pet"` (ref `PetPaperDollFrame.lua:73-81`), through these very bindings. So
//! `UnitStat`/`UnitResistance`/`UnitArmor`/… route on the token — `"player"` and `"pet"` each read
//! their own pushed snapshot, and **every other token (and a snapshot the app has not pushed yet)
//! serves the absent shape**: zeros, `percent` 1.0. That last part *is* faithful — the 1.12 fields
//! behind these (`UNIT_FIELD_STAT*`, `POSSTAT`/`NEGSTAT`, the damage/AP block) are
//! PRIVATE/OWNER_ONLY, so no third unit ever streams them. A pet's descriptor carries the UNIT
//! half and no PLAYER block at all, which is why its buff decompositions read `0` and the ref's
//! own pet sheet shows plain white numbers.
//!
//! (Until 1057 the router was a hard `token == "player"` test documented as "the faithful
//! player-only gate". It was neither: it was "no consumer yet". The reference passes `"pet"` into
//! the same bindings, and the gate was simply never exercised.)
//!
//! Return shapes are the ref Lua's own inverse math (ref-PaperDollFrame): the descriptor carries
//! the *effective* value plus the split positive/negative buff deltas; `base = effective − pos −
//! neg`. The negative deltas arrive **negative-or-zero** (vmangos `Player.h:1505`
//! `ApplyStatBuffMod` routes a debuff's already-negative amount into `NEGSTAT`;
//! `StatSystem.cpp:335-336` writes the AP mods' negative half the same way), matching the ref's
//! `negBuff < 0` tests.
