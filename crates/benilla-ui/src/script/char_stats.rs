//! The character-window stats + equipment seam (decision 0208 §3) — the paper doll's data feed.
//!
//! Same engine-free shape as [`super::unit`]: the app pushes a **combat-stats snapshot** per unit
//! that has one ([`super::UiScript::set_player_combat_stats`] /
//! [`super::UiScript::set_pet_combat_stats`]) and an **inventory-slot snapshot**
//! ([`super::UiScript::set_inventory_slots`]) each frame they change, and the stat/slot globals
//! here read that plain data.
//!
//! **The stat family is unit-parameterised, as the reference's is** (decision 1057): every
//! `PaperDollFrame_Set*(unit, prefix)` helper the character sheet calls with `"player"`, the pet
//! sheet calls with `"pet"` (ref `PetPaperDollFrame.lua:73-81`), through these very bindings. So
//! `UnitStat`/`UnitResistance`/`UnitArmor`/… route on the token — `"player"` and `"pet"` each read
//! their own pushed snapshot, and **every other token (and a snapshot the app has not pushed yet)
//! serves the absent shape**: zeros, `percent` 1.0. A pet's descriptor carries the UNIT half and no
//! PLAYER block at all, which is why its buff decompositions read `0` and the ref's own pet sheet
//! shows plain white numbers.
//!
//! (Until 1057 the router was a hard `token == "player"` test documented as "the faithful
//! player-only gate". It was neither: it was "no consumer yet". The reference passes `"pet"` into
//! the same bindings, and the gate was simply never exercised.)
//!
//! **The absent shape for a third unit is the right ANSWER for `UnitStat` and a known GAP for the
//! resistance pair — and the reason it used to be filed as blanket-faithful was wrong.** The
//! binary does not gate slots 1/2 on SELF at all: `UnitStat`'s are NULL + typemask bit 3 only, and
//! it returns whatever the client's copy of `UNIT_FIELD_STAT0+i` holds (VERIFIED wow-re
//! `ui/scratch/pet-paperdoll-stat-api.md` §4). What makes our zeros agree there is the *server's*
//! visibility, not a client gate: `UNIT_FIELD_STAT*` is PRIVATE + OWNER_ONLY, and the only
//! owner-visible units a 1.12 unit token can name are the two we already serve — so a stranger's
//! copy is zero on the reference too. `UNIT_FIELD_RESISTANCES` carries a third flag,
//! **`SPECIAL_INFO`**, which vmangos grants to the caster of `SPELL_AURA_EMPATHY` — its own comment
//! reads `// Beast Lore` (`Player.cpp:2603-2610`, `Object.cpp:1065-1067`). So with Beast Lore up on
//! a beast, the reference's `UnitResistance("target", i)` / `UnitArmor("target")` return that
//! creature's real numbers through their non-SELF leg, and ours return zeros. That is a real,
//! reachable divergence, unfed rather than decided: the app pushes snapshots for two tokens only.
//! `unit_combat_stats` already works over any store, so the missing piece is a third push.
//!
//! **Return shapes differ BY FAMILY, and the reference Lua's own asymmetry is the tell**
//! (decision 1397 — reading one and assuming the other is how 0208 got the stat row wrong).
//! `UnitStat` serves the **raw** `UNIT_FIELD_STAT` twice — once as-is, once clamped at zero — and
//! leaves the subtraction to `PaperDollFrame_SetStats`, which writes `(stat - posBuff - negBuff)`
//! itself. `UnitResistance`/`UnitArmor` serve a **decomposed** first return, because the engine
//! helper `0x5efcd0` does that subtraction for them; their callers use it directly.
//!
//! The negative deltas are **negative-or-zero** where the wire can carry them at all, matching the
//! ref's `negBuff < 0` tests — but see 1397 for how little of that survives a given server: these
//! four arrays are stored float and narrowed to int by `Object::BuildValuesUpdate`, and that cast
//! saturates a negative to `0` on an arm64 host while wrapping it correctly on x86.
