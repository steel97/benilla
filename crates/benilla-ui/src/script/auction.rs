//! The auction-house bindings (decision 1511) — the Era-shaped auctioneer surface, the same two-way
//! seam as [`super::merchant`]/[`super::mail`]: the app pushes an **auction snapshot** (three lists
//! of rows, already resolved from the wire to name/icon/quality/owner and already in display order)
//! and the Lua `QueryAuctionItems`/`PlaceAuctionBid`/`StartAuction`/… calls queue outbound
//! **intents** the app drains. The engine holds no auction knowledge: a row is a header, the sort
//! is a pushed ordering, and the category tree is a pushed table.
//!
//! ## Three lists, one API
//!
//! Every getter is keyed by a list type string — `"list"` (Browse), `"bidder"` (Bids) and
//! `"owner"` (Auctions) — and `index` is **1-based within the current 50-row batch**, not within
//! the whole result set. `GetNumAuctionItems` returns the pair `numBatchAuctions, totalAuctions`;
//! when `total > batch` the window is paging, and the page turners re-query rather than scroll.
//!
//! ## The two null shapes that are load-bearing
//!
//! `GetAuctionSellItemInfo()` **always returns six values, never zero** — an empty sell slot pushes
//! `nil, nil, 1, -1, nil, 0`, with a hard `count = 1` and `quality = -1` rather than nils. The
//! reference Lua reads that count unguarded (`if count > 1`), so a nil there throws the moment the
//! player pulls the item back out of the slot. `GetAuctionItemInfo` answers a lone `nil` for an
//! out-of-range index, which is the shape its callers test.
//!
//! ## Sorting is ours, and it is not a three-state cycle
//!
//! The wire carries no sort field, so the ordering is entirely client-side over the ≤50 rows the
//! server returned. Each list owns an **8-deep most-recently-clicked key stack** of
//! `(key, reversed)` pairs: clicking the column that is already primary toggles its direction;
//! clicking any other promotes it to primary **keeping the direction it remembers**. That is why
//! `IsAuctionSortReversed` can answer "reversed" for a column that is not currently sorting
//! anything. [`super::UiScript::take_auction_sorts`] hands the click to the app, which owns the
//! stacks and pushes both the reordered rows and the stack back. The selection rides through all
//! of it untouched, because it is stored as an auction **id** and only resolved to a row position
//! when something asks (wow-re §5 TU-5).
//!
//! ## The deposit is computed here, and it is the *client's* arithmetic
//!
//! `CalculateAuctionDeposit(minutes)` reproduces the real client's formula —
//! `floor(rate × stackValue / 100) × floor(minutes / 120)` — including the intermediate truncation
//! that makes it disagree with what the server actually charges on cheap items. Decision 1511 §7
//! records why the label follows the client rather than the server: it is a client artifact, and
//! benilla renders what the director's client renders.
