//! The world-map bindings (decision 0203 phase 2) — the Era-shaped map-navigation surface the
//! reference `WorldMapFrame.lua` reads, over the questgiver/quest-log seam shape: the app pushes
//! a static **catalog** once (continents → zones, from `WorldMapArea`/`AreaTable`/
//! `WorldMapContinent`) and a small per-frame **feed** (the player's resolved zone, projected map
//! position, and facing — all projection math stays app-side in `map_proj`); the engine owns the
//! **selection** (which map is displayed) so `SetMapZoom` → `GetCurrentMapContinent` reads back
//! synchronously in the same click, exactly like the quest-log selection precedent.
//!
//! `SetMapZoom`/`SetMapToCurrentZone`/`ProcessMapClick` queue `WORLD_MAP_UPDATE` through the
//! model's pending-event queue (fired at the next tick — the reference's synchronous fire is a
//! repaint trigger, and one tick is invisible at frame rate).
//!
//! Selection encoding (the Lua-visible one, wow-re-confirmed — the client's internal indices
//! `+1`): continent `0` = the world sheet, `1..` = the catalog's continents; zone `0` = the
//! whole continent, `1..` = that continent's zone list. The catalog's *order* defines those
//! indices everywhere (dropdowns, `SetMapZoom`, the feed) — the app builds it under the
//! verified rules (WorldMapArea file order for continents, case-insensitive display-name sort
//! for zones; wow-re Q1(d)/Q3(b) verdicts, 2026-07-07).
//!
//! …and a **third** selection state beside that pair: the **direct area**, the map of an
//! instance — a battleground, a dungeon — which is no continent's child and so falls out of both
//! lists (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/worldmap-direct-area-selection.md`). The reference does not
//! encode it inside `(continent, zone)`: it carries THREE `.data` cells, and `continent == -2`
//! with a `WorldMapArea` row **ID** in the third one IS that state ([`WorldMapState::direct_area`]).
//! Inside Warsong Gulch a client without it answers `GetMapInfo() == nil`, and the stock
//! `Blizzard_BattlefieldMinimap.lua:83-86` returns on the fourth line of its update — an empty
//! battle map and an empty world map, which is the bug this models away.
//!
//! Continent-level hover/click resolve through the pushed **zone grid** — the 128×128 area
//! bitmap (`Interface\WorldMap\<Continent>.zmp`, remapped app-side to 1-based zone indices; the
//! source + cell law are wow-re-verified, `0x4a6ec0` / the Q1 §5 verdict 2026-07-07). The cell
//! law itself is transcribed here ([`area_grid_cell`]) rather than in the app's `map_proj`
//! because its only callers are these bindings. `UpdateMapHighlight` answers per level exactly
//! as `0x4a7fa0` does (wow-re 15b2a8ea): at continent level the hovered zone's name **and** its
//! highlight quad; at zone level a **name only** — a revealed overlay's sub-area when the cursor
//! is inside its `WorldMapOverlay` hit rect, else the neighbouring zone or city whose grid cell
//! the cursor is in through the displayed zone's rect window, never the displayed zone itself —
//! with a nil fileName, so the frame hides the quad (report B360). The world sheet's continent
//! highlight is not built: hovering a continent there answers the nil/zero tail.
//!
//! Zone maps carry **exploration fog**: the base tiles are the unexplored parchment, and each
//! discovered sub-area's overlay art (`GetNumMapOverlays`/`GetMapOverlayInfo`, filtered by the
//! pushed `PLAYER_EXPLORED_ZONES` bitset) fills it in — the reference's own overlay pool draws
//! the returned pieces. The landmark family (`GetNumMapLandmarks`/`GetMapLandmarkInfo`) answers
//! with the `AreaPOI.dbc` rows the displayed level admits, then the guard-directions marker
//! (decisions 1586, 1514).
