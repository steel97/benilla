//! The container bindings (decision 0068 T2) — the 1.12 bag verbs, every one of them a plain
//! top-level global (decision 1198; measured on the corpus: `GetContainerItemLink`,
//! `GetContainerNumSlots` and `GetContainerItemInfo` are the three most-wanted engine verbs of
//! all, and Bagnon's data engine is built on exactly these). Same two-way seam as
//! [`super::action`]: the app pushes a **container snapshot** per bag id
//! ([`UiScript::set_container`] — slots already resolved to icon/count/quality by the app's
//! item stores; the engine holds no item knowledge), and `UseContainerItem` queues an outbound
//! **intent** the app drains into the wire ([`UiScript::take_container_uses`]).
//!
//! Bag ids are the live API's space: `0` the backpack, `1..4` the equipped bags (bank later).
//! Slots are 1-based. One deliberate divergence from the 1.14 documentation:
//! `containerInfo.iconFileID` carries our icon **texture path** (`Interface\Icons\…`), not a
//! numeric FileDataID — 5875 has no FileDataIDs, and every measured consumer feeds the value
//! straight to `SetTexture`, which takes both shapes in the live client.
