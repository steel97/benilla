//! The loot bindings (decision 0084) — the Era-shaped loot-window surface, the same two-way seam as
//! [`super::merchant`]/[`super::container`]/[`super::gossip`]: the app pushes a **loot snapshot**
//! ([`UiScript::set_loot`] — the rows already resolved from the wire to name/icon/quantity/quality by
//! the app's item stores, with the synthesized coin row first) and the Lua `LootSlot`/`CloseLoot`
//! calls queue outbound **intents** the app drains ([`UiScript::take_loot_picks`] /
//! [`UiScript::take_loot_close`]). The engine holds no loot knowledge — a row is "a name, an icon
//! path, a quantity, a quality, and whether it's the coin pile".
//!
//! ## The Era API shape
//!
//! 1.12's loot API is a flat set of globals the FrameXML `LootFrame.lua` drives (VERIFIED against the
//! extracted `LootFrame.lua`, scratchpad): `GetNumLootItems()`, `GetLootSlotInfo(slot)` →
//! `texture, item, quantity, quality` (`LootFrame.lua:81`), `LootSlotIsItem(slot)` /
//! `LootSlotIsCoin(slot)` (`LootFrame.lua:80`), `GetLootSlotLink(slot)` → the row's item link (what
//! the row click's ctrl/shift arms read, `LootFrame.lua:149`/`:152` — decision 1059),
//! and `CloseLoot()` (fired from `OnHide`, `LootFrame.lua:143-145`). `slot` is **1-based**; an
//! out-of-range slot answers `nil`.
//!
//! ## The take is TWO verbs, not one (decision 1744)
//!
//! `LootSlot(slot)` looks like "loot row n" and is not: in 1.12 it is the **LOOT_BIND confirmation
//! continuation** alone. The C dispatcher `0x4c2790(slot, flag)` takes the row only on `flag == 0`,
//! which no Lua binding reaches — the row click is the C `CLootButton`'s own behaviour — while
//! `LootSlot 0x4c2e70` passes `flag = 1`, whose arm refuses every slot but the one a bind confirm
//! is pending for. benilla has no `CLootButton`, so the click arm is `BenillaTakeLootSlot(slot)`
//! and `LootSlot` keeps the reference's meaning exactly.
//!
//! The **coin pile is a synthesized client-side row** (first in the list when the loot carries gold):
//! `LootSlotIsCoin` is true for it, its `item` text is the formatted money amount, and `LootSlot(1)`
//! on it queues the money intent. The app maps a clicked 1-based row to either the money intent or the
//! wire loot slot the item lives at (`CMSG_AUTOSTORE_LOOT_ITEM` addresses the **wire** slot, which is
//! *not* the 1-based display position once a coin row is prepended or a row is removed) — the Lua side
//! never sees the wire slot, exactly as the merchant's Lua side never sees the item entry.
//!
//! ## Master loot (decision 1675)
//!
//! Two more globals ride the same seam when the group's loot method is master loot:
//! `GetMasterLootCandidate(index)` reads [`LootState::master_candidates`] (names, 1-based, dense)
//! and `GiveMasterLoot(slot, candidateIndex)` queues an assignment the app resolves to a wire slot
//! and a recipient guid. The *decision* to open the dropdown is not Lua's: the app fires
//! `OPEN_MASTER_LOOT_LIST` when a picked row's wire `slot_type` is `MASTER`, which is where the
//! real client puts it too — its take dispatcher branches on the same byte before any Lua runs.
