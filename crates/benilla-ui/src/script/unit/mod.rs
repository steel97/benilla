//! The game-state `Unit*` bindings (decision 0068 §3) — the first slice of the addon-facing API that
//! reads *live game state*, and the seam that keeps this crate engine-free while doing so.
//!
//! The engine must not touch the ECS/net (decisions 0006/0061: the codec is stateless, the ECS owns
//! state). So instead of reaching outward, the app pushes a per-frame **unit snapshot** into the VM
//! via [`UiScript::set_unit`], and the `Unit*` globals here read that plain data. A frame's
//! `UnitHealth("player")` therefore resolves against a [`UnitState`] the Bevy side deposited that
//! frame — the same shape a real addon sees, with none of the coupling.
//!
//! Return shapes follow the live API (warcraft.wiki.gg): `UnitName` returns the name *or nil*;
//! `UnitHealth`/`UnitHealthMax`/`UnitLevel` return numbers (`UnitLevel` returns **−1** for a
//! unit whose level "can't be told" — [`level_reads_unknown`], the target frame's skull gate);
//! a unit that doesn't exist reports `UnitExists` false and the numbers `0` (nil for the name),
//! exactly as the client does for an absent unit token. Tokens (`"player"`, `"target"`, …) are opaque strings the host never
//! interprets — the app decides what each maps to.
//!
//! v1 gaps, stated not hidden: the snapshot carries only the *active* power slot (see the
//! `UnitPower` note below); `UnitIsDead` returns a Lua boolean rather than the client's `1`/nil
//! (truthy either way — the shape a caller branches on is identical); `UnitIsConnected`'s backing
//! field defaults `false`, and no app-side feed sets it `true` for live units yet (decision 0434
//! §2's party-frame predicates land the binding first, the feed follows — see the field doc).
