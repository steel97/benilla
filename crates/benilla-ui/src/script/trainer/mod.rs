//! The trainer bindings (decision 0237) — the Era-shaped class/profession trainer surface driving a
//! faithful port of the real 1.12 `ClassTrainerFrame` (extracted from `interface.MPQ`:
//! `Interface\FrameXML\ClassTrainerFrame.{xml,lua}`). Same two-way seam as [`super::merchant`]: the
//! app pushes a **trainer snapshot** ([`UiScript::set_trainer`] — the wire services already resolved
//! to name/icon/cost/state/requirements by the app), and the Lua `BuyTrainerService`/`CloseTrainer`
//! calls queue outbound **intents** the app drains ([`UiScript::take_trainer_buys`] returns the
//! chosen services' **spell ids** / [`UiScript::take_trainer_close`]). The engine holds no trainer
//! knowledge — a service is name/subtext/icon/cost/state/gates/description, all app-resolved.
//!
//! ## The Era API shape (matched to the real `ClassTrainerFrame.lua`)
//!
//! The reference window's `.lua` is transcribed onto these bindings, so the return *shapes* match it
//! verbatim: `GetTrainerServiceInfo → name, subText, serviceType, isExpanded`;
//! `GetTrainerServiceCost → money, talentPointCost, professionPointCost`;
//! `GetTrainerServiceSkillReq → skill, rank, hasReq`; `GetTrainerServiceAbilityReq → name, hasReq`;
//! `IsTrainerServiceLearnSpell → isLearnSpell, isPetLearnSpell`. `serviceType` is either the string
//! `"header"` (a skill-line group header, with `isExpanded` set) or the service's colour state
//! `"available"`/`"unavailable"`/`"used"` (green/red/gray, `isExpanded` nil).
//!
//! ## The tree (decisions 0247 + 1124 — the byte-verified grouping/sort model, **per trainer type**)
//!
//! The 1.12 wire (`SMSG_TRAINER_LIST`) is a **flat** service list; the client builds a **collapsible
//! tree** on top of it, and `index` is **1-based into that visible tree**, not the wire order.
//! [`UiScript::set_trainer`] takes the flat services (each already carrying its app-resolved
//! [`TrainerService::group_key`]/[`TrainerService::group_name`]) and synthesizes the tree: one
//! **header row per distinct group key**, then that group's services in the group's own order. State
//! is a per-row **colour**, never the grouping key.
//!
//! **The `trainerType` selects everything** — the list finalizer `0x4d8410` picks the row comparator
//! by `ds:0xb73a08` (`dec eax; je` chain @ `0x4d8561`) and the builder `0x4d7560` picks both the
//! group key and the header comparator by the same dword (`0x4d7786`, `0x4d79eb`). Neither the group
//! key nor the sort is one law with a "later refinement" — they are four laws, and 1124 is where
//! benilla stopped applying the class one to all of them:
//!
//! | type | rows | headers | group key |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 0 class, 3 pet | `0x4d85c0` — level → skill value → name → rank | `0x4d7b90`, by name | taught spell's `SkillLine` |
//! | 1 mount ("talent") | `0x4d8850` — **state byte → name** | `0x4d7b90`, `-1` first then by name | `-1` when the service is `used`, else the `SkillLine` |
//! | 2 tradeskill | `0x4d8760` — **skill value → name**, no level key, no rank key | `0x4d7c30`, by **raw key asc** | **1 or 2**, see below |
//!
//! At type 2 the group key is **not a skill line and never resolves one**: the builder defaults it
//! to 2 and sets it to 1 iff the **wire** spell's own `Spell.dbc Effect[0..2]` contains `44`
//! `SKILL_STEP` (`0x4d77b6`), which makes exactly two groups — `TRADESKILL_SERVICE_STEP` ("Development
//! Skills", the profession-learn services) and `TRADESKILL_SERVICE_LEARN` ("Recipes") — and means
//! **no row is ever dropped at a tradeskill trainer**. That partition, not a level key, is what puts
//! "Apprentice Blacksmith" at the top of a blacksmithing trainer: `reqLevel` is inert at type 2.
//! At the other types a service whose group key is `0` (unresolved skill line) is still dropped,
//! matching the client.
//!
//! A service hides when its state fails the dropdown filter ([`Model::trainer_filter`]) or its group
//! is collapsed ([`Model::trainer_collapsed`]) — but **hiding is not removing**: the client parks a
//! hidden record in a tail behind the visible ones and keeps its index, so `GetNumTrainerServices`
//! answers with the *visible* count while every getter's index space is the *whole* array ([`rows`]).
//! An index past the count is a legal hidden row, and the stock window is handed exactly one after a
//! purchase ([`selected_row`]). `Collapse/ExpandTrainerSkillLine(id)` take the **display index of a
//! header row** (`id == 0` = all groups — the collapse-all button); they toggle that group's
//! visibility, never reorder.
//!
//! The **selection** is likewise the selected service's **spell id** (`ds:0xb73a0c`), re-resolved to
//! a position on every `GetTrainerSelectionIndex` — never a stored row number ([`selected_row`]).
//!
//! ## Faithful stubs (no wire data yet — kept so the ported XML runs)
//!
//! `GetTrainerServiceStepReq` returns nil (no tradeskill-step data on the wire), and per-requirement
//! `hasReq`/`met` flags are derived from the service's overall `category` (an unavailable service has
//! an unmet gate) rather than a per-gate wire bit, which 5875 does not send.
//!
//! One thing the client does that this engine does not, named rather than left to be discovered: a
//! group whose row counters go to zero **vanishes entirely, header included** (`0x4d8460`,
//! `0x4d8528`–`0x4d8549`) — which is how a type-1 trainer whose every service is `used` shows one
//! "My Talents" header and no skill-line headers at all. benilla always keeps a header. The case
//! that is *reachable* here (does the state-filter dropdown emptying a group also take its header?)
//! is an open question with wow-re; the build-time case above cannot arise, because benilla builds
//! a group only from services that exist.

/// **five references image-wide** — the finalizer seeding and decrementing it, the buy-ALL loop, and
/// `GetNumTrainerServices` — and **no getter is among them**. So an index past
/// `GetNumTrainerServices()` is a legal, resolvable, *hidden* row — which is exactly the index the
/// stock window is handed after a purchase, and reading it as out-of-range is what used to strand
/// the detail pane ([`selected_row`]). An all-boxes-off window is empty because the Lua stops

/// costs nothing until something walks the tail.

/// **The filter and the collapse are deliberately asymmetric**, and that asymmetry is structural in
