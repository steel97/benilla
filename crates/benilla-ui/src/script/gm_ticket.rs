//! The GM trouble-ticket **Era API surface** (decision 1673) — the seven globals `HelpFrame.lua`
//! is written against, and nothing else.
//!
//! All seven are engine bindings in 1.12 (`reference/1.12-globals.tsv` lists each as
//! `function`/`engine`), and the set is closed: the shipped Help window calls exactly
//! `GetGMTicketCategories`, `GetGMStatus`, `GetGMTicket`, `NewGMTicket`, `UpdateGMTicket`,
//! `DeleteGMTicket` and `Stuck`, and nothing else in the shipped UI calls any of them.
//!
//! **The five ticket verbs share ONE ordered queue** ([`GmTicketIntent`]), rather than a counter
//! each. Call order is the wire order in the real client, and a per-verb drain cannot preserve it:
//! with separate queues, `DeleteGMTicket(); GetGMTicket()` in a single chunk puts the *get* on the
//! wire first and the answer then describes the state before the delete. The shipped Help window
//! never issues two in one frame, so nothing on screen would ever have shown it — which is exactly
//! why it is worth getting right rather than leaving as a latent trap for the next addon, or for
//! our own probe (which hit it).
//!
//! A queue, not a set: **two calls are two sends**. That matters more here than for
//! [`super::binder`], because the ticket toast **re-polls `GetGMTicket()` every 10 minutes** — a
//! deduplicating drain would silently stop the poll. `Stuck()` keeps its own counter, because it
//! is not a ticket verb at all (see its registration below) and shares no ordering with them.
//!
//! **The category list is DBC data, pushed once.** `GetGMTicketCategories()` returns a flat
//! `id1, name1, id2, name2, …` vararg list, which `HelpFrameGM_UpdateCategories(...)` walks with
//! Lua 5.0's `arg`/`arg.n`. The ids are `GMTicketCategory.dbc`'s own and they are the values that
//! go on the wire, so this is an ordered list of pairs rather than an indexable table — see
//! [`benilla_formats::gm_ticket_category`] for why renumbering would misfile every ticket.
//!
//! **There is no `GetGMTicket` *getter*.** The reference's `GetGMTicket()` is a SEND, not a read:
//! the answer comes back as the `UPDATE_TICKET` event's arguments, and the window keeps whatever
//! it needs in its own frame fields. So nothing here holds a ticket snapshot — the same shape as
//! [`super::duel`] and [`super::binder`], and for the same reason.
