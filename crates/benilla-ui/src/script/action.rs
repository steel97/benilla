//! The action-bar bindings (decision 0068 slice 1, extended by decision 0216 §7/slice 4) — both
//! directions of the engine seam in one place: the app pushes an **action snapshot** (what each
//! of the 120 action slots displays, [`UiScript::set_action`], same inward shape as
//! [`super::unit`]'s snapshots), and `UseAction` queues an outbound **intent** the app drains
//! into the wire ([`UiScript::take_action_uses`], same outward shape as [`super::sound`]'s
//! queue). The engine holds no spell/item/macro KNOWLEDGE — a slot is "a texture, a count, and
//! the packed `(kind, action)` halves" — but slice 4 hands it the packed halves themselves so the
//! cursor seam ([`super::cursor::bar`]) can pick a slot up and place it without round-tripping the
//! app: the ENGINE owns the payload + the local slot mutation against its own optimistic mirror
//! of `model.actions`, the APP owns the authoritative 120-table and drains the queued
//! `action_sets` onto the wire (`CMSG_SET_ACTION_BUTTON`).
//!
//! Actions are keyed by the **Lua action id** (1..120, the live API's space; the 1.12 wire's
//! 120-slot array is this minus one). `GetBonusBarOffset` reports the app-pushed stance/form
//! page offset — the vanilla main bar shows actions `(6 + offset − 1)·12 + i` when an offset is
//! active (warrior stances, druid forms), which the FrameXML side computes exactly like
//! Blizzard's own bar code.
