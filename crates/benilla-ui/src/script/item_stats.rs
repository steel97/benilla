//! The **shared item-template store** — one `item id → ItemTemplateView` table every item hover
//! renders through (decision 0274 P1). In the real client every item tooltip is the same C++
//! renderer (`0x52b650`, behind 8 of the 9 `Set*Item` bindings — wow-re
//! `ui/scratch/tooltip-money.md`) over the same item-template cache; benilla mirrors that with
//! one engine store the app feeds from its ask-once `ITEM_QUERY` template cache, and one engine
//! renderer ([`super::tooltip_item`]).
//!
//! Fill flow: the app **pushes** every item template the moment it lands in its cache
//! ([`super::UiScript::set_item_template`]) — arrival-driven, so a first hover of an item whose
//! name is already on screen always hits. A renderer read of an id the app never resolved
//! additionally records the id ([`super::UiScript::take_item_stat_asks`] drains them), which
//! makes the app send `CMSG_ITEM_QUERY` and push when the answer arrives — the real client's
//! uncached-item early-out (cleared tooltip + query; the hover's re-enter loop repaints on
//! arrival).
//!
//! The view carries the template's tooltip-relevant fields plus the strings only the app can
//! resolve (skill/faction names from the DBC catalogs, trigger-spell display text) — the engine
//! renders lines, it never reads DBCs.
