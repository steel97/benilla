//! The tradeskill bindings (decision 0437 phase 2) — the Era-shaped crafting-window surface driving a
//! faithful port of the real 1.12 `TradeSkillFrame` (extracted from `interface.MPQ`:
//! `Interface\FrameXML\Blizzard_TradeSkillUI\TradeSkillFrame.{xml,lua}`). Same two-way seam as
//! [`super::trainer`]: the app pushes a **tradeskill snapshot** ([`UiScript::set_trade_skill`] — the
//! recipes already resolved to name/icon/reagents/tools/color by the app from `Spell.dbc`/
//! `SkillLineAbility.dbc`/bag counts), and the Lua `DoTradeSkill`/`CloseTradeSkill` calls queue
//! outbound **intents** the app drains ([`UiScript::take_trade_skill_dos`] returns
//! `(spell id, count)` pairs / [`UiScript::take_trade_skill_close`]). The engine holds no recipe
//! knowledge — a recipe is name/icon/difficulty/reagents/tools/cooldown, all app-resolved (0437 §"The
//! decision" item 1).
//!
//! ## The Era API shape (matched to the real `TradeSkillFrame.lua`)
//!
//! `GetTradeSkillInfo(index) → name, type, numAvailable, isExpanded`: `type` is either the recipe's
//! difficulty color key (`"optimal"|"medium"|"easy"|"trivial"`, [`TradeSkillDifficulty::as_str`]) or
//! `"header"` for a group row (see below); `isExpanded` is `nil` for a recipe row, `1`/`nil` for a
//! header. `GetTradeSkillReagentInfo`/`GetTradeSkillTools`/`GetTradeSkillCooldown`/
//! `GetTradeSkillNumMade`/`GetTradeskillRepeatCount` (note the lowercase "s" in "Tradeskill" — that
//! IS the real 1.12 spelling) round out the detail pane; `DoTradeSkill` queues the craft,
//! `CloseTradeSkill` is the client-side close (vanilla sends no packet here either, matching
//! [`super::trainer`]'s `CloseTrainer` precedent).
//!
//! ## The grouped list — wow-re `tradeskill` TU-B, VERIFIED
//!
//! Unlike v1's flat render, the engine now owns the WHOLE display tree, built fresh from
//! [`TradeSkillState::recipes`] on every query ([`build_groups`]) — [`TradeSkillState::recipes`] is
//! just the app's flat, unordered input; its push order carries no meaning. Every recipe belongs to
//! a group keyed by the CREATED item's `(ItemClass, ItemSubClass)`, named from `ItemSubClass.dbc`
//! (resolved app-side — [`TradeSkillRecipe::group`]); a recipe whose product template is still in
//! flight has no group yet (the client's own one-frame header deferral) and buckets trailing under
//! a synthesized group keyed `(u32::MAX, u32::MAX)` with an empty name — no real `ItemClass` reaches
//! `u32::MAX`, so it sorts last with no special-casing. Groups order by `ItemClass` id ascending,
//! ties broken alphabetically by group name (case-insensitive, never by subclass id); within a
//! group, recipes order by difficulty tier ascending (Optimal < Medium < Easy < Trivial — the byte
//! tiers 0..3, [`TradeSkillDifficulty::tier`]), ties broken alphabetically by recipe name. The
//! client's own middle tiebreak (an item-template field) is SKIPPED — the one INFERRED remainder of
//! TU-B, named and pinned like [`TradeSkillDifficulty`]'s own INTERIM color law once was.
//!
//! Visible rows are each group's header (always shown) plus — for an uncollapsed group — its
//! recipes; every index the Era API takes/returns is 1-based into THAT list (mirrors
//! [`super::skills`]'s tree exactly: groups + collapse + visible-index remapping). `GetTradeSkillInfo`
//! on a header row returns `(groupName, "header", 0, isExpanded)`; `GetNumTradeSkills()` counts
//! visible rows; `GetFirstTradeSkill()` is the first NON-header visible index (`0` when none).
//! `Expand/CollapseTradeSkillSubClass(i)` fold a group by its header's VISIBLE index (`i == 0` =
//! ALL groups — the CollapseAll button's own call shape); the collapse set is keyed by group key
//! ([`Model::trade_skill_collapsed`]) and survives a `set_trade_skill` content re-push (pruned to
//! still-live groups). `GetTradeSkillSubClasses()` returns the current group names in group
//! order — the VERIFIED filter-dropdown vocabulary IS the header list, and it never shrinks
//! under a filter — and the `SubClassFilter`/`InvSlot` filter family is byte-VERIFIED (wow-re
//! `tradeskill` TU-G): the subclass filter is hidden group keys (the client's per-header
//! `+0xc` flag, position mask `0x84dd60` derived), the inv-slot filter is a shown-bit mask
//! (`0x84dd64`) over the accumulated slot vocabulary, [`rows`] drops filtered recipes and any
//! group left empty (a merely-collapsed group keeps its header), and every engine-side mutator
//! (a filter set, an expand/collapse) raises the `trade_skill_touched` flag the app answers with
//! `TRADE_SKILL_UPDATE` — the real client's in-call recompute+resort + event 0x13a (the
//! `0x4fd710`/`0x4fd730`/`0x4fd750` writer trio). Persistence is the client's `0xbde064`-keyed
//! story: filters, collapse, and the spell-id selection all survive a same-profession
//! close→reopen and reset on a profession switch ([`UiScript::set_trade_skill`]). The InvSlot
//! vocabulary folds each product's `InventoryType` through the dumped `DAT_00809200` table
//! ([`inv_slot_mask`] — WEAPON contributes both hand bits) and names bits via the `0x84dd70`
//! token table ([`inv_slot_name`]).
//!
//! Every per-recipe getter — `DoTradeSkill`, `GetTradeSkillIcon`/`NumMade`/`Cooldown`/`NumReagents`/
//! `ReagentInfo`/`Tools` — resolves its `index` through this same visible mapping via [`recipe_at`]
//! and no-ops/nil-shapes on a header row. **`SelectTradeSkill(i)` on a header index is IGNORED, not
//! cleared** — the ref's own `SetSelection` toggles the fold instead of selecting (ref l.184-192,
//! transcribed in the XML); the engine simply leaves the prior selection untouched. The selection
//! itself is held internally as a position into the OPEN WINDOW's FLAT `recipes` list — stable
//! across a collapse/expand (which never reorders `recipes`, only what's visible) and remapped by
//! spell id only across a `set_trade_skill` re-push ([`selected_visible_index`] derives the current
//! VISIBLE index from that flat position on every read, [`super::skills`]'s own by-identity
//! persistence pattern adapted to a field this module can't change the type of).
//!
//! ## The tooltip channel
//!
//! `GameTooltip:SetTradeSkillItem(skillIndex [, reagentIndex])` is registered in
//! [`super::tooltip_item`], beside `SetMerchantItem`, through the same id-keyed item renderer: with
//! `reagentIndex` it resolves that recipe's reagent's item, without it the recipe's PRODUCT item. A
//! product id of `0` (a pure-effect recipe) or an in-flight ask-once template answer both fall back to
//! the renderer's own name-only line — the recipe's name for the product channel — rather than a
//! no-op, since that fallback already exists and reads better than a blank hover.
//!
//! `skillIndex` is a **VISIBLE** index and is resolved through [`recipe_at`] (`pub(crate)` for
//! exactly this), never a raw [`TradeSkillState::recipes`] position — headers interleave with rows
//! since the TU-B grouping landed, so a raw index would show the wrong item the moment any group
//! precedes the selected recipe's own. A header index resolves to `None` and the hover is a no-op.
