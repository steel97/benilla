//! Per-handler cost attribution (`WOW_UI_HANDLERS=<secs>`) — *which* FrameXML handler is spending
//! the frame. An `impl UiScript` block beside its concern, the `layout.rs` pattern.
//!
//! ## Why it exists (decision 1395)
//!
//! Three perf hunts in a row — 1383's autocast shine, 1385's cast bar, 1388's layout graph — each
//! opened with the same question and each answered it **by hand**: read the shipped Lua, guess the
//! busy handler, add a temporary print, re-run. `[ui-cost] tick=` is one aggregate over the whole
//! `OnUpdate` sweep, so it can say *that* the sweep got expensive and never *who*. This is the
//! missing decomposition, and it sits one layer below the one that landed beside it: 1389's HUD
//! measures the frame's cost and latches its tail (`cpu`/`main` ms, the spike badge), which is
//! **when** and **how much**; this is **who**, inside the UI's share of it.
//!
//! ## What it measures
//!
//! Every handler fired through [`super::event::fire`] — the single firing path for `OnUpdate`,
//! `OnEvent`, `OnShow`/`OnHide`, `OnSizeChanged`, and the whole widget set (`OnClick`, `OnEnter`,
//! `OnValueChanged`, …). Not just the tick's `OnUpdate` sweep, deliberately: an event storm (the
//! combat log at 40 lines a second) costs frames the same way a hot `OnUpdate` does, and a `by
//! script:` rollup on the report line is what tells the two apart at a glance.
//!
//! **Self and total, because handler firing nests.** A handler that calls `Show()` fires `OnShow`
//! inside itself, and a handler that resizes something fires `OnSizeChanged`; charging the parent
//! for its children would name the wrong frame, which is the one failure this instrument cannot
//! afford. A stack of per-level child nanos gives both: `total` is what the call cost, `self` is
//! what it cost *itself*. Sorted by `self`.
//!
//! Engine work a handler provokes synchronously **is** its self time, and that is the point — a
//! geometry getter inside an `OnUpdate` calls `settle()`, which is a whole layout resolve
//! (1388's opening finding: `OptionsScroll_Fit` does four per frame). That cost belongs to the
//! handler that asked for it.
//!
//! ## What it costs when off
//!
//! One relaxed atomic load and a not-taken branch per handler fire ([`armed`]). The state lives in
//! its own `app_data` slot rather than in [`super::Model`]: mlua keys `app_data` by `TypeId` with a
//! **`RefCell` per entry** (`mlua-0.11.6`, `types/app_data.rs`), so the profiler's borrow can never
//! collide with a model borrow held across a fire — a hazard that would otherwise be a panic in the
//! hottest path in the client, armed only in the sessions where we are already chasing something.
