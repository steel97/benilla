//! `GetChannelName` — the joined-channel lookup, in both directions.
//!
//! **The state this reads already existed and was built for this verb.** `ui_chat::edit`'s
//! `ChannelState` has held `joined: Vec<String>` in join order since the chat arc, and its own doc
//! comment names `GetChannelName(n)` as the law it implements. Only the registration was missing —
//! the same silent-gap shape the loader arc kept finding, one layer up: the capability was built,
//! nothing exposed it, and nothing complained.
//!
//! Corpus demand, counted by reading every line rather than the grep total (1207): **17 sites
//! across 6 addons**, every one an unguarded call, no library replicated —
//! `ChatLog` 7, `Recap` 4, `SmartRes` 2, `Enchantrix` 2, `FuBar_AssistFu` 1, `_LazyPig` 1. Both
//! lookup directions are live in the corpus: by index (`GetChannelName(i)`) and by name
//! (`GetChannelName("world")`, `GetChannelName("Trade - City")`).
//!
//! Signature verified against wow-5875-re `system/ui/scratch/zone-chat-channel-autojoin.md`
//! l.374-380 — `GetChannelName = 0x4a05e0`, **three** returns:
//!
//! | # | the client's | ours |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | `slot[+0x00]`, the client-local **1-based joined-slot index** (= `CHAT_MSG_*` arg8) | the position in `joined` |
//! | 2 | `slot[+0x04]`, the channel name | the `joined` entry |
//! | 3 | `slot[+0x98]`, FrameXML's `instanceID` (= arg10) | **0** — see below |
//!
//! **Return 3 is 0, not nil, and that is a recorded position rather than a shrug.** It is the split
//! index from `YOU_JOINED`'s second u32, which `ui_chat::event`'s doc already records as "0 on every
//! vanilla emulator" and deliberately does not store. A client that one day meets a server which
//! splits channels would need the field; nothing in the corpus reads it.
