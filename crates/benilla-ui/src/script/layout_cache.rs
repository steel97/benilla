//! The **layout cache** — the consumer `Frame::user_placed` never had.
//!
//! `SetUserPlaced` / the drag entries set the client's userPlaced bit (`frame+0xb4 & 0x1000`,
//! [`super::object::movable`]), and together with the frame's own `movable`/`resizable` flags it
//! means *"the player put this window here; put it back next time"*. The real client honours that
//! by writing a per-character `layout-cache.txt` at logout and seating the frames from it at load;
//! benilla had the bit and nothing that read it, so a dragged or resized window went back to its
//! authored anchors on the next login.
//!
//! **The bit is not the whole gate**, at either end — see [`super::UiScript::user_placed_layouts`]
//! and [`super::UiScript::restore_user_placed_layouts`] for the conjuncts and their byte sites.
//! Reading it as the whole gate is what let one addon's stamp seat a stock frame forever
//! (decision 2193).
//!
//! This module is the **engine half** of that: a snapshot out, a restore in, and a dirty bit for
//! the host to debounce on. Where the file lives, when it is written and which character owns it
//! are the app's ([`benilla_app::ui_layout`] — `benilla-config/layout/<realm>-<character>.txt`,
//! through `local_state`, like every other resident of that folder).
//!
//! ## Why a host seam at all, when `GetPoint`/`SetPoint` exist
//!
//! Everything *about one frame* is already Lua-reachable — `GetNumPoints`, `GetPoint`, `GetWidth`,
//! `GetHeight`, `IsUserPlaced`, `SetPoint`, `SetWidth`, `SetHeight` — and if the saver knew which
//! frames to ask about, it would need nothing here. **Enumeration is the part Lua cannot do**:
//! there is no `EnumerateFrames` in 1.12 and inventing one would be a far wider surface than the
//! three functions below. The alternative — a hand-maintained list of names in FrameXML — is a
//! list that goes stale the first time a window becomes movable and nobody remembers to add it,
//! which is the failure mode the *bit* exists to prevent.
//!
//! So the seam is deliberately three calls wide and mirrors the chat-look seam next door
//! (`chat_window_looks` / `set_chat_window_looks` / `take_chat_window_changes`, decision 1589):
//! [`super::UiScript::user_placed_layouts`], [`super::UiScript::restore_user_placed_layouts`] and
//! [`super::UiScript::take_user_placed_change`].
//!
//! ## What a saved frame carries
//!
//! Its **name**, its **width/height**, and its **whole anchor list** — point, target, relative
//! point, offsets — because that is what `GetPoint` answers and what `SetPoint` takes. A frame is
//! addressed by name in the file for the obvious reason: handles are minted per session and mean
//! nothing across a relog.
//!
//! Two anchor targets survive the round trip and everything else drops the frame's row rather than
//! guessing:
//!
//! - the **screen root** ([`super::SCREEN`]) — written as no target, which is exactly what
//!   `GetPoint` answers there (`nil`, decision 0068's stated `UIParent` divergence);
//! - a **named frame** — written by name.
//!
//! An anchor onto an unnamed frame or onto a *region* cannot be re-addressed at load, so a frame
//! carrying one is skipped **whole**. Restoring half an anchor set would seat a window somewhere
//! nobody put it, which is worse than leaving it on its authored anchors.
