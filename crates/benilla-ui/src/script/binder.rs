//! The innkeeper-bind **Era API surface** (decision 1331) — two globals, no snapshot.
//!
//! These are the whole Lua side of setting a hearthstone, and they exist because the reference's
//! `CONFIRM_BINDER` dialog is written against exactly them (`StaticPopup.lua:1308-1322`):
//! `OnAccept` calls [`ConfirmBinder`], and `OnUpdate` hides the dialog the moment
//! [`CheckBinderDist`] goes false. Both are engine bindings in 1.12 (`reference/1.12-globals.tsv`
//! lists `ConfirmBinder` and `CheckBinderDist` as `function`/`engine`), and there are no others in
//! the family — the question itself arrives as the `CONFIRM_BINDER` event's argument, so there is
//! nothing to read back, exactly like [`super::duel`].
//!
//! The app owns the innkeeper's guid ([`crate::script::UiScript::set_binder_pending`]'s writer),
//! which is why `ConfirmBinder()` takes no arguments and queues only a count.
