//! Frame method-table cluster: the `toplevel` flag and the **raise law** — `SetToplevel`/
//! `IsToplevel`, `Raise`/`Lower`, and the engine-side worker every raise trigger runs. Split out of
//! [`super`] beside [`super::movable`], whose flag word this shares.
//!
//! This is "bring the window I just opened to the front". 82 corpus addons declare `toplevel=` in
//! XML and eleven call `SetToplevel` from Lua; our own shipped windows declare it on thirteen
//! frames. Until this module it was parsed and thrown away with a warn-once, so a benilla dialog
//! opened behind another one stayed behind it.
//!
//! ## The law (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/toplevel-raise.md`, §5 fan-out 2026-07-21 — VERIFIED)
//!
//! The flag is **`[frame+0xb4]` bit `0x1`**, written by the same pure bit-setter `0x76a3c0` as
//! `movable` (`0x100`) and `resizable` (`0x200`): `if (v) flags |= mask; else flags &= ~mask;`, no
//! calls, no list touch. XML `toplevel` lands there at `0x7698ec`; Lua `SetToplevel 0x775440` at
//! `0x7754d4`. **Setting the flag raises nothing** — it only marks the frame.
//!
//! The raise itself is `CSimpleTop::Raise(frame, force) 0x7650f0`, reached from
//! `CSimpleFrame::Raise 0x76a5b0` = `this->root->Raise(this, force = 1)`:
//!
//! 1. **Resolve to the nearest TOPLEVEL self-or-ancestor** up `+0x9c` (`0x7650fb..0x765135`).
//!    No toplevel in the chain ⇒ **total no-op**. So the gate lives in the worker, not the callers:
//!    every trigger may hand it an arbitrary frame, and the frame that visibly moves may be an
//!    *ancestor* of the one that was clicked or shown.
//! 2. **`force != 0` ⇒ recompute the OVERLAPPED bit** (`0x76513e..0x765290`): resolve the frame's
//!    pending layout, then scan its stratum bucket from **its own level upward** for a frame that is
//!    not itself, is not one of its descendants (`is_descendant 0x767010`), and whose screen rect
//!    intersects non-emptily. The answer is stored as `+0xb4` bit `0x10`.
//! 3. **The raise, gated on that bit** (`0x7651ac..0x7651e7`): `level_compact 0x764eb0` renumbers the
//!    stratum's occupied levels contiguously into `[0, count)`, then
//!    `set_frame_level(bucket->count, propagate = 1)`.
//!
//! Three consequences the tests pin: a raise is **`level := top occupied level + 1`**, not a list
//! reshuffle; it is **occlusion-gated** — `Raise()` on a frame that overlaps nothing changes nothing
//! at all; and it **never changes the stratum** (`0x7650f0` never writes `+0xc0`), so a LOW frame can
//! never be lifted over a MEDIUM one by any number of raises. `propagate = 1` shifts same-strata
//! children by the **same delta** (`0x76a4f0` @`0x76a58a`–`0x76a595`), so the raised subtree keeps
//! its internal order; cross-strata children are untouched.
//!
//! ## How that maps onto benilla's order model, clause by clause
//!
//! Our draw order is a derived total order over the arena ([`crate::order`]), not a materialized
//! array of per-stratum buckets of intrusive level lists. Every clause above still lands, but two
//! of them land as *derivations* and one is deliberately not stored:
//!
//! - **"the stratum bucket"** = the effective-visible frames whose `strata` matches. Bucket
//!   membership is exactly the client's link-gate: a frame is in a level list only while
//!   effectively visible, which is the same condition [`crate::widget::WidgetArena::resequence_to_tail`]
//!   already mirrors for the link stamp.
//! - **"raise within the strata"** = a **frame-level bump**, and it is the honest mapping rather
//!   than a re-stamp: the binary writes `+0xc4` through `set_frame_level 0x76a4f0`, and level is the
//!   term *above* the link stamp in our key, so a bump lifts the frame over every same-strata frame
//!   regardless of when each was last shown. The arithmetic is pinned in
//!   `tests/toplevel.rs::a_raise_is_top_occupied_level_plus_one_after_compaction`.
//! - **`level_compact`** is [`crate::widget::WidgetArena::compact_levels`] — an order-preserving
//!   renumber of the visible frames in one stratum. It changes no draw order by itself; it is what
//!   keeps `level := max + 1` from ratcheting upward for the length of a session.
//! - **The OVERLAPPED bit is computed, never stored** — and that is *exact*, not a shortcut. The bit
//!   is written only by `0x7650f0` and the per-tick pass `0x7657d0`, and read only by `0x7650f0`,
//!   which with `force = 1` recomputes it immediately before reading it. The stored value is
//!   therefore observable **only** through the one `force = 0` call site, `0x764a20`
//!   (bucket-invalidate), which rides an already-computed bit. benilla has no bucket-invalidate
//!   call — every trigger we have is a `force = 1` one — so the per-tick maintenance `0x7657d0`
//!   would be state nothing could read. A local `bool` per raise is bit-for-bit what `force = 1`
//!   does. **If a `force = 0` trigger is ever built, the bit has to become a field and `0x7657d0` a
//!   per-tick pass; there is no other clause of this law that is unmodelled.**
//!
//! ## The screen rects the gate reads
//!
//! Step 2 needs rects, which live on [`Model::resolved`], not on the arena. `0x7650f0` starts by
//! resolving the frame's *own* pending layout (`0x76513e`: `if (T->+0x60 & 1) …0x7680e0`) and then
//! reads every other frame's cached rect as-is; [`raise`] does the same thing with the one resolve
//! we have — [`crate::script::UiScript::resolve_layout`], whose epoch gate makes it a `u64` compare
//! on the overwhelmingly common quiet call (showing a frame writes no layout input, so a Show-driven
//! raise never pays a solve unless the caller moved something in the same tick). Our solve covers
//! hidden frames too, so a frame being shown for the first time already has a rect to test. A frame
//! with **no** resolved rect (anchorless, so not on screen) overlaps nothing and raises nothing.
//!
//! ## Triggers — the census, and which ones benilla wires
//!
//! wow-re's complete rel32 + absolute-dword census finds six call sites. Ours:
//!
//! | site | what it is | benilla |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `0x775b0a` (Lua `Frame:Raise()`) | the explicit script call | [`install`] |
//! | `0x76aeec` in `effective_visible_show 0x76ae10` | **the Show trigger** | [`raise_on_show`], run from [`crate::script::event::fire_visibility_changes`] |
//! | `0x7652d7` in begin-move `0x7652b0` | drag start | [`super::movable`]'s `start_moving` |
//! | `0x766392` in the mouse-down handler `0x7662c0` | **the click trigger** | [`crate::script::UiScript::mouse_button`]'s down arm, first thing — capture-else-hover, unguarded, ahead of the title-region swallow |
//! | `0x764a4c` (`force = 0`) | re-applies an already-computed bit `0x10` | no counterpart (see the OVERLAPPED note above) |
//! | `0x7650d6` | dead — zero references binary-wide | — |
//!
//! **`Frame:Lower()` is inert in build 5875** and inert here: `0x775b20` → `0x76a5c0` → `0x7652a0`,
//! which is `xor eax,eax; ret 4` — a verified no-op stub whose frame argument is never read.
