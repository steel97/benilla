//! The `/who` list's sort — the reference's seven-slot key chain, its promote-and-flip rule, and
//! the comparator that walks it (`SortWho 0x5ad890`, comparator `0x5ada00`; wow-re
//! `system/net/scratch/who-list-sort-law.md`, §5-crossed 2026-09-05, benilla decision 2030).
//!
//! **A `/who` sort is not "order by the clicked column".** The reference keeps a *chain* of seven
//! `{key, dir}` slots at `0xc2817c`/`0xc28180`, seeded once per process to `key[i] = i`
//! (`0x5add04`), i.e. **zone → level → class → group → name → race → guild**, every direction
//! ascending. Each click *promotes* its key to the front of that chain; the keys it displaces
//! stay behind it, so the chain reads most-recently-used first and the comparator walks it as a
//! **tie-breaker list**, not as a single key. Two players on the same level keep whatever order
//! the previously clicked key gave them.
//!
//! Two consequences that are the whole of bug B365:
//!
//! - **A repeated click reverses.** The promote flips the direction **only when the key was
//!   already at the front** (`0x5ad99e`–`0x5ad9a7`, the `sete` on `i == 0`); promoting a key from
//!   anywhere else carries its *remembered* direction over unchanged. So Name, Name reverses; but
//!   Name, Level, Name does **not** — the second Name click restores the direction the first one
//!   left there.
//! - **Nothing here is a request to the server.** The chain and the comparator are engine state;
//!   `SortWho` sorts the array it already holds and fires `WHO_LIST_UPDATE` synchronously, inside
//!   the binding ([`super::social`]'s `SortWho`).
//!
//! The chain is **per-process** in the reference — its initialiser `0x5adc50` runs once from the
//! process-start run at `0x401666` — so it survives a logout and the next login inherits it.
//! `SocialState::clear_session` on the app side keeps it for that reason.
