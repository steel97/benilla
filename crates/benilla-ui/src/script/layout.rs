/// ## Tier 2 of a two-tier gate (decision 0740)
///
/// This fingerprint began as the WHOLE gate, chosen over a dirty flag because a flag has sites to
/// miss and a fingerprint is computed FROM the read set — any change moves it by construction.
/// That safety cost ~0.6 ms *every idle frame* at a live pin (hashing ~2k inputs to conclude
/// "quiet"), which is why the mutation epoch ([`Model::touch_layout`], tier 1) now sits in front:
/// a frame with no layout-visible write skips at a `u64` compare and never reaches this hash. The
/// fingerprint remains load-bearing where the flag is structurally weak — a *dirty* frame whose
/// writes were idempotent (the bag-hover re-enter loop clears and rebuilds identical content
/// every frame; the GameTooltip pre-pass rewrites tooltip sizes every call) hashes clean here and
/// still skips the solve. And the flag's own failure mode — a missed touch site, a silently stale
/// layout — is machine-checked: under [`layout_verify_enabled`] (forced on in this crate's tests)
/// a tier-1-quiet frame asserts the fingerprint agrees, so the tiers police each other.
///
/// ## Why 128 bits
///
/// A collision here is not self-healing: the skip keeps the stored value, so a colliding change
/// would stay unresolved until something *else* moved. Two independent lanes put that beyond
/// physical concern (~2^-128 per frame) at the cost of one extra multiply per item.
///
/// ## Order sensitivity is safe
///
/// The accumulator is order-dependent, and it is fed by walking `HashMap`s whose iteration order
/// is arbitrary. That order is nevertheless *stable for an unmutated map*, so an unchanged model
/// reproduces the value; a mutated map may reorder and merely re-resolves. The failure mode is a
/// false DIRTY (a wasted resolve), never a false CLEAN (a stale rect).
