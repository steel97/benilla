//! The draw-order primitive — the strata/layer vocabulary and the packed total-order key
//! (`ZKey`), plus the visible-tree [`traversal`] that realizes the client's painter order
//! (decision 0068).
//!
//! ## Ground truth (wow-5875-re, binary-verified)
//!
//! The 1.12.1 client draws in a **flat painter's order**, *not* a hierarchical walk: every visible
//! frame — children included — is an independent entry in a per-`(strata, level)` bucket
//! (`propagation.md`, `propagation-anchors.md`). A child frame with a *lower* strata/level than its
//! parent therefore draws *before* the parent — the order is global, keyed on the tuple below, not
//! on the tree shape.
//!
//! **Inside one `(strata, level)` bucket, the DRAW LAYER outranks the frame.** The five render
//! batches belong to the level node (`levelNode+0x1c`), not to any frame, and the emitter
//! `0x765920` loops `layer = 0..4` outside and frames inside. So a bucket emits every frame's
//! BACKGROUND, then every frame's BORDER, and so on — regions are *not* grouped behind their owning
//! frame. Within one layer the same is true of kind: the batch holds a quad sub-array and a text
//! sub-array, and `0x76fb00` drains all quads before any text, so **all** textures of a
//! `(strata, level, layer)` precede **all** its font strings. (Decision 0884, wow-re
//! `ui/scratch/draw-order-law.md`. This supersedes the earlier recorded key, which had no layer
//! term at all and read the last term backwards.)
//!
//! ## The total order (most- to least-significant)
//!
//! `(stratum, frame level, draw layer, texture<fontstring, frame link-stamp, is-region, sub-level,
//! declaration order)` — packed big-endian-by-priority into one sortable [`ZKey`] (`u64`), so the
//! whole render list is produced by one sort on the key. The `is-region` bit is benilla's own: the
//! binary has no frame-level drawable (only regions draw), so it sits *below* the layer key purely
//! to keep a frame's backdrop/scissor slot ahead of that frame's own regions.
//!
//! The **link-stamp** is the client's live intrusive-list position, not a creation index: a frame is
//! (re)linked at its bucket on becoming visible, on a strata change, and on a *changing* level set
//! — later link = drawn on top. A monotonic global counter bumped at those same moments is
//! order-equivalent within any one bucket, which is what [`crate::widget::WidgetArena`] keeps.
//!
//! **Below the layer, the frame term is exact for font strings and a deterministic stand-in for
//! textures.** The client re-sorts each layer's quad array by *texture handle* (`0x7731a0`) and
//! never sorts the text sub-array. A texture handle is an internal allocation our texture manager
//! assigns differently, so we reproduce the client's pre-sort array instead — identical wherever a
//! layer's quads share a texture or don't overlap. **No content may depend on the relative order of
//! two overlapping textures within one layer.**
//!
//! ## Era deltas (designed-for, not invented)
//!
//! - **`BLIZZARD` stratum** — the modern engine adds exactly one stratum *above* `TOOLTIP`
//!   (decision 0068 §"strict superset"; the 1.12 `UI.xsd`↔Era diff). It is the last [`Strata`]
//!   variant; 1.12 content never selects it.
//! - **`textureSubLevel`** — an i8 ordering knob *within* a draw layer, first-class in Era. 0884's
//!   §5 found **no sub-level in 5875 at all** (`0x76a860` takes only `(region, layer)` and
//!   head-inserts with no comparator; the per-layer header is a plain 0xc-byte triple with nowhere
//!   to keep a sort key), correcting the earlier note that placed one in the 1.12 region lists. The
//!   `sub_level` field stays as the Era delta and is inert for 1.12 content.

//
// ## Why the draw layer outranks the frame (decision 0884 — §5-VERIFIED)
//
// **The five render batches belong to the LEVEL NODE, not to the frame** (`levelNode+0x1c`, five
// 0x30-byte batches), and the emitter `0x765920` loops `layer = 0..4` on the OUTSIDE and frames on
// the inside. So the draw layer is a **bucket-wide** key: every frame sharing a `(strata, level)`
// emits its BACKGROUND regions, then every frame its BORDER, then ARTWORK, then OVERLAY, then
// HIGHLIGHT. It is not a within-frame ordering — which is what benilla modeled until 0884, with
// the frame term ranked above the layer so a frame's regions stayed glued behind it.
//
// That inversion is what put the mirror timer's blue fill over its own border art and caption
// (director report, 2026-08-02). The reference builds those bars as a Frame whose OVERLAY layer
// carries the border + caption, with a child StatusBar whose `<BarTexture>` takes the default
// **ARTWORK** layer and whose only OnLoad is `SetFrameLevel(GetFrameLevel() - 1)`. That line does
// **not** put the child below the parent: a child is born at `parent.level + 1` (`SetParent
// 0x76ab10` @`0x76ab65`), so the `-1` lands it at *exactly* the parent's level. Its whole job is to
// **create the tie**, so the layer key can decide — ARTWORK(2) before OVERLAY(3), fill under
// chrome. Ranked below the frame, there was no tie to resolve and the child always trailed.
//
// **`texture < fontstring` is bucket-wide too, and outranks the frame.** A layer's batch holds two
// independent sub-arrays — the quad array `[batch+0x10]` (every `CSimpleTexture` appends via
// `0x7706e0` → `0x772fd0`) and the text sub-batch `[batch+0x18]` (`0x772e50` → `0x773080`) — and
// `0x76fb00` drains the WHOLE quad array before it touches the text one. So for two frames A, B at
// one `(strata, level, layer)`, each with a texture and a font string, the client emits
// `A.tex, B.tex, A.text, B.text` — never `A.tex, A.text, B.tex, B.text`.
//
// **The frame link-stamp below that is exact for font strings and a deterministic stand-in for
// textures.** The client re-sorts a layer's quad array by *texture handle* (`0x7731a0`'s qsort,
// comparator `0x7731c0`) and never sorts the text sub-batch. The handle is an internal allocation
// our texture manager assigns differently, so reproducing that sort is neither achievable nor
// desirable; we reproduce the client's PRE-sort array, which agrees wherever a layer's quads share
// a texture or don't overlap (the common case). **No content may depend on the relative order of
// two overlapping textures within one layer** — that is not a fidelity invariant.
//
// wow-re's own previously-recorded key — `(strata, level, insertion order)` — is superseded by the
// same §5: it carried no layer term at all.
//
// A frame's own entry zeroes the layer and everything below `is-region`, so it precedes its own
// BACKGROUND regions. That slot is benilla's backdrop/scissor hook, not the client's — in the
// binary a frame has no drawable of its own — so it sits *below* the layer key, never above it.
//
// **`sub-level` is inert on 1.12**: §5 found no sub-level in 5875 at all (`0x76a860` takes only
// `(region, layer)`, head-inserts with no comparator, and the per-layer header is a plain 0xc-byte
// triple with nowhere to keep a sort key). The field stays as the modeled Era delta; no 1.12
// content sets it, so it is always the `0` bias.

/// **The index is FLAT** — sorted `(strata, frame level, insertion order)`, with no parent/child
/// nesting term at all, which is exactly [`traversal`]'s key. The tie is the part that matters and
/// the part we had backwards: `0x764aa0`'s comparison is a strict `ja`, so a frame arriving at a
/// level that already exists is **appended after** its equals, and the sweep from index 0 therefore
/// reaches the **earlier-linked** frame first. `SetFrameLevel` relinks the parent before recursing
/// into children, and effective-Show registers self (`0x76ae85`) before its children (`0x76aeb6`) —
/// so at equal levels **the parent wins over its own child**.
///
/// That is the whole reason `TargetFrame_OnLoad`'s `SetFrameLevel(textureFrame-1)` on the two bars
/// works: the bars land at exactly `TargetFrame`'s own level, and the tie goes to the frame that
/// registered first. Walking the draw order in reverse — which is what this did until the carve —
/// inverts it and hands the click to the child, so right-clicking a unit frame opened nothing.
///
/// **The SIBLING case is the one that bites hardest, and it is why this is not a local fix**
/// (decision 1816). All children of one parent share `parent.level + 1`, so every sibling set is one
/// big tie, resolved purely by declaration order — and under the true law the FIRST-declared sibling
/// wins, not the last. A full-area mouse-enabled overlay declared at the top of a `<Frames>` list
/// therefore swallows its whole window. Five of our own windows shipped exactly that (the
/// `*WheelCatcher` `<Button>`s), correct only under the inverted order and removed with this carve;
/// `SkillFrame.xml` had already recorded one shipped bug from the same shape. Note that
/// `<Button>` is mouse-enabled by its *constructor* (decision 1795), so such an overlay needs no
/// `enableMouse` to compete — the wheel is a separate index and needs no mouse hit target at all.
///
/// Drawing is unaffected and stays later-on-top: this reordering is the HIT sweep's alone.
///
/// Pure over its inputs: `sorted` is draw-order-**ascending** (as [`traversal`] returns), and
/// `hits(frame)` reports whether that frame is a capture candidate at the cursor. Visibility is
