//! **UI source bytes** — what a `.lua`, `.xml` or `.toc` file *is*, before any parser sees it.
//!
//! One rule, and it is the reference's: **a UI source file is bytes, not text.** wow-5875-re has
//! the whole path byte-verified (`system/ui/scratch/lua-chunk-load-encoding.md`, a §5 trio run for
//! this decision): `0x704bc0` slurps the file (`0x648620`) with `pad = 0`, so there is not even a
//! trailing NUL, the handle is opened **binary** on every leg of `0x647db0`, and `0x704ae0` hands
//! the pointer and length straight to `luaL_loadbuffer 0x6f5690`. No transcoding, no codepage
//! conversion; the only `WideCharToMultiByte` on the path converts the *path*. Lua 5.0 strings
//! *are* byte strings, so a cp1252 German locale file loads there and its literals carry the raw
//! bytes.
//!
//! Two things the compiler's front door does do, and we do them too because they are the
//! reference's own code rather than Lua's: it **strips a UTF-8 BOM** ([`strip_bom`] — ten
//! instructions Blizzard patched into `luaL_loadbuffer`) and it **eats a leading `#`-line**
//! ([`strip_hashbang`] — Lua 5.0 puts that in `luaX_setinput`, where every chunk passes; 5.1 moved
//! it somewhere mlua never calls).
//!
//! benilla read every one of these files with `read_to_string` until decision 1193, which meant a
//! file that was not valid UTF-8 did not merely lose a glyph — it **did not exist**: the read
//! returned `None` and the loader reported "not found". Measured over a real 218-addon vanilla
//! corpus, that is **80 addons of 218** (37 %): 76 non-UTF-8 `.lua` files, 5 non-UTF-8 `.toc`
//! files (which made those addons invisible to discovery entirely), and 160 files carrying a UTF-8
//! BOM. `AceAddon-2.0.lua` is one of them, and it is embedded in ~30 addons — one library file
//! taking out the whole Ace/FuBar half of the ecosystem.
//!
//! ## Two verbs, because there are two kinds of consumer
//!
//! - [`strip_bom`] + raw bytes → **Lua chunks**. Byte-transparent, exactly as the reference.
//!   `string.len()` on a literal returns what it returns there, and byte-indexing agrees.
//! - [`decode`] → **our own parsers** (FrameXML XML, `.toc`), which need `&str` because Rust
//!   parsers do. This is the only place a guess is made, and it is made where it is cheapest.
//!
//! **Why not transcode the Lua too, so everything downstream is UTF-8?** Because that would
//! silently change `string.len`, `string.sub` and `string.byte` on every non-ASCII literal — a
//! divergence from the verified mechanism, bought for a rendering convenience. The right place to
//! turn bytes into text is the boundary that actually requires text, which is a Rust binding
//! signature, not the file loader. A stray byte should cost one glyph, not the file.

/// have failed on the real client too, so stripping it was us being kinder than the original. An
/// RE dispatch into wow-5875-re read the bytes instead of the manual: **Blizzard patched the strip
/// into `luaL_loadbuffer 0x6f5690` themselves.** Ten instructions stock Lua does not have
/// (`0x6f5699`–`0x6f56b4`): a `size >= 3` guard, three byte compares against `EF BB BF`, then
/// `add edx,3` / `sub eax,3` — all before the `LoadS` fill and `lua_load 0x6f4320`. That is the
/// only live door into the compiler, so addon files, FrameXML, XML script bodies and `loadstring`
/// all get it. The `.toc` reader has its own separate skip at `0x6edc71`.

/// The lexer reasoning was right and the conclusion drawn from it was wrong: `luaX_lex 0x6ff610`

/// beats a correct-sounding derivation, every time.

/// 0, and a file shorter than three bytes is untouched (a BOM-only file compiles as an empty
/// chunk). A UTF-16 BOM (`FF FE` / `FE FF`) is left alone — the reference does not handle one
