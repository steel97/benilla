//! **The tree's one civil-time conversion** — broken-down UTC from an epoch second.
//!
//! It lives here because this crate already had to have one: 1.12's `date()` global is Lua 5.0's
//! `os.date` hoisted, and the sandbox strips `os` ([`crate::script`]'s stdlib), so the calendar
//! had to be written by hand. The screenshot writer is its second caller (decision 1487), and one
//! correct closed form with two callers beats two hand-rolled loops.
//!
//! **UTC, deliberately, and it is a stated divergence wherever a caller wanted local time.** The
//! workspace has no date dependency at all — every format crate in it is in-repo — and resolving a
//! local offset needs a timezone source, not a different algorithm. `date()` records the same
//! divergence for the same reason.

/// Broken-down UTC time.
