//! **`Bindings.xml`** — an addon's key-binding declaration (decision 1188 phase 4).
//!
//! The reference loads one per addon, at a verified position inside `AddOn_Load 0x51f240`
//! (wow-5875-re `system/ui/ui.md`): **after** that addon's `.toc`-listed files (`0x51f3fa`) and
//! **before** its saved-variables files (`0x51f400` → `0x51f4b5`). Both of benilla's load paths
//! attach there — the startup walk (`benilla_app::ui_script::addons`) and the demand load
//! ([`crate::script::addon`]) — and what they parse here feeds the same table the Key Bindings
//! window edits ([`crate::script::keybind`]).
//!
//! ## The format, read off the client's own file, not remembered
//!
//! `Interface\FrameXML\Bindings.xml` (extracted 1.12.1) is **228 live `<Binding>` elements**,
//! every one named, and the whole schema it uses is six attributes: `name` (228), `runOnUp` (94),
//! `header` (13), `hidden` (12), `debug` (9), `platform` (5).
//!
//! *Live*, because a text search says 234: six more sit inside an XML comment — Blizzard commented
//! out the whole `MOVEVIEW*` family in place. A parser that finds bindings by scanning text (and
//! any count taken by `grep`) registers those six as real, which is why the counts here are the
//! ones this module's own parse returns and why `a_commented_out_binding_is_not_a_binding` exists.
//!
//! ```xml
//! <Bindings>
//!     <Binding name="MOVEFORWARD" runOnUp="true" header="MOVEMENT">
//!         if ( keystate == "down" ) then MoveForwardStart(); else MoveForwardStop(); end
//!     </Binding>
//! </Bindings>
//! ```
//!
//! - **The body is ONE Lua chunk, run once or twice.** A `runOnUp="true"` binding runs on the
//!   press *and again* on the release, with the global `keystate` set to `"down"` / `"up"` — which
//!   is why every shipped `runOnUp` body is an `if ( keystate == "down" )` fork. A binding without
//!   it runs once, on the press. (Our own registry says the same thing a second way:
//!   `benilla_app::bindings::commands::Kind::EdgeUpDown` holds the two halves as two strings,
//!   because a host command's halves are ours to write. An addon's is one string and a global.)
//! - **`header` is a GLOBAL-STRING KEY, and it opens a SECTION.** `header="MOVEMENT"` means the
//!   category `BINDING_HEADER_MOVEMENT`, and every following binding *without* a `header` belongs
//!   to it: 13 headers over 228 bindings is 13 sections, and the client's own list is flat with
//!   `HEADER_*` pseudo-entries in it (`Blizzard_BindingUI.lua:87` tests
//!   `strsub(commandName, 1, 6) == "HEADER"`). The carry-forward is applied at *registration*, not
//!   here, so this type stays a faithful record of what the file says — see
//!   [`crate::script::UiScript::register_addon_bindings`].
//! - **`hidden="true"` keeps a binding out of the Key Bindings window** while leaving it bindable
//!   and dispatchable — 1.12 uses it for the debug toggles and for the three mouselook bindings
//!   (`TURNORACTION`, `CAMERAORSELECTORMOVE`, …) that the mouse owns rather than the player.
//! - **`platform="mac"` is the file's own OS gate**, and its five uses are the whole of it: the
//!   `ITUNES_REMOTE` block, which remotes the *system* music player and therefore exists only in
//!   the Mac build. It is carried on [`AddonBinding::platform`] and acted on at registration
//!   ([`crate::script::UiScript::register_addon_bindings`]) — a row for another platform is not
//!   registered at all, so it never reaches the Key Bindings window, a save file, or a chord.
//!   Registering it instead would list a command whose body calls functions this build does not
//!   have, which is a row that can only ever error on its first press.
//! - `debug="true"` is **read and not acted on**: it appears only on the client's own nine
//!   hidden dev toggles, always together with `hidden="true"` (which IS acted on and is what
//!   keeps them out of the window), and no addon in the wild uses it. Recording that it exists is
//!   the point; inventing a second meaning for it would be a guess.
//!
//! ## Why this lives beside `toc` and `framexml` rather than under `script/`
//!
//! It is the third of the client's **file formats**, and the crate's top level is where a format
//! becomes owned data with no VM in sight: [`crate::toc`] turns manifest text into a load list,
//! [`crate::framexml`] turns document text into a tree, and this turns binding text into
//! [`AddonBinding`]s. `script/` is the other side of that line — the live Lua-facing runtime,
//! which *consumes* what these three produce. A parser under `script/keybind` would also be
//! unreachable from the host's own load path without going through the VM, which is exactly the
//! shape 1186 spent a decision untangling.
//!
//! XML *parsing* is delegated plumbing here for the same reason it is in [`crate::framexml`] (the
//! RE spec's own split: "XML parsing is DELEGATED; the schema→op map is owned") — `roxmltree`
//! reads the bytes, and only the schema→meaning map below is ours.
