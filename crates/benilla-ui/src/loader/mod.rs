//! The FrameXML **loader** (decision 0068): the join between the document layer ([`crate::framexml`])
//! and the runtime ([`crate::script`]). It walks a parsed FrameXML document and *materializes* it —
//! turning `<Include>`/`<Script>` sequencing, template instances, `<Layers>` regions, nested
//! `<Frames>`, and `<Scripts>` handlers into live frames in a running [`UiScript`] — by driving the
//! FrameScript object model exactly as an addon does (the `CreateFrame` global + the widget/region
//! method surface installed in [`crate::script`]), never by reaching into the arena directly.
//!
//! ## Ground truth (wow-5875-re, closed VERIFIED ORCHESTRATION region `0x6edc00–0x6f3000`)
//!
//! - `system/ui/scratch/rf24-framexml-loader.md` — the element→op map this module transcribes: the
//!   top-level `<Include>`/`<Script>`/`<Font>`/frame routing (`0x6ede10`), `LoadXML` attribute
//!   handling (`hidden`/`toplevel`/`movable`/`frameStrata`/`frameLevel`/`alpha`/`enableMouse`,
//!   `0x769820`), `<Size>` + `<Anchors>` → `SetWidth`/`SetHeight`/`SetPoint` (`0x767800`), and
//!   `<Layers>`/`<Layer>`/`<Texture>`/`<FontString>` (`0x769d70`), `<Scripts>` → `SetScript`
//!   (`0x769ef0`).
//! - `system/ui/scratch/rf26-nested-frames.md` — `LoadChildFrames 0x76a060`: nested `<Frames>` is a
//!   post-load pass that gives **bottom-up `OnLoad` ordering** (a frame's children are fully built,
//!   and their `OnLoad`s fired, *before* the parent's `OnLoad` runs).
//! - `system/ui/scratch/rf27-parent-name-token.md` — `SetName 0x76c650` / the `$parent` token, applied
//!   here (via [`crate::framexml::resolve_name`]) to frame/region names and to anchor `relativeTo`.
//!
//! ## The engine-free seam
//!
//! `<Include>`/`<Script file=>` need file bytes, which this crate must not read itself (no Bevy, no
//! IO — decision 0068 §1). The app supplies a `files` closure that resolves a FrameXML path to its
//! **bytes** (from the MPQ/addon dir); the loader stays IO-free.
//!
//! **Bytes, not text** (decision 1193). A `<Script file=>` chunk is handed to Lua as the bytes on
//! disk, exactly as the reference's `luaL_loadbuffer` receives them; only an `<Include>`d document
//! is decoded ([`crate::source::decode`]), because roxmltree needs `&str` and Lua does not. Before
//! 1193 the provider returned `String`, so a cp1252 locale file did not lose a glyph — it read as
//! *absent*, and the include or every handler in the script vanished with it.
//!
//! **The loader owns relative-path resolution; the provider owns the root** (decision 1186). A
//! reference is relative to the directory of the *file that contains it*, and may walk up with `..`
//! — `Bagnon/src/main.xml` reaches its sibling as `templates.xml` and a shared library addon as
//! `..\..\BagBrother\core\core.xml`. Only the loader knows the include tree, so it does the joining
//! ([`join_ref`]) and hands the provider one already-resolved path; the provider decides what that
//! path is allowed to reach. [`load`] starts at the root, [`load_in`] starts at a named directory.
//!
//! A path with **no provider hit gets its own list**, [`LoadReport::missing_files`] — neither a
//! warning nor an error (decision 2155). It was a warning until 1186, and the cost was that an
//! addon which resolved *nothing* reported success — Bagnon missed all eleven of its references
//! and came back with zero errors. 1186 answered that by calling it an error, which fixed the
//! visibility and got the *severity* wrong the other way: the reference logs `"Couldn't open %s"`
//! and carries on, with nothing raised, so an addon shipping an incomplete package was scoring as
//! a client script error and reaching the player's red error dialog. Both facts are true and they
//! need two different lists. The load continues either way (0068: the client logs and carries on).
//!
//! ## MAXCSTACK discipline (decision 0068, probe A)
//!
//! Like the host it drives, the loader holds **no** breadth-wise accumulation of Lua handles: a
//! frame's wrapper `Table` and its (optional) `OnLoad` `Function` live only on the Rust stack across
//! *that frame's own* subtree build (depth-bounded), and region wrappers are dropped as soon as their
//! visuals are applied. Everything durable lives Lua-side in the host's registry.
