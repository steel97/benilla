//! The client's **message catalog** — the one table that decides where a UI message is shown.
//!
//! Every user-visible refusal, notice and confirmation the engine raises goes through a single
//! function, `CGGameUI::DisplayError` (`0x496720`), which takes a **message id** and nothing else.
//! The id indexes the registry at `0xb4b498`, 465 records of 20 bytes:
//!
//! | offset | field | what it is |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `+0x00` | [`MessageRecord::key`] | the `GlobalStrings.lua` key, resolved by `FrameScript_GetText` |
//! | `+0x04` | [`MessageRecord::kind`] | **where it goes** — the four-way jump at `0x496888` ([`MsgKind`]) |
//! | `+0x08` | [`MessageRecord::sound`] | a sound cue name, or nothing |
//! | `+0x0c` | [`MessageRecord::type_tag`] | `0x44` = play the cue; anything else is an error-speech id |
//! | `+0x10` | [`MessageRecord::chat_type`] | the chat type handed to `0x49a870` — read on [`MsgKind::Chat`] only |
//!
//! **Why this table is in the tree at all.** benilla names ~160 of these keys across a dozen
//! modules, and until now every one of them arrived by hand-tracing a `push <id>; call 0x496720`
//! in the binary and reading the record by eye — the key *and* the surface, carried separately to
//! the call site, with nothing checking they agreed. That is how [`super::script`]'s petition lines
//! got their split wrong on the first try (`ui_petition::lines`' own module doc records it), and
//! it is a tax on every future message. The registry is a **fact about the client**, of exactly the
//! kind this project already carries as code — opcode numbers, struct offsets, DBC schemas — so it
//! belongs here as a table, once, instead of being re-derived per call site. Nothing localized
//! ships with it: the *keys* are `GlobalStrings.lua` identifiers (interface code, decision 1602)
//! and the text itself is still read at runtime out of the player's own install.
//!
//! It is **generated**, never hand-edited — `scripts/gen-message-catalog.py` from wow-5875-re's
//! `re/ui/message-catalog.tsv`, whose extractor decodes the CRT static initializer
//! `[0x484ca0, 0x488408)` that fills the table.
//!
//! **What the sweep settles that guessing could not:** the split does not follow the key names.
//! `ERR_PETITION_SIGNED_S` is a chat line and `ERR_PETITION_ALREADY_SIGNED` is a red toast;
//! `ERR_FISH_ESCAPED` is yellow and `ERR_INV_FULL` is red. 170 rows are [`MsgKind::Chat`], 28 are
//! [`MsgKind::Info`], 267 are [`MsgKind::Error`] — and **none is the console arm**, which the
//! dispatcher has and this build's table never reaches (`0x63cb50`'s console lines are called
//! directly, not through a record), so [`MsgKind`] models three.
