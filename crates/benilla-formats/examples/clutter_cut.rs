//! **How the ground-clutter fade boundary cuts** — pixel by pixel, or leaf by leaf?
//!
//! `cargo run -p benilla-formats --example clutter_cut [substring]`
//!
//! The detail-doodad draw alpha-tests `texel.a × ramp(view_depth)` against `detailDoodadAlpha`
//! (128/255), so as the ramp falls the surviving set is `{ texel.a ≥ 0.502 / ramp }`. Whether that
//! reads as a tuft *eroding* — the boundary sweeping through a leaf a pixel at a time — or as the
//! leaf *flipping whole* is decided entirely by the alpha distribution **at the mip the tuft is
//! sampled at**. The alpha arithmetic is settled and identical either way, so when the cut looks
//! wrong the answer is in what is being cut, not in the cutting.
//!
//! Per atlas, per mip level, three numbers:
//!
//! * **`distinct`** — how many distinct alpha values the level carries. **`2` means binary**: the
//!   product `a × ramp` is then either `0` or `ramp`, so the alpha test degenerates to a global
//!   on/off and *every texel of every leaf crosses the threshold at the same view depth*. No
//!   erosion is possible at such a level, at any distance, ever.
//! * **coverage** across the fade band — the share of the atlas still drawn at each depth. Sliding
//!   down = the tuft erodes. Holding flat then dropping to zero = the tuft pops.
//! * **cliff** — how much of the still-drawn coverage goes in the last 0.2 yd before the crossing.
//!   100% means everything that was left leaves in one step.
//!
//! The header line also prints the BLP's own `compression / alpha_bits / alpha_type / has_mips`,
//! because the shipped art is not uniform: some detail atlases carry a properly averaged mip
//! pyramid and some carry a **binary-thresholded** one, and the two behave completely differently
//! at the boundary. Parsed inline from the documented BLP2 layout rather than through the decoder,
//! so this reports what the *file* says independently of how we read it.
