//! Where does a welded billboard bone's geometry SIT relative to its pivot — how far, and along
//! which local axis?
//!
//! Two readings, and the second is the one that decides anything. **Distance** answers the seam
//! question: a partially-weighted seam vertex is dragged by its weight times the re-orientation and
//! linear-blend skinning shrinks it toward the pivot on the way (the candy-wrapper), so a seam ring
//! sitting ON the pivot hinges cleanly and one sitting far out tears.
//!
//! **Direction answers whether the geometry moves at all.** A spherical billboard maps the bone's
//! local axes onto fixed camera axes, so an offset lying along a single local axis lands on the same
//! camera axis from every angle: it does not sweep, it only loses its roll and its foreshortening.
//! Only an offset spread across the axes sweeps. Magnitude alone cannot tell those apart, and
//! reading a 0.29 yd radius as a 0.29 yd arc is exactly how decision 0847 withdrew a correct change
//! — the spikes it measured run **along** their bone (worst vertex 12° off axis), so the sweep it
//! described never existed (wow-re `billboard-bone-law.md` §6.3, and this tool's own output).
//!
//! Usage: `cargo run -p benilla-formats --example seamswing -- <WoW/Data> <internal\path.m2>`
