//! What the ADT liquid actually **is** under a pin — the shoreline instrument:
//! `cargo run -p benilla-formats --example water_here -- <map> <x> <y> [radius_yd]`
//! e.g. `water_here Azeroth -12512.69 -180.21 40`.
//!
//! A water-at-the-shore report ("there's a step in it", "the foam runs past the waterline") is a
//! question about three surfaces that only ever agree in the middle of a lake: the MCLQ **wet-cell
//! lattice** (4.167-yd cells, the granularity everything on the water path clips to), the liquid
//! **surface height** on those cells, and the **terrain** underneath. This prints all three over one
//! neighbourhood so the geometry can be read instead of guessed:
//!
//! - the **block census** — one line per MCLQ block: kind, wet cells, surface-height span, depth-byte
//!   span. Where a step would be *authored*, this is where it shows: two blocks over one chunk, or a
//!   block whose own plane has relief;
//! - the **overlap** scan — cells claimed by two blocks at once, which would composite the
//!   translucent water twice;
//! - the **seam** scan — every pair of adjacent wet cells whose planes disagree, so an authored step
//!   can be told apart from a rendered one before anyone opens the renderer;
//! - the **lattice-vs-waterline** scan — dry cells the ground still runs under. Whole wet cells are
//!   the only thing the renderer draws, so wherever the lattice runs out before the ground climbs
//!   through the plane, the water ends on a 4.167-yd straight edge in open water: a shape no
//!   shoreline has;
//! - its **mirror** — wet cells the ground climbs out of, which is the skirt of liquid-lattice
//!   geometry that lies over dry sand. Nothing renders there only because the terrain drew first
//!   and won the depth test, so this is the exact budget a depth bias spends: a decal pulled `b`
//!   yards toward the eye paints `b / slope` yards of that skirt;
//! - the **shoreline slope** at the pin, and what a coplanarity *lift* costs there. A decal held `l`
//!   yards above the water plane keeps painting for `l / slope` yards past the waterline, on dry
//!   ground — the arithmetic behind B348's foam-on-the-sand, and the reason that settle is a depth
//!   bias now and not a lift.
//!
//! Output is Blizzard data — pipe it to the scratchpad, never into the repo.
