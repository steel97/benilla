//! **How big is one tuft, and how much DEPTH does it span?** — the geometry half of the
//! "why does the fade cut leaf-by-leaf instead of pixel-by-pixel" question.
//!
//! `cargo run -p benilla-formats --example clutter_size`
//!
//! The fade boundary is a **plane** at a fixed view depth (the reference texgens camera-space Z).
//! Whether that plane *slices* a tuft — some of it drawn, the rest gone, a per-pixel cut — or
//! passes it by in a single frame depends on how much view depth one tuft occupies. A tuft that
//! spans 1 yd of depth is sliced for as long as it takes the player to walk 1 yd. A tuft that
//! spans 5 cm is, for practical purposes, either wholly in or wholly out: it pops.
//!
//! So this prints, per detail model: the world-space bounding box, the tuft's **depth span at the
//! worst yaw** (its horizontal diagonal — the widest it can present to the camera), and the
//! screen-space size that implies at the 61.11 yd cutout crossing.
