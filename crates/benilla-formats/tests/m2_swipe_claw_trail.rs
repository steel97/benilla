//! The druid's Swipe leaves no claw trail (decision 2282) — and, like the lava bubbles next door,
//! the asset says why in one number: **this model's whole visible existence is its texture
//! transform.**
//!
//! `Spells\SwipeCaster.m2` — Swipe's `cast` kit (`SpellVisual` 189 → kit 182 →
//! `SpellVisualEffectName` 215) — is two 51-vertex strips, three per batch, each rigidly skinned to
//! one bone that sweeps it through the arc. Their UVs are authored `u ∈ [0.945, 1.944]` against a
//! sheet the file addresses **CLAMP**, whose border texels are fully transparent. At the
//! translation track's first key the strips therefore sample the sheet's transparent right edge
//! along their whole length and draw *nothing at all*; the 1.5 s U-scroll is what drags the claw
//! across them.
//!
//! So a consumer that renders this model's geometry, rig, alpha loops and particles but not its
//! texture transform renders a correct-looking blood spray and no trail — which is exactly what
//! benilla's spell-effect lane did, on 0271's recorded premise that "no effect model in the
//! current corpus needs it". This file pins the three facts that make that premise false, so the
//! effect lane's UV channel can never be quietly dropped again.
//!
//! Skips (passes) when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
