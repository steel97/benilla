//! The birds that blink out when you turn the camera (decision 1259).
//!
//! `World\critter\birds\Bird01.m2` is the model that separates a **bind-pose** bound from an
//! **all-animation** one. Its geometry is a single 1.2 × 1.8 × 0.23 yd bird, modelled once at the
//! origin — and its only sequence keys bone 0 with a translation track that flies that bird 64 yd
//! along X and 17 yd along Y, a slow circuit over the treetops. A placed doodad's submesh entity
//! keeps its transform at the placement origin and lets the joint palette move the vertices, so a
//! bound derived from the bind-pose mesh describes a 1-yd box the bird has long since left: turn the
//! camera until that box exits the frustum and the bird vanishes while still on screen.
//!
//! The authored header box is the fix's source, and this pins that it really is the animated extent
//! — off the shipped file, so the premise can't rot. What consumes it (`m2_anim_bound` → the
//! per-submesh `Aabb` of an animated placement) is pinned by `benilla-world`'s own unit tests.
//!
//! Skips (passes) when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
