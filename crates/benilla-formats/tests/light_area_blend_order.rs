//! **The water swatch rides the area blend, and the blend applies spheres farthest-first.**
//!
//! Two halves of one law, byte-VERIFIED in wow-re (`system/lighting/scratch/ctb.md` §`0x6d2d00`
//! + `scratch/merge.md`, the latter's drain reading corrected by an emulator difftest oracle):
//!
//! 1. `dn_light_select 0x6d2d00` pushes every `Light.dbc` row with `dist ≤ outer` into a **max-heap
//!    keyed on DISTANCE** and drains it root-first — so the farthest light merges first and the
//!    **nearest lands last and dominates**. A point inside the tightest sphere's inner radius
//!    therefore resolves that sphere's `LightParams` **exactly**, whatever else overlaps it.
//! 2. `dn_record_overblend 0x6d30e0` merges **all 18 colour slots** of the gather record per light —
//!    its step-9 loop `+0x34..+0x40` is precisely IntBand rows 14–17, the ocean/river swatch. The
//!    water tint is an ordinary band; the client has no single-sphere pick anywhere in that path.
//!
//! Both were wrong before decision 1104, and the two errors hid each other. Ordering by blend
//! *weight* let a wide distant sphere land last and dilute a zone that fully contained the camera —
//! which made the blended water read muddy, which is what the `pick_light` water split was
//! introduced to dodge. The split then made the tint **discontinuous**: `pick_light` switches at a
//! tighter sphere's *outer* radius, exactly where that sphere's own weight is still zero, so the
//! Tirisfal→Silverpine border snapped green water to near-black brown in a single step (the
//! director's report) while ambient, sun and fog crossed it without a flicker.
