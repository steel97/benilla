//! Every book in the world opened and closed constantly (`#bugs` B36) — because the loader-idle
//! seed armed the model's **file-order-first** sequence, and on a book that sequence is the *Close
//! motion*, not the closed pose.
//!
//! `G_BookOpenMediumBrown.m2` is the model that makes this unmissable. Its four sequences are the
//! whole door family — Close(146) / Closed(147) / Open(148) / Opened(149) — authored in **that**
//! order, so file-order-0 is a 0.333 s motion that sweeps bone 0 from the open angle to the closed
//! one. Every one of the four carries `flags` bit 0 clear, i.e. the kernel loops it forever (wow-re
//! `gameobject-anim-arm.md` §3, `0x714585`). Looping the Close motion is therefore a book that snaps
//! open and swings shut three times a second, for ever — exactly what was reported.
//!
//! The reference arms **animation id 0 (Stand)** resolved through the model's own
//! `playableAnimationLookup` (§1, byte-verified `0x71019b`), and this book's table sends id 0 to
//! **147 Closed** — a two-key band whose keys are both identity, i.e. a still, shut book.
//!
//! The DuelingFlag test next door pins the same seed law on a model whose first sequence is a
//! *Spawn*; this one pins it where the wrong pick is a **motion**, which is the visually loudest
//! failure and the one a whole class of GameObjects (every `World\Goober\` door-family prop) shares.
//! Skips (passes) when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
