//! Pins the camera's **swim** framing-pivot preset against real build-5875 assets — the third
//! sibling of `selection_ring_radius` and `chat_bubble_anchor_height`, reading the same
//! `M2Sequence` `CAaBox` those two read, on a second animation.
//!
//! The reference keeps three framing-pivot presets and picks one per frame at `0x50f880`:
//!
//! ```text
//! swimming (MOVEFLAG 0x200000) -> cam+0x124        ; the swim preset
//! else cam+0x198 < 1.8315      -> cam+0x11c        ; zoomed in    -- NOT BUILT
//! else                            cam+0x120        ; zoomed out   -- NOT BUILT
//! ```
//!
//! All three are rebuilt from the model by `0x50ca90` off one shared base — the
//! `attach17.z + 0.0972` neck height — and only `+0x124` is then pulled down:
//!
//! ```text
//! 50cccf  call 0x711a20(model, seq=0)     ; Stand
//! 50ccde  call 0x711a20(model, seq=0x2a)  ; Swim (42)
//! 50ccf6  fsubr [esi+0x124]               ; +0x124 -= S * (Stand.max.z - Swim.max.z)
//! ```
//!
//! byte-decoded and VERIFIED in wow-re `ui/scratch/water-band-discontinuity.md` §7, which measured
//! the shipped Human Male at scale 1 as `+0x11c = +0x120 = 1.9002692` and `+0x124 = 1.5120120`.
//! That pair — and only that pair — is a number read off the binary; everything else below is
//! measured off the shipped M2s, pinned so the id-42 lookup cannot quietly stop resolving.
//!
//! The Human Male standing side comes out 1.900247 here rather than 1.9002692 because benilla
//! ships the base constant as `0.0972` while the reference's `[0x808ab0]` is `0.0972222` — 0.02 mm,
//! and *not* part of this feature, which is why the presets get a 1e-4 window and the drop itself
//! (a pure box difference, no constant in it) gets 1e-5.
//!
//! Skips when the gitignored client data isn't present.
