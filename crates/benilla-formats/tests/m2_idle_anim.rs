//! Animation-keyframe regression test against real vanilla creatures (decision 0019).
//!
//! Guards the bug that froze most creatures in Milestone B: a per-sequence keyframe window pulled in a
//! keyframe from a *later* sequence (14–64 s away), which inflated the Bevy clip's duration and made
//! the whole animation crawl. We now select keys by absolute timestamp within each sequence's band, so
//! every keyframe of every sequence must land inside `[0, duration]`. Skips when the client isn't present.
