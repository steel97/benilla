//! M2 anim-event regression test against real vanilla creatures (decision 0070 slice 3).
//!
//! Guards the event-track parse (events @MD20 0x114, stride 44, timestamps on the global
//! sequence timeline — byte-verified on DireWolf.m2): every event key must land inside its
//! sequence's `[0, duration]` window after the rebase, footstep tags must exist on walking
//! creatures, and the identifier bytes must be forward-stored printable `$xxx` tags (a reversed
//! read would produce `xxx$`). Skips when the client isn't present.
