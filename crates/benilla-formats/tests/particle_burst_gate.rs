//! The **burst gate**, pinned against a shipped asset whose gate never opens.
//!
//! A burst emitter fires on the rising edge of `enabled != 0 && sampledRate > 0`, both tracks
//! sampled from the same clock in the same frame (wow-re `part-emission-burst-flag.md` §1,
//! `0x718ed2`–`0x718ef6`). `Spells\Strike_Impact_Chest.m2` — the gold flare every warrior ability
//! impact plays (kit 437 → `SpellVisualEffectName` 416, attached at the target's chest `0x22`) —
//! carries two burst emitters, and **only one of them ever emits**:
//!
//! - #0 (`WEAPON\FLARE.BLP`): the enabled track steps `1 → 0` at the exact keyframe the rate track
//!   steps `0 → 50`. The two conditions are never true together, so it fires nothing, ever.
//! - #1 (`FirePlume64.blp`): gate held ON by a single key, rate `0 → 30 → 0`. It fires once.
//!
//! This is here because the *instrument* got it wrong first: the `m2part` dump derived a burst
//! count from `peak_rate()` alone and reported "burst of ~50 particles" for #0, which put a
//! diagnosis of "our impact bursts are too big" 2.7x over on particle count before anyone noticed.
//! An emitter that never fires is a real shipped shape, not a parse failure, and the reader must
//! be able to see the difference.
//!
//! Skips (passes) when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
