//! Pins the selection-ring radius against the **pixel-measured reference** on real build-5875 assets.
//!
//! The reference client sizes a **living unit's** ground selection ring (draw `0x608e00`, sizer
//! `0x60aee0`) as:
//!
//! ```text
//! ring_radius = OBJECT_FIELD_SCALE_X × sqrt( 0.5 · sqrt(dx² + dy²) )
//! ```
//!
//! where `dx,dy` are the horizontal (X,Y) extents of the unit's **Stand** animation bounding box (the M2
//! `M2Sequence` CAaBox), Stand being animation **id 0** via `animationLookup[0]`. This was byte-traced
//! *and* Unicorn-emulated in wow-re (`system/object-layer/scratch/selection-ring-scale.md`) and
//! reproduces the reference apitrace's measured ring radii to ~1 mm. It is NOT the render bounding sphere
//! (`0xCC`) — that (`0x5d6fe0`, `[unit+0x2b0]`) is the *corpse* decal; the render sphere over-sized tall
//! humans and under-sized the squat chicken because it folds in height, whereas the nested-sqrt footprint
//! compresses range.
//!
//! [`M2Bounds::ring_footprint`] is the model-local (pre-scale) part; the world radius is it ×
//! `OBJECT_FIELD_SCALE_X`. The four creatures below were the ones captured in the reference trace, drawn
//! life-size (scale ≈ 1.0), so `ring_footprint` ≈ the measured world radius. Skips when the gitignored
//! client data isn't present.
