//! The ammo crate the director looted was **stuck open/closing** — the lid springing to 75° and
//! swinging shut, ~1.5 times a second, for ever (decision 1151). The model is why the symptom is
//! that loud, and why "hold the motion's last frame" was never enough on its own.
//!
//! `G_Crate01.m2` is the door family, textbook: **bone 8** is the lid, and the four sequences are
//! Open(148) 0° → 75°, Opened(149) holding 75°, Close(146) 75° → 0°, Closed(147) holding 0°. Every
//! one of them carries `flags` bit 0 **clear**, i.e. the kernel wraps its band for ever (wow-re
//! `gameobject-anim-arm.md` §3, `0x714585`) — so the loop bit says nothing about how long a
//! transition lasts, and a consumer that reads it as "should this clip repeat?" arms the Close
//! sweep on an endless loop the moment the loot window closes.
//!
//! What ends a swing in the real client is the **object layer**: the completion callback fires once
//! at the arm's baked window (span × replay `R`, the loop bit ignored) and slot 14 `0x5f4120`
//! advances substate 4 Close → 1 Closed (§2d). This file pins the asset facts that law rests on —
//! the loop bits, `R = 1`, and that Close's last frame *is* the Closed pose — so the fix can't be
//! undone by "the clip says it loops".
//!
//! The `G_BookOpenMediumBrown` test next door pins the seed law on the same family; this one pins
//! the **transition** law. Skips (passes) when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
