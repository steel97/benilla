//! **FixColorVertexAlpha** — the bright-doorway portal fade, pinned to the reference's own live
//! capture (wow-re `trace-forensics-abbey-interior-d3d.md` §2) and to the building the fade is
//! load-bearing for (Dire Maul's entrance corridors).
//!
//! The capture is an unusually exact oracle. It read the abbey's uploaded MOCV vertex buffers back
//! off the D3D stream and diffed them against the file: **678/678 vertices byte-identical in group 1,
//! 496/506 in group 3** — the fade is the whole difference, and it is exactly 10 vertices, all at the
//! one portal whose far side is an EXTERIOR group, all hard-set to `(255,255,255,255)`. Interior↔
//! interior portals whiten nothing, "including vertices AT portal corners".
//!
//! That single pair of counts pins every part of the mechanism at once — the exterior-neighbour gate,
//! the containment half of the distance kernel (an infinite-plane test whitens 12 here, not 10), and
//! the absence of the MOPY alpha pre-pass (which would rewrite 372 of group 3's alphas and blow the
//! "byte-identical" finding apart). Skips when the client isn't present.
