//! **The last chunk clamps to EOF.** A WMO's chunk stream is not guaranteed to tile its file
//! exactly, and the reference tolerates the slop: its walk "reads chunks while the 8-byte header is
//! in-bounds and clamps the last chunk to EOF (never requires exact tiling)" — wow-re `models.md`,
//! "WMO chunk-structure contract" (VERIFIED, with a 6332-file corpus oracle), whose own worked
//! example is the single file in the game that needs the rule: `Undercity_144.wmo`'s MOGP declares
//! one byte more than the file holds.
//!
//! We used to `break` there and hand the caller nothing. That cost g144 its whole MOGP — flags,
//! portal-ref span, area id, fog, doodad and light refs — and since the portal flood reaches a
//! neighbour only through a group's ref span, the group became a **dead end**: g144 is the short
//! corridor joining g95 and g152, so the rooms past it culled from either side and you saw sky
//! through the doorway (B26, decision 0972).
//!
//! Two oracles, because the bug had two halves. The corpus sweep is the one that generalises: it is
//! the same shape as the reference's own "0 rejected" oracle, and it fails for a *new* file as well
//! as for this one. The byte pins on g144 catch a clamp that silently returns the wrong slice.
//! Skips when the client isn't present.
