//! The cold-breath puff, pinned against the shipped assets (`#bugs` B233, decision 1149).
//!
//! B233 was reported as a **player character in Dun Morogh** with no visible breath, and the fix
//! rests on three asset facts that a mechanism note alone cannot establish — the trap decision
//! 0705 names, where a verified mechanism turns out not to *apply* to the thing in front of you:
//!
//! 1. the trigger exists on the reported model — `HumanMale.m2` authors a **`$BTH` event on
//!    animation id 0 (Stand)**, so an idle player fires one every loop with no timer of ours;
//! 2. the attach tag the client passes, **`0x11` = AttachmentID 17**, resolves on that model to a
//!    bone at the **mouth**, not the base — the difference between vapour at the face and a cloud
//!    at the feet;
//! 3. the asset the DBC names is a **one-shot emitter**, so the client's end-of-clip terminator is
//!    the right lifetime for it (`FxStage::OneShot`, as the mount poof uses).
//!
//! Skips (passes) when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
