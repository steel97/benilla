//! The BRM lava bubbles' animation is frozen (bug B98, decision 1408) — and the asset says why in
//! one number: **every one of this model's animated channels is keyed inside file sequence slot 1,
//! and slot 1 is a 50 %-weighted variation of animation id 0.**
//!
//! `BlackrockStatueLavaBubble.m2` is placed 15 times inside `Blackrock.wmo`. It authors two
//! sequences, both animation id 0 with frequencies 16384/16383 — so the reference re-rolls between
//! them every play-window (wow-re `doodad-anim-host.md` §5, decision 0768) and two placements are
//! on different slots at the same instant. Slot 0 is a dead hold: its bone-scale window is two
//! identity keys and its texture-transform window is two zero keys. Slot 1 is the whole animation:
//! the bubbles swell 1.0 → 2.785 while the sprite's V offset flips by 0.605.
//!
//! benilla baked the UV loop against slot 0 and only slot 0, through a registry keyed by MATERIAL —
//! shared by every instance of the batch, so there is no sequence to key on. On this model that
//! bakes to `None`: no registration, no table row, no scroll, on every placement, for ever. This
//! file pins both halves of that — the dead slot 0 and the live slot 1 — so the per-sequence set
//! can never silently collapse back to one loop.
//!
//! Skips (passes) when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
