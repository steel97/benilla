//! **A map with no `Light.dbc` row of its own falls back to record ID 1, not to an invention.**
//!
//! `Light.dbc` carries rows for 26 map ids; **Deeprun Tram (369) has none** — not even the
//! falloff-0 `(0,0,0)` global that maps 0/1 carry. The client handles that in
//! `dn_light_array_build 0x6d6170`: the per-map filter (`0x6d61a9 cmp [row+4], mapId`) matches
//! nothing, and the tail (`0x6d62b2`–`0x6d62c9`) writes `idMap[1]` — the record whose **ID column**
//! is 1, not row-index 1 — into slot 0. `dn_light_select 0x6d2d00` then no-ops (count ≤ 1 ⇒ empty
//! blend heap) and the colour table commits that record whole. (wow-re
//! `system/lighting/scratch/no-light-row-fallback.md`.)
//!
//! Row 1 is the Azeroth global → LightParams **12**, whose bands are an ordinary six-key day curve.
//! Before this was wired, benilla substituted a hardcoded bright noon (fog `[140,183,234]` at
//! 1000 yd) and the Tram's undersea stretch rendered as a daylight scene against the reference's
//! deep blue. The numbers below are read straight off the shipped DBC — LightParams 12 → int bands
//! 199..216 (sub-0 diffuse, sub-1 ambient, sub-7 fog) and float bands 67..72 (sub-0 fog end in
//! inches, sub-1 start fraction) — so they pin the *identity of the record*, which is the part that
//! was wrong.
