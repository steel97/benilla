//! The loader-idle seed is **Stand**, not the file-order-first sequence (the floating duel-flag
//! bug, 2026-07-25 — decision 0637).
//!
//! `DuelingFlag.m2` is the model that separates the two readings. Its sequence table is authored
//! **Spawn(145) / Stand(0) / Despawn(157)** — file order 0 is the *Spawn*, not the idle — and its
//! geometry is modelled in the air: the bind pose sits at z ≈ +8.9…+14.7, and bone 0's translation
//! track is what plants it (`t=700 → −9.124`, held to `t=5333`). So arming file-order-0 and looping
//! it flies the flag 9 yards up every 3.3 s, while arming Stand holds it planted — which is what
//! the reference does (wow-re `gameobject-anim-arm.md` §1, byte-verified `0x71019b`: the loader
//! arms animation id 0 resolved through the model's own `playableAnimationLookup`).
//!
//! This test pins the three facts the fix rests on, straight off the shipped file. Skips (passes)
//! when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
