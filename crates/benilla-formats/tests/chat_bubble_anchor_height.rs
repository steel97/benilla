//! Pins the **chat bubble's** anchor height against real build-5875 assets — the sibling of
//! `selection_ring_radius`, reading the same Stand-animation box on the other axis.
//!
//! The reference anchors the bubble at
//!
//! ```text
//! worldZ = unit.z + (StandBox.max.z − StandBox.min.z) × modelScale + 0.7
//! ```
//!
//! where the extent comes from `0x4b0e38 call 0x711a20` — which wow-re's anchor cross-check
//! (2026-08-17) followed into the model layer and found reading the **MD20 header image**: file
//! bytes, no bone matrix anywhere in the call tree, returning that CAaBox's Z. The scaled product
//! is latched at `bubble+0x354` behind a parity guard, so it is queried once per chat line.
//!
//! Benilla shipped the bubble on the **posed PlayerName attachment** instead (the `0x608640`
//! chain), on a recorded INFERRED claim that the two calls were equivalent — "both the head-region
//! attachment height, model-scaled". They are not: they differ precisely on animated-vs-static.
//! This test exists so that claim cannot come back by accident, and so the two heights stay
//! distinguishable — they are close enough (2.01 vs 2.21 on a human male) that an eye cannot tell
//! them apart on a human (2.01 vs 2.21) — which is exactly how the wrong one shipped. On a chicken
//! they are not close at all (0.44 vs 0.81): Blizzard floats the *name* anchor well clear of a small
//! model's head, while the bubble hugs the model. That spread is why the pair is pinned per model
//! rather than as a single fudge factor. Decision 1406.
//!
//! Skips when the gitignored client data isn't present.
