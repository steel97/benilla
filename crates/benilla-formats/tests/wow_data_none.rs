//! `WOW_DATA=` — set and empty — means **there is no install**, through the real env read.
//!
//! The ladder's own logic is unit-tested purely against `candidates_from`; this covers the wiring,
//! which is the half a pure test cannot see. It is its own file for the reason the sibling
//! `wow_data_env.rs` explains: setting `$WOW_DATA` is process-global, every test in the workspace
//! now resolves its install through that one read, and cargo gives each integration-test file its
//! own process — so one mutating test per file can only reach itself.
//!
//! What it protects (decision 1451): a dev build on a machine with an install cannot otherwise
//! reach the no-install boot path, so nothing exercised it and it rotted into a frame-one panic.
//! This spelling is what `scripts/gates.sh` runs the engine enforcer under.
