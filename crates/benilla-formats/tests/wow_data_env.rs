//! `$WOW_DATA` still wins — the one env read in [`benilla_formats::wow_data`], covered.
//!
//! **Why this is an integration test and not a unit test** (decision 1175): setting `$WOW_DATA` is
//! process-global, and since the sweep every test in the workspace resolves its install through
//! that one read. A unit test that mutates it poisons whatever else is running in the same test
//! binary, and the victim moves around with the thread scheduling — which is exactly what happened
//! before this was pulled out. Cargo gives each integration-test file its own process, and this
//! file holds one test, so the mutation can only reach itself.
//!
//! The ladder itself is unit-tested purely, against `candidates_from`.
