//! UBRS's Rookery Eggs "don't play their animation when you walk close" (bug B140, decision 1404).
//!
//! The egg is `gameobject_template` 175124, a **TRAP** with radius 3 and one charge: walk inside it
//! and vmangos spends the charge, casts the whelp-spawner, and — because the spawn rows carry
//! `animprogress = 100` — sends `SMSG_GAMEOBJECT_DESPAWN_ANIM` (`GameObject.cpp:654-656` →
//! `WorldObject::SendObjectDeSpawnAnim`) immediately followed by `SMSG_DESTROY_OBJECT`. The real
//! client arms substate 12 off that packet (wow-re `gameobject-anim-arm.md` §2c: code table
//! `0x80b0e0[6]` = 12, LUT `0x8607e4[12]` = **157 Despawn**) and *pins* the object so the destroy
//! waits for the play (`go-display-sound-events.md` §6d).
//!
//! This file pins the two asset facts that whole law rests on, because both are the kind of thing a
//! plausible reading gets wrong:
//!
//! 1. **The hatch is 157 Despawn, and it is unreachable from the §243 state machine.** The model
//!    authors the door family (146..149) too — so a reader that only ever consults
//!    `GAMEOBJECT_STATE` finds sequences, arms one, and looks correct while never playing the
//!    animation anyone reported. Substate 1 (`state = 1`, `animprogress = 100`) resolves to 147
//!    Closed, a 0.333 s near-static hold; the hatch is eight times longer and lives on the other,
//!    disjoint arm channel.
//! 2. **The window the pin has to outlast is real time.** 157 is ~2.667 s — the entire visible
//!    event happens *after* the server has told the client the object is gone, which is why a
//!    client without the pin shows nothing at all rather than something clipped.
//!
//! Skips (passes) when the client isn't present at `<repo>/WoW/Data`.
