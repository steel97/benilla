//! `CinematicSequences.dbc` + `CinematicCamera.dbc` — the in-engine cinematic fly-bys, and the
//! world-space camera path each one resolves to.
//!
//! A cinematic in 1.12 is **not** a movie file. `SMSG_TRIGGER_CINEMATIC` carries a
//! `CinematicSequences.dbc` id; the row names up to eight `CinematicCamera.dbc` cameras; each of
//! those names a `Cameras\*.m2` whose single [`M2Camera`](benilla_m2::M2Camera) record *is* the
//! shot — an eye path, a look-at path and a roll, keyed over a timeline in the model's own local
//! frame — plus the world origin and facing to plant that frame at. The client flies its view
//! along it and the world renders normally underneath. (The pre-rendered `.avi` under
//! `Data\<locale>\Interface\Cinematics` is the *other* thing, the opening movie; it is not this.)
//!
//! **The shipped tables, dumped 2026-08-29 (VERIFIED — the bytes, not a wiki):**
//! `CinematicSequences.dbc` is `10 × 10 fields × 40 B`: `ID · soundId · camera[8]`. Every shipped
//! row uses exactly **one** camera and authors `soundId = 0`. `CinematicCamera.dbc` is
//! `10 × 7 × 28 B`: `ID · model (string) · soundId · originX · originY · originZ · originFacing`.
//! The model column ships `.mdx`; the archive file is `.m2` ([`camera_model_path`]). The ten rows
//! are the eight race intros plus `PalantirOfAzora` and `Scry_cam`. Facing is **radians** — the
//! shipped values include `3.14159` and `4.71239` (π and 3π/2) to five decimals, which no degree
//! table would.
//!
//! **The world transform** — `world = origin + Rz(facing)·local`, `z` straight through — is the
//! one non-obvious step, and it is checked against an independent oracle rather than assumed:
//! vmangos walks its own server-side copy of these paths (`Player::UpdateCinematic`) off a
//! hand-built `cinematic_waypoints` table of sampled world positions, and our evaluated path lands
//! on those samples (tens of yards over ~600-yard offsets, on a table whose z column is
//! ground-level, not camera-level). The three sign/axis alternatives miss by 700–1800 yards. See
//! [`CinematicPath::sample`].
//!
//! **The shipped corpus, read out of the ten `Cameras\*.m2` files** (`fov` radians, `d₀` = how far
//! the shot's first eye position sits from its own origin, horizontally):
//!
//! | cam | model | fov | length | pos keys | roll | d₀ |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | 1 | PalantirOfAzora | 0.7854 | 14.9 s | 10 | const 0 | 205 yd |
//! | 2 | FlybyUndead | **1.5708** | 102.0 s | 22 | 18 keys | 523 yd |
//! | 122 | FlybyNightElf | 0.7854 | 102.3 s | 32 | 19 keys | 813 yd |
//! | 142 | FlyByHuman | 0.7854 | 87.5 s | 20 | const 2π | 663 yd |
//! | 162 | FlyByGnome | 0.7854 | 76.7 s | 27 | const 0 | 705 yd |
//! | 182 | FlyByTroll | 0.7854 | 57.8 s | 21 | 12 keys | 39 yd |
//! | 202 | FlyByTauren | 0.7854 | 70.3 s | 19 | 7 keys | 1741 yd |
//! | 224 | Scry_cam | 0.7854 | 3.3 s | 1 | const 3π | 0 yd |
//! | 234 | FlyByDwarf | 0.7854 | 59.6 s | 28 | const 2π | 652 yd |
//! | 235 | FlybyOrc | 0.7854 | 70.2 s | 22 | 14 keys | 1100 yd |
//!
//! Three things there are load-bearing and none of them are guessable. **The Undead intro's FOV is
//! 90°, not 45°** — a client that hard-coded the other nine's value would render that one shot at
//! half the intended width. **Roll is authored around multiples of 2π rather than around 0**
//! (`FlyByDwarf` holds a constant `6.2832`; `Scry_cam` holds `3π`), so it is an *angle to apply*,
//! and a "roll is zero, skip it" shortcut happens to be right only by the identity `2π ≡ 0`; five
//! of the ten genuinely animate it. And the shots **start far from their own origin** — a Tauren
//! 1741 yards out — which is why the server re-anchors object visibility to the flying camera
//! while one runs (decision 0196), and why the client has to stream the world from the *camera*
//! and not the avatar for the duration.
//!
//! **What this module deliberately does not decide.** The authored `near`/`far` clip (`0.22222` /
//! `27.7778` = 8/36 and 1000/36, identical on all ten) are carried, not applied: a 27.8-yard far
//! plane would render the dwarf intro's mountains as empty sky, so whatever the reference does
//! with those two floats, it is not "install them as the world clips". Which camera of a
//! multi-camera row plays, what ends a shot, and how `fov` reaches the world projection are the
//! reference's to state (the wow-re cinematic dispatch, 2026-08-29).
