//! Creature display resolution: `displayId` → M2 model + skin textures + scale.
//!
//! An NPC's `UNIT_FIELD_DISPLAYID` indexes **CreatureDisplayInfo.dbc**, which gives a `ModelID`
//! (into **CreatureModelData.dbc**, the `.mdx` path), a per-display scale, and up to three skin
//! texture names. Creature M2s leave their `Monster1/2/3` texture slots blank and pull the skin
//! from these names — the texture lives **in the same directory as the model** (wowdev.wiki). The
//! effective render scale is `CreatureModelData.modelScale * CreatureDisplayInfo.creatureModelScale`.
//!
//! **Character-model NPCs.** A humanoid NPC (guard, questgiver, townsfolk) uses a `Character\…` body
//! M2 — the same model a player wears — but its appearance is *not* on the wire (as a player's is);
//! it lives in **CreatureDisplayInfoExtra.dbc**, reached via `CreatureDisplayInfo.ExtendedDisplayInfoID`
//! (0 for a plain beast). That row supplies race/sex + the customization selectors and, in field 18, a
//! **bake name** — a pre-composited body atlas the client ships under `Textures\BakedNpcTextures\` and
//! loads directly (rather than compositing live like the local player). We surface it as
//! [`NpcAppearance`]; the beast skin path ([`CreatureModel::textures`]) is untouched.
//!
//! Layouts verified against build 5875 (field counts from the file header, cross-checked with
//! wowdev.wiki + vmangos `DBCStructure.h`): CreatureModelData = 16 fields (ID@0, ModelName@2,
//! ModelScale@4, CollisionHeight@15); CreatureDisplayInfo = 12 fields (ID@0, ModelID@1, ExtendedDisplayInfoID@3, Scale@4,
//! TextureVariation@6/7/8); CreatureDisplayInfoExtra = 19 fields (ID@0, Race@1, Sex@2, Skin@3, Face@4,
//! HairStyle@5, HairColor@6, FacialHair@7, Equipment@8..17, BakeName@18).
