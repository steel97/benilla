//! `SkillLine.dbc` + `SkillLineAbility.dbc` loader — spell id → skill line → {name, icon}, the
//! spellbook's tab source (decision 0216 §8: "tabs = the class skill lines of known spells").
//!
//! Layout — VERIFIED against the **vmangos server source**
//! (`vmangos-src/src/game/Database/DBCStructure.h`'s `SkillLineEntry`/`SkillLineAbilityEntry`
//! structs + `DBCfmt.h`'s `SkillLinefmt`/`SkillLineAbilityfmt` format strings): vmangos parses
//! these two tables straight off the same build-5875 client data benilla reads, so its struct
//! layout — not an empirical guess, not even wow-re's own notes (none exist for these two tables,
//! grepped `system/dbc`) — is the strongest ground available, the same standing this codebase
//! already gives vmangos's wire handlers (decision 0216's own citations of `ItemHandler.cpp`/
//! `Player.cpp`).
//!
//! `SkillLine.dbc` — `SkillLinefmt = "nixssssssssxxxxxxxxxxi"` (22 fields, 88 B/record):
//! `id`(0, indexed) · `categoryId`(1, int32) · `skillCostID`(2, unused) · the 8-locale
//! `displayName_lang` block (3..10, enUS first ⇒ **NameEnUs = column 3**) + its flags word (11) ·
//! the 8-locale `description_lang` block (12..19; enUS **column 12** = the skills pane's
//! detail-pane body, `GetSkillLineInfo`'s 13th return) + its flags word (20) ·
//! **`spellIcon` = column 21** (a `SpellIcon.dbc` id — [`crate::dbc::load_spell_icon_map`], the
//! same table `spells.rs`'s action-bar catalog joins against).
//!
//! `SkillLineAbility.dbc` — `SkillLineAbilityfmt = "niiiixxiiiiixxi"` (15 fields, 60 B/record):
//! `id`(0, indexed) · **`skillId` = column 1** · **`spellId` = column 2** · `racemask`(3) ·
//! `classmask`(4) · `req_skill_value`(7; 5-6 unused: `racemaskNot`/`classmaskNot`, always 0 this
//! build) · `forward_spellid`(8) · `learnOnGetSkill`(9) · `max_value`(10) · `min_value`(11) ·
//! `reqtrainpoints`(14; 12-13 unused). Read into one [`SlaInfo`] per spell (a spell can carry
//! more than one row across race/class variants; the FIRST row wins, deterministic by file
//! order — [`SkillLineCatalog::spell_to_line`]'s long-standing convention), except
//! `forward_spellid`, which takes the first **non-zero** across the spell's rows to match
//! vmangos's own `SpellMgr::GetSpellBookSuccessorSpellId` exactly (identical on this build:
//! probed, 44 spells carry more than one row and not one disagrees on the column). `max_value`/
//! `min_value` are the recipe-difficulty trivial ranks (TrivialSkillLineRankHigh/Low): pinned on
//! the raw 5875 file this session — Bolt of Linen Cloth 2963 → (line 197, req 1, low 25,
//! high 50), Minor Healing Potion 2330 → (171, 1, 55, 95), which reproduces its known classic
//! orange 1 / yellow 55 / green 75 / gray 95 progression under the color law TU-C confirmed at
//! the bytes (decision 0446).
//!
//! `SkillRaceClassInfo.dbc` — `SkillRaceClassInfofmt = "diiiiiix"` (8 fields, 32 B/record):
//! `id`(0) · **`skillId` = column 1** · **`raceMask` = column 2** · **`classMask` = column 3** ·
//! **`flags` = column 4** · **`reqLevel` = column 5** · `skillTierId`(6) ·
//! **`skillCostID` = column 7**. This is
//! the table the client's spellbook tab classifier routes through (decision 0228): a spell's skill
//! line is looked up here for the player's race+class, and if the matching row's `flags` bit `0x80`
//! (`SKILL_FLAG_DISPLAY_SORTED`, cmangos `DBCEnums.h`) is set — or no row matches — the spell's tab
//! is **General** (key 0) instead of the line's own tab. Byte-verified: wow-re
//! `system/ui/scratch/spellbook-book-build.md` §3 (`0x6ddf90(skillLine, class, race) → variant`;
//! `(int8)[variant+0x10] < 0 → key 0`; `[variant+4]` = skillId, `[variant+0x10]` = flags — the
//! struct offsets confirm the column read). The `flags`/`raceMask`/`classMask` semantics follow
//! vmangos `DBCStructure.h`'s `SkillRaceClassInfoEntry`; the row-match (first row whose masks
//! admit the race/class) is the standard classic semantics, validated against the real build-5875
//! data by [`SkillLineCatalog::spell_tab`]'s tests.
//!
//! `SkillLineCategory.dbc` — byte-checked on the raw 5875 file (a struct-unpack dump: 8 records ×
//! 11 fields, 44 B/record): `id`(0) · the 8-locale `name` block (enUS ⇒ **column 1**) + flags(9) ·
//! **`displayOrder` = column 10** — the skills pane's header vocabulary and group order (decision
//! 0437 phase 4): Class Skills(7, order 2) · Professions(11, 3) · Secondary(9, 4) · Weapon(6, 5) ·
//! Armor(8, 6) · Languages(10, 7); `Attributes`(5, 1) never carries player rows, and
//! `Not Displayed`(12, 8) is a header like any other — **not** a hide bucket, whatever its name
//! suggests: the client drops `GENERIC (DND)` by its `SkillRaceClassInfo.flags & 0x2`, never by its
//! category (decision 1091). A skill line's own `categoryId` is `SkillLine.dbc` column 1 (the
//! `SkillLinefmt` layout above).
//!
//! Skill line ids are stable, well-known constants across the whole classic tool ecosystem
//! (vmangos `SharedDefines.h`'s `SkillType` enum, itself commented "Data from SpellLine.dbc (1.12.1
//! checked)") — Frost=6, Fire=8, … — cross-checked directly by this module's own real-data tests.
