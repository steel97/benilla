//! Vanilla (build 5875 / MD20 v256) M2 **particle emitter** parsing — read straight from raw bytes.
//!
//! `benilla-m2` parses only the render path and deliberately skips the cosmetic chunks, so the
//! particle emitters are read here. The post-vanilla `M2ParticleEmitter` (with `texture_file_data_ids`,
//! `enable_encryption`, WoD flag bits) does not match 1.12; the vanilla layout is a fixed
//! **0x1f8-byte** record. The byte layout is from `wow-5875-re` (`FUN_0070ebd0` @ `0x70ebd0`,
//! `m2-decomp.c`) and **difftested** here against `ElwynnCampfire.m2` (see `tests/`):

//!
//! The two keyed tracks here (emission rate, enabled) bake **one loop per sequence** into
//! [`EmitTiming`] through the same FN1 kernel as the material alpha (`models::key_anim`,
//! decision 0641): the reference samples both per frame through the *playing* sequence's own key
//! window (`0x713d50` — wow-re `part-emission-rate-animated.md` §2/§3), so what an emitter does
//! is a function of which sequence its model instance is playing. A quest GameObject authors its
//! explosion inside one-shot clips and an OFF window in every idle sequence; baking only
//! sequence 0's band parked that choreography at its end value forever (bug B27).
//!
//! The record tail (+0x180..) is the wow-re `part-simspace-fields.md` §5-verified map (their
//! `ac915a7d`): the loader `0x70ebd0` remaps file+0x188/+0x18c → runtime twinkleScale min/max
//! (delta = max − min at rt+0x1c0), NOT a size multiplier — see [`ParticleEmitterDef::twinkle`].
