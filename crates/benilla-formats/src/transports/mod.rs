//! `MO_TRANSPORT` timetable builder + cycle sampler (decision 0438 phase 0) — pure math, no Bevy,
//! **WoW coordinates throughout** (the Bevy transform is the consumer's job).
//!
//! This transcribes the structural skeleton of vmangos's own transport-path builder and mover:
//! - `TransportMgr::GenerateWaypoints` (`/Users/sam/wre/vmangos-src/src/game/Transports/
//!   TransportMgr.cpp:105-334`) — the keyframe list, the map-change/teleport skip dance, the
//!   per-leg Catmull-Rom splines, the `DistSinceStop`/`DistUntilStop` modular walks, the
//!   four-regime `TimeTo` trapezoid, and the `ArriveTime`/`DepartureTime` accumulation.
//! - `ShipTransport::Update` + `CalculateSegmentPos` (`.../Transport.cpp:283-380`) — the
//!   stateless "where on the path is `progress % period`" query, [`TransportTimetable::sample`].
//! - The spline machinery (`.../Movement/spline/spline.cpp`): `s_catmullRomCoeffs` (:61-65) is
//!   transcribed as closed-form blending polynomials in [`catmull_rom_weights`] /
//!   [`catmull_rom_deriv_weights`] (verified by hand-expanding the `Vector4 * Matrix4` row-vector
//!   product — standard Catmull-Rom basis functions, tau = 0.5); `SegLengthCatmullRom` (:159-177,
//!   `STEPS_PER_SEGMENT` chord samples) is [`Leg::seg_length`]; `InitCatmullRom`'s non-cyclic
//!   virtual endpoints (:238-268 — the **first** virtual point is `lerp(c0, c1, -1)`, i.e.
//!   `2·c0 − c1`; the **last** is a plain **duplicate** of the final real control, not
//!   extrapolated) are [`Leg::control`].
//!
//! **The whole-path orientation spline collapses to a closed form.** `GenerateWaypoints` builds a
//! second, separate Catmull-Rom spline over the *entire* raw path (with hand-computed virtual
//! endpoints, `TransportMgr.cpp:120-127`) purely to read `InitialOrientation` off
//! `evaluate_derivative(i, t=0)` for every kept node. Expanding `s_catmullRomCoeffs`' derivative
//! weights at `t=0` gives `[-0.5, 0, 0.5, 0]` — only the two *interior* control points survive (the
//! virtual endpoints' weight is always zero at `t=0`, and are in fact never even reached within the
//! nodes this loop visits). So `InitialOrientation(i) = atan2(path[i+1].y − path[i−1].y,
//! path[i+1].x − path[i−1].x) + π`, using the **raw, unfiltered** node array — no spline object
//! needed. See `orientation_at` below.
//!
//! **Timing-mode calibration is the point of this module.** vmangos's own computed periods do
//! **not** match the real client's — the server DB-overrides them (`transports` table,
//! `TransportMgr.cpp:63-79`, "load period override from db since our algorithm is not perfect").
//! The client's per-span arc-length time is transcribed bit-exact in `wow-5875-re`
//! (`crates/object-layer/src/taxi_spline.rs`: `arc_time_ms`, closed-form constant-acceleration
//! kinematics with `round_ftol` — ×1000, round-half-away-from-zero, truncate). [`TimeMode`] (private —
//! not public API) selects between vmangos's own f32-seconds accumulation (`Mode::Vmangos`,
//! transcribing `TransportMgr.cpp:297-325` exactly) and a client-closed-form per-span accumulation
//! (`Mode::ClientForms`); the arc-length chord-sampling density (`STEPS_PER_SEGMENT` — vmangos uses
//! 3, its own comment notes "client's value is 20") is a second calibration knob. The `tests`
//! module builds all nine live transports under every (mode × steps) combination against the
//! server's actually-effective (DB-pinned) periods and reports a table — see decision 0438 phase 0.
//!
//! **The cycle length itself is past calibration:** [`TransportTimetable::build`] pins its period
//! to the real client's own bookkeeping, transcribed in [`crate::transport_period`] and gold-gated
//! bit-exact against all nine server-sniff values (the 2026-07-17 wow-re §5 verdict). The sample
//! table between the pins stays vmangos-mode (internally consistent windows + easing); porting the
//! client's true per-leg tick evaluation is the recorded follow-on.
