//! GMTicketCategory.dbc — the ten trouble-ticket categories the Help window's "page a GM" list is
//! built from, and the id each one submits as (decision 1673).
//!
//! This table is the answer to a question the shipped FrameXML makes look unanswerable. Its
//! `HelpFrameGM_UpdateCategories(GetGMTicketCategories())` consumes the binding's varargs as
//! `(key, text)` PAIRS, and `HELPFRAME_FRAMES`/`GENERAL_HELPFRAME` are keyed `1..10` with ten
//! distinct titles — yet `GlobalStrings.lua` ships only `TICKET_TYPE1..4` ("Game Play",
//! "Harassment", "Stuck", "Bug"). Those four are not this list: they feed the OpenTicket
//! *dropdown*, which has no frame in 1.12 and whose `OnShow` call is commented out. The category
//! list is DBC data, and it lines up with `GENERAL_HELPFRAME`'s keys row for row:
//!
//! | id | name |
//! |---|---|
//! | 1 | Stuck |
//! | 2 | Behavior/Harassment |
//! | 3 | Guild |
//! | 4 | Item |
//! | 5 | Environmental |
//! | 6 | Non-Quest/Creep |
//! | 7 | Quest/Quest NPC |
//! | 8 | Technical |
//! | 9 | Account/Billing |
//! | 10 | Character |
//!
//! **benilla's own Help window no longer shows this list** (decision 1687): it goes straight from
//! Home to the ticket box and files under 0, "uncategorised". The catalog still ships, because
//! `GetGMTicketCategories()` is a real Era binding a third-party addon may call and because these
//! ids are still what the *server* names a ticket by — an existing ticket's category arrives on
//! `UPDATE_TICKET` and is echoed back on an edit.
//!
//! **The id is the wire value**, not just a list index: the clicked button stores it as
//! `HelpFrameOpenTicket.ticketType`, and that is what `NewGMTicket(category, text)` puts in
//! `CMSG_GMTICKET_CREATE`'s category field. So a catalog that renumbered on load would file every
//! ticket under the wrong heading, silently — which is why this is an ordered id-keyed read of the
//! file rather than a `Vec` indexed from zero.
//!
//! Record layout (10 rows in the shipped 5875 file, verified by loading it): `ID@0`,
//! `Name_Lang@1..8`, `NameFlags@9` — the same 8-locale + mask shape as [`crate::itembagfamily`].
//! Ids are 1..10 contiguous here, but nothing downstream may assume that: the ordered pairs are
//! what the binding pushes, and the id is what the wire carries.
