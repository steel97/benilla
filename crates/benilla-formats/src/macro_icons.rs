//! The **macro icon chooser's catalog** — the list `GetNumMacroIcons`/`GetMacroIconInfo` serve.
//!
//! Byte-derived from the reference client's `BuildMacroIconList` (`0x4f0090`); the full RE note is
//! `wow-5875-re` `system/ui/scratch/macro-icon-chooser.md`. The headline: **the chooser does not
//! read `SpellIcon.dbc`**. It enumerates the files that actually exist under `Interface\Icons\`.

/// The directory the chooser enumerates — and, at `GetMacroIconInfo`, the prefix it splices back on
/// (`0x84c988`, spliced by `SStrPrintf("%s%s", …)` at `0x4f1a8d`). 16 characters, which is the
/// literal count the client strips when it stores an entry.
const ICON_DIR: &str = "Interface\\Icons\\";

/// The **macro icon chooser** list — every `Interface\Icons\` file whose name begins `Spell_` or
/// `Ability_`, case-insensitively sorted and deduplicated, each as a full texture path.
///
/// This is the *enumeration*, not a DBC scan, because that is what the client does
/// (`BuildMacroIconList 0x4f0090`). It unions three sources: the `(listfile)` of every open
/// `patch*.MPQ` plus `interface.MPQ` (name-table index 6, `0x82e12c`), read via `0x648fb0`; a disk
/// scan of `SFileGetBasePath() + "Interface\Icons\"`; and a CWD-relative `Interface\Icons\` scan.
/// We serve the archive half through [`Chain::list`] — a stock install has no loose `Interface\Icons`
/// directory, so sources 2 and 3 contribute nothing and are not implemented. (They are how the
/// reference lets a user drop a custom icon in; if we ever want that, it belongs here.)
///
/// Per entry the client keeps the name **after the 16-char prefix, with the extension stripped**,
/// accepting only a last-dot extension in `{.blp, .tga}` and rejecting directories. It then
/// `qsort`s case-insensitively (`0x4f0128`, comparator `0x4f05e0` = `SStrCmpI`) and adjacent-dedups
/// walking down (`0x4f0140`–`0x4f01a4`) — so the dedup key is the whole stored name, folded for
/// case, and `Foo.blp` beside `Foo.tga` collapses to one entry. **Sorted, not DBC row order**: the
/// order the player scrolls is alphabetical.
///
/// We store the reassembled full path rather than the bare name. `GetMacroIconInfo` splices
/// [`ICON_DIR`] back on anyway, so what Lua sees is identical, and every consumer here (the popup's
/// `SetTexture`, `CreateMacro`'s saved texture) wants the whole path.
///
/// **Why this replaces a `SpellIcon.dbc` scan** (bug B221, decision 1053): the DBC names art that
/// does not ship. Five of its chooser-eligible rows have no file under any name (`Ability_Temp`,
/// `Spell_Holy_Invulnerable`, `Spell_Misc_Food_08`, `Spell_Orc_Omniscience`,
/// `Ability_Hunter_BeastSooth`), and two more are malformed for a texture lookup
/// (`Spells\Icon\Spell_Fire_Fire`, a different directory root; `Ability_Druid_Mangle.tga`, carrying
/// a literal extension) — so the picker showed solid white cells where those landed. Enumerating
/// the archive cannot produce a name with no file behind it: the defect class is gone by
/// construction, not by an allow-list. On a stock 5875 install this yields **517** icons (the RE
/// counts the same 517 off `patch.MPQ` 77 + `interface.MPQ` 443 = 520 raw, less 3 duplicate names).
