//! MCLQ liquid surfaces → per-chunk water meshes (Phase E; Phase 1 = inland water).
//!
//! Vanilla liquid is **MCLQ** — per-MCNK, a 9×9 absolute-height grid + an 8×8 cell-flag grid
//! (no WotLK MH2O), one 804-byte block per set liquid header bit. [`MclqChunk`] decodes it; we
//! validated the output **byte-identical** to a hand-decode of the raw payload against
//! `World\Maps\Azeroth\Azeroth_32_48.adt` (2026-05-31): per-vertex `height`, raw `tile_flags` and
//! `min/max_height` all match (the on-disk `QLCM` magic sits at the offset; the payload — and the
//! crate's parse — start 8 bytes in).
//!
//! Output is in **raw WoW coords** (+X north, +Y west, +Z up, yards), like [`crate::terrain`]; the
//! renderer applies the WoW→Bevy transform and ports the `ocean0_s.bls` shader. We emit a flat
//! surface (normal `(0,0,1)`) of 2 triangles per **wet** cell; dry cells (flag low-nibble `0xf`,
//! whose verts carry the FLT_MAX sentinel height) are skipped.
//!
//! **The cell nibble is the type** (VERIFIED `0x6ba970`/`0x68d9b0`) — the MCNK header bits only say
//! how many blocks a chunk carries, and their bit→type ordering was never byte-proven. Reading the
//! type off the header instead is what kept every open-world lava surface in the game from
//! rendering (Burning Steppes, Searing Gorge, Un'Goro) and what put the ocean texture on 28 coastal
//! river blocks while dropping the sea beside them. `build_liquid_mesh` runs the cells first for
//! exactly that reason.
