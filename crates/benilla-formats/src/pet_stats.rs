//! `PetPersonality.dbc` + `PetLoyalty.dbc` — the two tables behind a hunter pet's happiness and
//! loyalty readouts (decision 1005; wow-re `ui/scratch/pet-action-bar-api.md` §11b).
//!
//! **`GetPetHappiness` does its own thresholding.** The client does not hand Lua a raw happiness
//! number for the UI to bucket — it returns a **pre-bucketed 1/2/3** plus the two numbers that
//! bucket implies, from a three-column-triple row (`0x4be947`–`0x4be9c3`):
//!
//! ```text
//! rec = <table>[personalityId]           ; missing/out-of-range -> FALLBACK rec = <table>[1]
//! raw = UNIT_FIELD_POWER5                ; the happiness power
//! esi = 0; while (esi < 3 && raw >= rec[0x28 + 4*esi]) esi++      ; the three thresholds
//! ret1 = esi                             ; 0..3
//! ret2 = rec[0x30 + 4*esi] * 100.0f      ; damage percentage   (esi >= 1)
//! ret3 = rec[0x3c + 4*esi]               ; loyalty rate        (esi >= 1, may be NEGATIVE)
//! ```
//!
//! **Which `.dbc` backs it was NOT carved** — wow-re records `[0xc0d9e0]`/`[0xc0d9e4]` only as an
//! anonymous BSS `{indexTable, maxId}` pair, and the dispatch that produced the carve glossed the
//! index as a *creature family*. That gloss is wrong, and the file settles it: `CreatureFamily.dbc`
//! has a **0x48-byte** record — the read at `rec+0x48` would run off the end — and every dword from
//! `0x28` up is zero in all 23 rows. `PetPersonality.dbc` is a 0x4c-byte record whose last nine
//! columns are exactly the three triples, at exactly those offsets:
//!
//! | id | thresholds `0x28` | damage `0x34` | loyalty rate `0x40` |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 1 | 0 / 333000 / 666000 | 0.75 / 1.00 / 1.25 | −10 / 5 / 20 |
//! | 3 | 0 / 250000 / 750000 | 0.00 / 1.00 / 1.25 | −1 / 0 / 2 |
//!
//! Row 1 is vanilla's documented pet-happiness behaviour on the nose — unhappy pets deal 75%
//! damage, content 100%, happy 125%, against a happiness power that runs 0…1,000,000 in thirds —
//! which is the independent corroboration that this is the table and row 1 is the row live pets
//! use. (See [`PetPersonalities::for_pet`] for what is still open: *which field* selects the row.)
//!
//! `PetLoyalty.dbc` is the plain half: 8 rows, `ID` + the localized `Name` block, read at
//! `[[0xc0d9f4][lvl] + 4*locale + 4]` — i.e. `Name` enUS is field 1, the same shape every other
//! localized table here uses.
