//! The **art extent** of a glue scene — how far its art actually paints around its authored
//! camera, measured off the geometry and the textures (decision 1619).
//!
//! Every `UI_<Race>` / `UI_MainMenu` diorama was composed for a 4:3 screen (1587: the Lua design
//! space is `1024×768`), and its backdrop is *finite*: a sky card of some authored width, a ground
//! plane that stops. A camera law that widens the view on a wide window (1587's hor+) keeps showing
//! more of the diorama until the art runs out — and past that edge the frame is the render target's
//! clear colour, which no taste calls a composition (B330: `UI_MainMenu`'s backdrop edges show at
//! 16:9, `UI_Tauren`'s at ~2.24:1). The reference never shows that void only because it never
//! widens; it zooms instead (0116/1543's diagonal-FOV law) and crops the character at 21:9 (B242).
//!
//! So the framing law needs one more authored fact per scene: **how wide is the art**. This module
//! measures it. In camera 0's own tan-space — `x' = x/z`, `y' = y/z` in a right-handed eye frame,
//! the space a projection's half-extents live in — it rasterises every batch that paints into a
//! coverage grid and asks:
//!
//! - across the authored **vertical** opening (`±tan(fovy/2)` at 4:3), what horizontal half-width
//!   does *every* row reach, left and right of the axis? → [`ArtExtent::half_w`]
//! - across the authored **horizontal** opening, what vertical half-height does every column
//!   reach? → [`ArtExtent::half_h`]
//!
//! The minimum over rows is the point: a sky card seen in perspective is a trapezoid on screen, and
//! the frame runs out of it at the *narrow* row first (MainMenu's edges slant inward toward the
//! top).
//!
//! **What counts as painted is the texel, not the batch.** An `Opaque` batch paints every pixel it
//! covers. A `Blend`/`AlphaTest` batch paints where its texture's alpha would pass the reference's
//! own alpha test — **`≥ 224/255`**, the 1.12 alpha-key reference (wow-re `models.md`, not Cata's
//! 128) — sampled per pixel through the batch's UVs, perspective-correct, with its wrap/clamp mode.
//! Both halves of that rule matter on the real art: the artists drew `UI_Human`'s street and its
//! sky card as *blend* batches over opaque textures (so "opaque batches only" measured that scene
//! at half its authored box), and `UI_NightElf`'s edges are an alpha-tested wall of trees over a
//! sky card that ends at exactly 4:3 (so "opaque textures only" measured it a full step narrower
//! than what is on screen). A cloud, a canopy, a ground shadow, `UI_Tauren`'s 0.55 corner vignette
//! paint only where their texels pass, which is nowhere at their soft edges — the void this
//! measures for. `Mod`/`Mod2x` only tint what is already drawn. Backfaces of single-sided batches
//! are skipped the way the renderer skips them (`Face::Back` cull, CCW front — the model's own
//! winding survives the axis remap, a proper rotation), so a ground plane seen from below does not
//! count as sky.
//!
//! Because the rule reads textures, the measurement runs **offline**, off the chain: `benilla-
//! extract glueextent` prints every scene's numbers, and the client carries them as
//! [`shipped_glue_art_extent`] — a transcription of the shipped 1.12.1 art's authored width,
//! pinned by [`tests::the_shipped_table_matches_the_measurement`], which re-measures every scene
//! against the table. (A runtime probe at scene spawn would have to wait for every batch texture
//! to land before it could answer, and until it answered the login gate would open with its void
//! edges showing, then snap.)
//!
//! Positions are the M2's own model space (WoW axes, Z up) and so is the camera — nothing here
//! needs the engine's frame. The consumer ([`benilla`]'s glue framing) turns the two numbers into a
//! ceiling on 1587's law.
