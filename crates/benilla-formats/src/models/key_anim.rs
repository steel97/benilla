//! The generic keyed-loop bake shared by the material-alpha (`mat_anim`) and texture-transform
//! (`tex_anim`) channels: ONE kernel-faithful sampler (k0 = last key ≤ t, step holds, linear
//! lerps, clamp past the last key — no wrap-lerp) and ONE clock resolution (gseq wrap vs
//! per-sequence band rebase), so the byte-verified sampling semantics (wow-re `eval.md`, and the
//! step-boundary fix) live in exactly one place.
//!
//! **A track bakes per SEQUENCE, not once.** A sequence-timeline track keys on one absolute
//! timeline that every sequence carves a band out of, so "the loop this track plays" is a question
//! about *which sequence is playing* — the reference re-reads it every frame from the playing
//! sequence's own key window (wow-re `eval.md` FN1 `0x713d50`: window = `ranges[seqSlot]`, and a
//! collapsed window `lo >= hi` resolves to the single key `keys[lo]`). Baking only the first
//! sequence's band was correct for a placed doodad — which arms `animations[0]` once and loops it
//! forever — and wrong for anything that changes sequence, i.e. every creature: a voidwalker's two
//! upper armour pieces are weight `0` in Stand/Walk/Run and `1` only in Death, and a seq-0-only
//! bake freezes whichever value Stand happened to hold.
