//! The animated **material-alpha** bake (decision 0130 phase 2): each M2 batch's colour-alpha and
//! transparency-weight tracks, baked to loopable second-domain keys the runtime samples per instance
//! — **one loop per sequence**, because which loop plays is a function of the playing animation.
//!
//! Byte ground (wow-re `m2-alpha-combine-cull.md`, VERIFIED): the per-batch alpha is
//! `A = instanceAlpha × colors[colorIndex].alpha × transparency[transLookup[idx]].weight`, both
//! tracks animation-evaluated each frame; `A ≤ 0` skips the batch before the blend mode is read, and
//! an Opaque batch with `0 < A < 1` still draws opaque (no blend promotion). Clocks (wow-re
//! `eval.md`/`doodad-anim-host.md`): a `gseq`-tagged track wraps `global_sequences[gseq]`; an
//! ordinary track keys inside the **playing** sequence's absolute time band — for a placed doodad
//! that is the file-order-first sequence looping forever, but a creature changes sequence constantly
//! and its batches' visibility changes with it (a voidwalker's upper armour pair is weight 0 in
//! Stand/Walk/Run and 1 only in Death).
//!
//! The sampler + clock resolution live in [`super::key_anim`] (shared with the texture-transform
//! bake); this module owns only the alpha channel's semantics.
