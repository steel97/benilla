//! `ChatProfanity.dbc` + `SpamMessages.dbc` — the two shipped pattern lists behind 1.12's
//! `profanityFilter` and `spamFilter` (decision 2077; wow-re `system/ui/scratch/text-filter-law.md`).
//!
//! **They are regular expressions, not word lists.** The reference compiles every row with PCRE
//! (`0x71fba0` → `pcre_compile 0x720250`, options `0x2801` = CASELESS | UTF8 | NO_UTF8_CHECK) at
//! startup — one linear pass, `0x402b7f → 0x6c91a0`, no reload path — and a row that fails to
//! compile is **skipped** rather than stored, so the live count is the number that compiled. On the
//! shipped data none fails.
//!
//! This module only *reads* the rows. Translating a pattern into something a modern engine runs, and
//! the mask/predicate laws over them, are the client's (`benilla_app::text_filter`).
//!
//! **The archive matters, and it is the easy thing to get wrong.** Both files must resolve through
//! the ordinary priority walk, not out of `dbc.MPQ`: `ChatProfanity` is **2289** rows in `patch.MPQ`
//! against 1512 in `dbc.MPQ`, and `dbc.MPQ` carries no `SpamMessages` at all. Neither filename holds
//! a locale (`"DBFilesClient\ChatProfanity.dbc"` `0x858348`, `"DBFilesClient\SpamMessages.dbc"`
//! `0x859a84`, both literal, neither with a `%s`), so a locale build overrides them one layer down,
//! at the archive — which is exactly what [`crate::Chain`] already does.
//!
//! Layout: 2 × u32 — `{ID(0), Pattern(1)}`, and the pattern is a *plain* string column, not the
//! eight-slot localized shape (the list is multi-language in one table: of ChatProfanity's 2289
//! rows 850 are ASCII, the rest carry high bytes — Korean, Chinese, French).
//!
//! The two lists are **disjoint in practice**: the spam list is 28 gold-seller URL patterns, each
//! letter separated by `\s*` to defeat spacing.
