//! AuctionHouse.dbc — the **rates** each auction house charges: the deposit it takes to list an
//! item, and the cut it takes out of a sale.
//!
//! One consumer, and it is why the table has to be loaded rather than hardcoded: the sell pane's
//! `Deposit:` line has to show a number *before* the item is listed, so the client computes it
//! locally — `GetAuctionHouseDepositRate()` is a straight read of [`AuctionHouseCatalog::deposit_percent`]
//! at the house the session is talking to. Which house that is arrives on the wire:
//! `MSG_AUCTION_HELLO`'s reply carries a `houseId` alongside the auctioneer guid, and it keys this
//! table (decision 1511). Send the window the wrong id and the pane quietly shows Blackwater's 25%
//! where a city auctioneer charges 5%.
//!
//! Record layout (7 rows in the shipped 5875 file, verified by reading it): `ID@0`, `FactionID@1`,
//! `DepositPercent@2`, `CutPercent@3`, `Name_Lang@4..11`, `NameFlags@12`. Ids are 1..=7 and
//! contiguous, but this is keyed rather than indexed for the reason every catalog here is keyed: a
//! `houseId` off the wire is data, not an index we control.
//!
//! The shipped table is two tiers — the six faction houses charge **5% / 5%**, and Blackwater
//! (id 7, the neutral goblin house at faction 369) charges **25% / 15%**. That spread is the whole
//! economic point of the neutral auction house, so it is data worth reading rather than a constant
//! worth inlining.
//!
//! **The rate is only half of the deposit.** The server's charge also scales by stack count, by
//! duration, and by its own `Rate.Auction.Deposit` config multiplier, none of which live here; and
//! the real client's displayed number is computed with an intermediate truncation the server's is
//! not, so the two can disagree by a copper or two on cheap items. Decision 1511 records that
//! divergence and what benilla does about it — this module only supplies the percentage.
