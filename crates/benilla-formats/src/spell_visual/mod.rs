//! `SpellVisual.dbc` + `SpellVisualKit.dbc` + `SpellVisualEffectName.dbc` +
//! `SpellChainEffects.dbc` — the per-lifecycle-stage kit chain a cast plays
//! (decision 0099 phase 2's data plane; schemas pinned by decision 0107, the chain table by 0955).
//!
//! Layout — VERIFIED against build 5875 (WDBC header dump of the extracted files, 2026-07-04;
//! wow-re `system/dbc/scratch/spellvisual-schema.md` @ commit `ff91e7eb`, corroborated by vmangos
//! `DBCStructure.h:613-640` `SpellVisualEntry` and our own header bytes):
//!
//! - **SpellVisual**: 2165 records × 16 fields × 64 B, all-`u32` (a 1-byte empty string block).
//!   Field 0 = id; **field 1 = precastKit · field 2 = castKit · field 3 = impactKit · field 4 =
//!   stateKit · field 5 = channelKit** — each a `SpellVisualKit` id, `0` = no kit at that stage.
//!   The missile block (decision 0099 phase 4, wow-re `spell-visual-lifecycle.md` §Q4 — every
//!   consumption byte-cited in the client's missile spawn `0x60a3d0`): **field 7 = the missile's
//!   `SpellVisualEffectName` id** (`<1` → the ammo/weapon model; unresolvable → the client's
//!   literal `Spells\ErrorCube.mdx`), **field 9 = the destination-attachment ordinal** (an index
//!   into [`MISSILE_ATTACH_TABLE`], the client's `0x860a18` — dumped in wow-re
//!   `spell-visual-apply.md` §5), and **field 10 = the missile's in-flight LOOP sound**
//!   ([`SoundEntries`] id — Fireball's `FireMissileLoop`, the thrown dagger's `WeaponLoop`; the
//!   client's per-missile loop handle `CMissile+0x44`, wow-re `w2f1.md`). Field 6 (`hasMissile`)
//!   is never read by the missile spawn (its gate is `Spell.dbc` Speed alone) — its ONE reader
//!   is the GO dest one-shot's suppressor ([`VisualStages::missile_gate`], 0797); field 8
//!   (`missilePathType`) is dead-by-absence; **fields 11/12/13 are the dest-anchored block**
//!   ([`VisualStages::area_gate`]/[`VisualStages::area_effect`]/[`VisualStages::area_kit`] —
//!   wow-re `dynobject-visual-machine.md`, 0797). Stage
//!   semantics (decision 0107 verdict 2): the stage sets *lifetime policy* only —
//!   every populated slot on a reached row fires, precast persisting (reaped spell-id-keyed)
//!   while cast/impact self-terminate.
//! - **SpellVisualKit**: 1772 records × 35 fields × 140 B, all-`u32`. Field 0 = id; **field 2 =
//!   the `AnimationData.dbc` animation id** (fed to the same `PlayAnimation` one-shot/overlay
//!   route as melee swings — decision 0107 verdict 3); **field 13 = a `SoundEntries.dbc` id**;
//!   **fields 3–11 are the nine `SpellVisualEffectName` emitter slots** (attach-point VFX —
//!   decision 0099 phase 3, read here since that phase). Each slot's attach tag is a compile-time
//!   immediate in the client's slot loop (`0x60edf0`, byte-cited push sites — wow-re
//!   `spell-visual-apply.md` §1.3) and a **direct M2 `AttachmentID`**: in kit-field order,
//!   [`KIT_SLOT_TAGS`]. **Field 12 (`kit+0x30`) is a TENTH effect slot** — read here as
//!   [`VisualKit::world_effect`] (decision 0848): wow-re pinned its consumer as "the missile
//!   slot" (`0x60edf0` plays it inline via `0x61fcf0`, a `CEffect`-family node stamped with a
//!   missile marker — `spell-visual-apply.md` §1.4), but the shipped table's population is
//!   **body/ground state models**, never projectiles: the aura-state family the nine slots miss
//!   (Frost Nova's kit 285 → `Frost_Nova_state.mdx`, Net's 744 → `Net_State.mdx`, Entangling
//!   Roots' 66, Web's 746) plus caster-feet rings on cast/impact kits (Thunderclap's 349,
//!   Flamestrike's 420, Vanish's 389). Same `CEffect` lifecycle as the nine (spell-id-tagged on
//!   the unit's `+0xb4` list, the stage sets lifetime — §1.5). Placement is byte-pinned (wow-re
//!   `kit30-effect-slot.md`, folded back 0850): no bone — a one-time **world plant** at the
//!   owner's position/facing/scale, [`WORLD_EFFECT_TAG`]. Field 14 is a visual-group fallback
//!   id — not read here. **Fields 15–34 are the four `CharProc` slots** — the
//!   *character* half of a kit (the body's own alpha/tint, as opposed to the attach-point emitters):
//!   five parallel 4-element arrays, `CharProcType[4]` @+0x3c then `CharParamZero/One/Two/Three[4]`
//!   @+0x4c/+0x5c/+0x6c/+0x7c (wow-re `spellvisual-schema.md`, byte-pinned: all 20 consumed by the
//!   dispatcher `0x60d7c0`, which `lea edi,[kit+0x6c]` walks four times reading `[edi-0x30]` as the
//!   type key). Read here as [`VisualKit::char_procs`]; the type semantics are
//!   [`char_proc_type`]'s.
//! - **SpellVisualEffectName**: 5 fields × 20 B. Field 0 = id; field 1 = a name string — a debug
//!   label, and the lookup key for the client's boot-time HARDCODED-effect matcher (`0x61f5b0`
//!   over a 14-string table: loot art, footsteps, breath, level-up…; wow-re
//!   `loot-corpse-effect.md` + `levelup-ding.md`) — the `"HARDCODED *"` rows load into
//!   [`SpellVisualCatalog::hardcoded_effect`]'s name→path map (two consumers today: the corpse
//!   sparkle and the level-up ding); **field 2 = the effect model's `.mdx` path** (the
//!   column every consumer reads — fields 3/4 are dead-by-absence, wow-re
//!   `spellvisual-schema.md`; the emitter *scale* comes from kit CharProc params × the quality
//!   tier, never from this table).
//! - **SpellChainEffects**: 18 records × 8 fields × 32 B — the **beam/arc** geometry a kit's chain
//!   `CharProc` draws (Chain Lightning's lightning, Drain Life's rope, C'Thun's eye beam). Its own
//!   module: [`chain_effects`], decision 0955.
//!
//! **The none-sentinel, found empirically here (not pinned in the wow-re note):** on the real
//! table, "no value" for both field 2 (anim) and field 13 (sound) is written as **either `0` or
//! `0xFFFFFFFF`**, not consistently one or the other. Scanning all 1772 kits: 41 carry anim `0`,
//! 875 carry anim `0xFFFFFFFF`, 856 carry a real id (max 203, inside `AnimationData.dbc`'s 208
//! rows). Restricting to the 1433 kits actually reachable from a live `spell_template` visual
//! chain doesn't change the picture (692 are `-1` vs 26 `0` vs 715 real) — the `-1` form is the
//! majority for **impact**-stage kits specifically (966/1200: most magic impacts carry no body
//! reaction) while **cast**-stage kits are majority real (1168/1347: most casts do animate).
//! `sound` (field 13) shows the same dual encoding on a handful of rows (5 kits carry
//! `0xFFFFFFFF` alongside 647 carrying plain `0`). [`VisualKit::anim_id`]/[`VisualKit::sound`]
//! fold both forms to `None` so no consumer ever sees the raw sentinels.
//!
//! **Verified chain (Fireball, spell 133 → visual 67):** precast 30 / cast 38 / impact 286 /
//! state 0 / channel 0; kit 38 (cast) → anim 53 (`AnimationData` "SpellCastDirected") / sound
//! 1484; kit 286 (impact) → anim 9 (`AnimationData` "CombatWound" — a hit-reaction anim on the
//! target, corroborating decision 0107's wound-flinch ids 8–10) / sound 1507.
