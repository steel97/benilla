//! **The chat language scramble** — the reference's `0x49b560`, reimplemented.
//!
//! When someone speaks a language your character does not know, the *server* sends the sentence in
//! plaintext with a language id beside it and never rewrites it; turning it into gibberish is
//! entirely the client's job (B262 — opposite-faction speech rendered perfectly readable because
//! this step did not exist). This module is that step.
//!
//! **The mechanism is byte-verified** in wow-re `system/ui/scratch/chat-language-scramble.md` — a
//! §5 trio on the kernel plus two independent pairs, with an emulated oracle that runs the binary's
//! own bytes over the player's own `LanguageWords.dbc`. [`tests::the_reference_golden_vectors`]
//! carries all 35 of that note's golden vectors verbatim; they are the oracle this file is graded
//! against, and the note's own claim is that its prose is *sufficient* — a clean-room
//! implementation written from it reproduced every vector byte for byte. So did this one.
//!
//! The shape, in one paragraph. The line is walked as an alternating sequence of separator runs and
//! words. Each word is hashed once with `SStrHash` (case-folded, so `hello`/`Hello`/`HELLO` share a
//! hash and therefore a substitute); the *same* hash decides both whether that particular word is
//! understood (`hash % 300 < skill` — a **per-word, graduated** gate, not an all-or-nothing switch)
//! and, when it is not, which replacement is drawn from the `(language, byte length)` bucket of
//! `LanguageWords.dbc`. The source word's capitalisation is then stamped onto the replacement one
//! character at a time. Nothing is random and nothing is stateful: the mapping is a pure function
//! of the word's bytes, stable within a session and across sessions.
//!
//! **Three call sites in the reference, and the flags are what separate them** ([`Garble`]):
//! chat (`0x49aa7c`, both flags off), the NPC gossip greeting (`0x4e22ab`, `keep_punct`), and
//! readable item text (`0x4e35b0`, both). So the same language barrier covers gossip and books —
//! benilla only wires chat today, but the routine is the whole routine, not the chat slice of it.
