//! `ChrClasses.dbc` — the per-class client table, and the two columns anything here reads off it.
//!
//! One file, one parse. Both columns are answers the *engine* gives Lua about a class, and both
//! are read by address off the same class-indexed record table at `ds:0xc0def4`, bounded by the
//! max id at `ds:0xc0def8` (store `0xc0deec`, loader `0x542360`, filename `0x85838c`).
//!
//! ## Field 4 — the pet name token
//!
//! `HasPetSpells()`'s second return, and the only thing that decides whether the spellbook's
//! second tab reads "Pet" or "Demon" (decision 1032). `HasPetSpells 0x4b4410` pushes it verbatim:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x4b445d  eax = [player + 0x110]                  ; the descriptor fields
//! 0x4b4463  eax = byte [fields + 0x79]              ; UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0 byte 1 = the CLASS
//! 0x4b446b  if (class < 0 || class > [0xc0def8]) -> the out-of-range arm
//! 0x4b4473  ecx = [0xc0def4]                        ; the class record table
//! 0x4b4479  eax = ecx[class]                        ; 1-BASED — index 0 is never a class
//! 0x4b447c  edx = [rec + 0x10]                      ; <- the token string
//! 0x4b44a6  (player did not resolve) edx = "PET"    ; the literal 0x846a40
//! ```
//!
//! **`rec + 0x10` is field 4, and the file says which field that is**: dumped from the real 5875
//! `ChrClasses.dbc` (9 rows, 17 columns, 0x44-byte records), field 4 is `"PET"` in every row except
//! Warlock (id 9), which is `"DEMON"`. Field 5 is the class name (`Warrior`/`Paladin`/…), so a
//! one-column slip would put "Warlock" on the tab — plausible enough to ship, which is why
//! [`tests`] anchors both columns.
//!
//! FrameXML then does `getglobal("PET_TYPE_"..token)` (`SpellBookFrame.lua:173`) against
//! `PET_TYPE_PET = "Pet"` / `PET_TYPE_DEMON = "Demon"` (`GlobalStrings.lua:3057-3058`) — so the
//! token is a **key**, never display text, and it is right that it is not localized here.
//!
//! ## Field 16 — the relic-slot flag
//!
//! `UnitHasRelicSlot 0x519e50` reads it and nothing else. Same walk — typemask bit 4 (PLAYER),
//! `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0` byte 1 for the class, bound against `0xc0def8`, index `0xc0def4` — then:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x519ebb  mov ecx,[row + 0x40]                    ; <- field 16, the relic flag
//! ```
//!
//! Non-zero pushes the **number 1.0**; zero pushes **nil** (never `false`). There is no `cmp`
//! against a class id anywhere in the function: 1.12 is entirely data-driven here, and this table
//! is the data. In the shipped file the column is 1 for exactly **2 Paladin, 7 Shaman, 11 Druid**
//! — Libram, Totem, Idol.
//!
//! **Why this was believed impossible, and the trap worth keeping.** The base `dbc.MPQ` copy of
//! this file is **16 fields / 64-byte records and has no field 16 at all**; `patch.MPQ` supersedes
//! it with the 17-field / 68-byte version, and the 5875 loader asserts exactly those two numbers
//! (`0x54240e`/`0x542446`), so the patch copy is the only one the client can read. Read the base
//! archive alone — or an early-vanilla 16-column struct — and the flag simply is not there, which
//! is how "the relic slot post-dates 1.12" became a settled belief in this codebase and stayed one
//! across two decision records. It is false; see decision 1796. [`CHR_CLASSES_FIELDS`] is what
//! keeps us on the patch copy, and it is load-bearing, not defensive.
//!
//! The flag is engine-enforced, not a UI conceit: `IsValidForSlot 0x5da1d0`'s `slot == 0x11` leg
//! requires `(InventoryType == 28 RELIC) == hasRelicSlot`, so **INVSLOT 17 takes a relic for those
//! three classes and a ranged weapon for everyone else** — one slot, two meanings. 1.12 has no
//! *separate* relic slot, which is the one true fragment inside the old belief.
