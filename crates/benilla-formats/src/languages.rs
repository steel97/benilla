//! `Languages.dbc` × `ChrRaces.dbc` — the one join behind `GetDefaultLanguage()`.
//!
//! The binding `0x49fcd0` (94 bytes; wow-re `ui/scratch/bag-language-combat-action-bindings.md`
//! §2, §5-cross-checked) is a two-hop table walk and nothing else:
//!
//! ```text
//! player race byte  ->  [0xc0dee0][race] + 0x20   =  base language id
//!                   ->  [0xc0db48][id]  + 4 + 4·[0xc0e080]  =  the localized name
//! ```
//!
//! `+0x20` on a `ChrRaces` record is byte offset 32, i.e. **field 8** — which the shipped 5875
//! data confirms independently: field 8 reads **7 for Human/Dwarf/Night Elf/Gnome/Goblin and 1 for
//! Orc/Undead/Tauren/Troll**, and `Languages.dbc` rows 7 and 1 are `Common` and `Orcish`. So the
//! "default" language is the **faction** language, not the racial one — a Night Elf's default is
//! Common, an Undead's is Orcish, and Darnassian/Gutterspeak are *additional* languages the
//! `GetLanguageByIndex` family enumerates. (Field 9, its neighbour, is `CreatureType` = 7 Humanoid
//! for every playable race — already anchored elsewhere in this crate's consumers, which is what
//! makes the field-8 identification a cross-check rather than a count.)
//!
//! Verified against the real chain below: 13 language rows, 9 race rows, and the nine races
//! resolving to exactly two distinct names.
//!
//! **Locale.** `[0xc0e080]` is the client's locale slot and only column 0 (enUS) is populated in
//! this install — every other DBC catalog in this crate reads column 0 for the same reason. The
//! loader keeps the whole locale row so a localized build has somewhere to go; the app asks for
//! the slot it wants.
