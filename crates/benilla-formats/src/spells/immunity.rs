//! The crowd-control **exemption** — `0x6e9ca0`'s aura scan and `0x6e9d70`'s immunity matcher
//! (decision 1946; wow-re `equipped-item-and-cc-cast-gates.md` §2.3/§2.4, byte-verified).
//!
//! Each of the six crowd-control arms in the cast validator asks this before it refuses: *does one
//! of the caster's own auras grant immunity to the thing blocking me?* The answer is not a flag
//! lookup — it is a join between two `Spell.dbc` records, the spell **being cast** and the aura
//! **doing the blocking**, and the question it really asks is "is the spell I am casting an
//! immunity that covers this aura?" — Ice Block cast while stunned, and its kin.
//!
//! **Its ordinary answer is "no", and that is the point.** The matcher's first gate is
//! `AttributesEx` bit 15 on the *cast*, which is clear on essentially every ordinary spell — so a
//! normal cast falls out immediately and the arm refuses. What the scan changes is *which message*
//! the refusal carries, and the rare real exemption.
