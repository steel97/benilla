//! Unit reaction: the FactionTemplate.dbc catalog + the client's faction-reaction comparator.
//!
//! A unit's `UNIT_FIELD_FACTIONTEMPLATE` indexes **FactionTemplate.dbc**; the real client decides
//! hostile/neutral/friendly by comparing two of those rows with one pure function — the reaction
//! comparator at `0x606640` (wow-5875-re object-layer, byte-verified disasm, §5-cross-checked). Every
//! `UnitReaction`/`CanAttack`/`CanAssist` predicate bottoms out in it, and it's what colours nameplates
//! and the ground selection ring (red/yellow/green). [`FactionTemplate::reaction_toward`] is that
//! function, branch-for-branch.
//!
//! Record layout verified by the offsets the comparator reads (0x38-byte rows = 14 × u32, matching
//! vmangos `FactionTemplateEntry`): id@0, faction@1 (Faction.dbc id), flags@2, factionGroupMask@3,
//! friendGroupMask@4, enemyGroupMask@5, enemies[4]@6..9, friends[4]@10..13 (both id lists
//! 0-terminated).
//!
//! Also here: the **reputation identity** side of the decode — Faction.dbc's reputation slot,
//! parent pointer and race/class-gated base values ([`FactionInfo`]), the standing→rank thresholds
//! ([`reputation_rank`]), and the names of the wire flag byte's bits ([`faction_flags`]). The client
//! checks `FactionHasReputation` *before* the comparator (`0x606530`): a reputation faction's NPCs
//! colour by the player's rank, not by templates. The live standings are session state
//! (`SMSG_INITIALIZE_FACTIONS`) and live with the net layer.
//!
//! Two consumers share that identity now — the reaction decode above, and the **reputation pane**
//! (decision 1258, whose display law is `benilla-ui`'s `script::reputation`). Where both need the
//! same number they take it from the same function here, so a rank the pane draws and a colour the
//! nameplate paints can never disagree.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** here: the rest of the real `UnitReaction 0x6061e0` orchestration —
//! same-object/group/guild shortcuts, charm resolution, PvP-flag + sanctuary overrides. Those need
//! player/session state, not DBC rows; they land with the systems that own it.
