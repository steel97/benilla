//! `CreatureFamily.dbc` + `ItemPetFood.dbc` — the pet's **family word** and the **diet** it implies
//! (decision 1062): `UnitCreatureFamily`'s "Imp"/"Wolf"/"Cat", and `GetPetFoodTypes`'s
//! "Meat, Fish".
//!
//! Both layouts below were **dumped from this install's own shipped files** rather than taken from
//! memory or a wiki — the WDBC header first, then every column of every row, then a census of what
//! each column actually holds. What that dump says:
//!
//! **`CreatureFamily.dbc` — 18 fields, `record_size` 0x48, 23 rows, string block 933 bytes.**
//!
//! | field | byte | holds |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | 0x00 | `ID` — 1..28 with gaps (10, 13, 14, 18, 22 are absent) |
//! | 1 | 0x04 | `minScale`, a **float** (0.4 … 1.0) |
//! | 2 | 0x08 | `minScaleLevel` — **1 on all 22 real families**, warlock minions included; 0 only on row 28 |
//! | 3 | 0x0c | `maxScale`, a **float** (0.6 … 1.1) |
//! | 4 | 0x10 | `maxScaleLevel` — **60 on all 22**; 0 only on row 28 |
//! | 5 | 0x14 | `skillLine[0]` — a `SkillLine.dbc` id (188…758), distinct on every row |
//! | 6 | 0x18 | `skillLine[1]` — 270 on every tameable family, 0 on the rest |
//! | 7 | 0x1c | **`petFoodMask`** — the bitfield this module's other half indexes |
//! | 8..15 | 0x20 | the localized `Name` block; **enUS is field 8**, the other seven are all zero |
//! | 16 | 0x40 | the name block's locale-present flags (0x7EFFFE or 0x3F007E) — **not** zero |
//! | 17 | 0x44 | `iconFile` — `Interface\Icons\Ability_Hunter_Pet_*` (a string, not a dword) |
//!
//! (The 2026-08-06 dump's note that the level columns are "0 for the warlock ones" was wrong, and
//! is corrected above off the shipped file: Imp/Voidwalker/Succubus/Felhunter/Doomguard all read
//! 1 → 60 like every hunter family, and simply carry `minScale == maxScale` so their ramp is flat.
//! Only "Remote Control" (row 28) is 0/0/0/0. It matters because those four columns are the
//! character-select pet's SIZE — decision 1538.)
//!
//! That confirms the `0x48` record and the 23 rows [`crate::pet_stats`]'s header already recorded,
//! and **corrects its "every dword from `0x28` up is zero"**: fields 10..15 (`0x28`–`0x3c`) are
//! indeed all zero — which is what that argument actually rested on, since the reads it was ruling
//! out were at `+0x28`/`+0x30`/`+0x3c`/`+0x48` — but `0x40` and `0x44` are not. The conclusion
//! stands (a `rec+0x48` read still runs off the end of a 0x48-byte record); the sentence was one
//! column too wide.
//!
//! **`ItemPetFood.dbc` — 10 fields, `record_size` 0x28, 8 rows, string block 55 bytes**: `ID`@0,
//! the localized `Name` block@1..8 (**enUS is field 1**, the rest zero), name flags@9. The eight
//! rows in id order are exactly `Meat / Fish / Cheese / Bread / Fungus / Fruit / Raw Meat /
//! Raw Fish`.
//!
//! **The mask's bit → row mapping is `bit b` → `ItemPetFood` row `b + 1`** (see
//! [`PetFoodNames::for_mask`]) — DATA-derived twice over. The highest bit any shipped row sets is
//! **7** (Turtle, mask 178) and the table has exactly 8 rows, so a 0-based mapping would leave row
//! 8 permanently unreachable and Wolf (mask 1) with an empty diet. And vmangos, reading the same
//! file, tests exactly `1 << (item->FoodType - 1)` against this column (`Objects/Pet.cpp:1503-1504`,
//! `Database/DBCStructure.h:251` — its `CreatureFamilyfmt` `"nfifiiiissssssssxx"` is this table's
//! layout above, field for field). Every resulting diet matches vanilla's documented ones: Wolf =
//! Meat, Cat = Meat+Fish, Bear/Boar = all six, Gorilla = Fungus+Fruit, Wind Serpent = Fish+Cheese+
//! Bread.
//!
//! **All of the above is now also byte-VERIFIED** (wow-re, 2026-08-06 — `GetPetFoodTypes 0x4bea10`
//! and `UnitCreatureFamily 0x51a310`), and the two dumps agree line for line with nothing left
//! over: the mask is column 7, the bit map is `1 << (recordID - 1)`, the family name is column
//! `8 + locale`, the food name is column `1 + locale`, the id space really does have null rows at
//! 10/13/14/18/22, and the binary's own positive controls (Wolf → Meat; Bear and Boar → all six;
//! Turtle → Fish/Fungus/Fruit/Raw Fish) are the rows asserted below. The one claim that had been
//! flagged INFERRED here — that the walk is **low bit first** — is settled the same way: the client
//! pushes in **record order**, which is what ascending bits produce.
//!
//! What this module deliberately does **not** model is `GetPetFoodTypes`' own `0x6116e0` gate
//! (owner-is-me + the local player is a Hunter). That is a live-state question, not a table one, so
//! it lives at the feed (`benilla_app::ui_pet_stats`) — and it is why a charmed boar under a priest
//! answers an empty diet despite a mask of 63.
