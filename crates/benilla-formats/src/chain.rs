//! The vanilla patch chain — a priority-ordered set of MPQ archives, read through `benilla-mpq`.
//!
//! Replaces `wow-mpq`'s `PatchChain` *and* the old `ChainReader` (decision 0021). Those were two types
//! because `wow-mpq`'s `Archive::open` re-parsed the hash/block (and the useless `(attributes)`) tables
//! on every open, so `ChainReader` bolted a `Mutex<HashMap<…, Archive>>` handle-cache on top to avoid
//! re-paying that per read. `benilla_mpq::Archive` now caches its parsed tables in an `Arc` and reads
//! `&self` (a fresh OS handle per read, no seek-state sharing), so the cache is gone and one `Chain`
//! serves both the `&self` concurrent Bevy `AssetReader` path and the `&mut` streaming-loader path.
//!
//! Later archives override earlier ones for files sharing an internal path (so a patch archive
//! wins); a read resolves a name to the highest-priority archive that holds it. Base content
//! archives carry no `(listfile)`, so resolution is by name **hash**, which works without one.
//! Which archives mount, and in what order, is [`mount_order`]'s law (decision 1300).
