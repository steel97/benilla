//! **Where the WoW install is** — THE ONE ANSWER (decision 1175).
//!
//! 0954 made every path benilla *writes* resolve through one module, on the grounds that a
//! hand-built path is a place the rule can be got wrong. Its *input* path never got the same
//! treatment: the string
//! `PathBuf::from(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")).join("../../WoW/Data")` was hand-copied to 215+
//! sites, alongside 11 bare `var("WOW_DATA")` reads and 271 copies of the same four-line "is it
//! there? if not, skip" guard whose message had drifted into five variants. Every one of those is
//! a place the release rule would have to be written again — and the first Windows build finds
//! every place someone forgot. This module is the rule, written once.
//!
//! **The rule, in the director's words:** *everything should always assume that the wow/data
//! folder is in the project folder or the folder the binary is run from.*
//!
//! It lives in `benilla-formats` because every consumer already depends on it — `benilla-app`,
//! `benilla-assets`, `benilla-world`, and the two detached probes — and because this crate already
//! owns [`crate::Chain`], the thing you open *with* the answer.
//!
//! ## Resolution order
//!
//! 1. **`$WOW_DATA`** — the explicit override, for a second install or a non-standard layout. Kept
//!    because the director's rule is about what the client *assumes*, not about removing the
//!    escape hatch; the sprawl was 11 reads of it, not the variable itself. **Set and empty**
//!    (`WOW_DATA=`) means *there is no install*: the ladder stops there and returns nothing, which
//!    is how a machine that has an install can still run the no-install path (decision 1451).
//! 2. **`<project folder>/WoW/Data`** — `#[cfg(feature = "dev")]` only. Computed from **this
//!    crate's** `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, which lands on the same workspace root whichever crate is
//!    asking, and is what the repo-root `WoW` symlink points at. Gated because a shipped binary
//!    must not carry the build machine's source tree: that is the whole point of the record.
//! 3. **`<exe dir>/Data`, then `<exe dir>/WoW/Data`** — the release convention. Drop benilla into
//!    your WoW folder, or drop a `WoW/` folder beside benilla, and double-click. Both spellings
//!    are cheap to accept and a player will try both.
//!
//! Every candidate must **exist** to be chosen, so a stale `$WOW_DATA` falls through to a real
//! install rather than poisoning the run. [`wow_data`] returns `None` when none of them do — the
//! honest answer, and the one [`wow_data_or_skip`] turns into a uniform test skip.
//!
//! **The feature-unification trap** (called out in the record, and the reason
//! `scripts/gates.sh`'s `--no-default-features` line exists): `dev` is default-on here, so every
//! dependent must declare `default-features = false` and re-export it, or a player build pulls
//! candidate 2 back in through unification and the binary carries `/Users/…` after all. The gate
//! is what catches getting this wrong; [`tests::a_player_build_carries_no_source_tree_path`] is
//! what catches it here.
