//! `ChrRaces.dbc` → the **PvP team digit** — `0x5efe00`, the second `%d` of
//! `PVP_RANK_<rank>_<team>`.
//!
//! The engine never asks a unit what faction template it is *currently* carrying for this; it asks
//! what RACE it is, and walks the race's own table:
//!
//! ```text
//! 5efe06  movzx eax, BYTE PTR [[obj+0x110]+0x78]   ; UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0 byte 0 = race
//!         -> ChrRaces  [0xc0dee0][race]   +0x08    ; field 2 = FactionTemplate id
//!         -> FactionTemplate [0xc0dd3c][id] +0x0c  ; field 3 = factionGroupMask
//! 5efe42  test al,4 ; je ...                       ; mask & 4 -> 0 (Horde)
//! 5efe49  and al,2 ; …                             ; mask & 2 -> 1 (Alliance), else -1
//! 5efe54  (any bound/NULL failure)                 -> -1
//! ```
//!
//! (wow-re `system/ui/scratch/honor-panel-law.md` §3.11, VERIFIED; the `0`/`1` assignment is
//! settled there against the shipped `FactionGroup.dbc` and `GlobalStrings.lua`, not inferred.)
//!
//! **This is not `UnitFactionGroup`**, which reads the live `UNIT_FIELD_FACTIONTEMPLATE`
//! (`0x5166b8`/`0x5166be`) and so genuinely loses its side under GM mode. Confusing the two is
//! report B378 / decision 2227.
//!
//! Loaded only by [`crate::race_pvp_team::load_race_pvp_teams`]'s one consumer — the test that
//! pins `ui_unit::race_pvp_team`'s frozen table to the shipped tables. The runtime answer is that
//! table: nine constant rows of a 2006 file are not worth a DBC resource threaded through every
//! unit snapshot, but they are worth a test that fails if the file ever disagrees.
