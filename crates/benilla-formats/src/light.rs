//! Authentic vanilla atmosphere from the client's lighting DBCs — so fog distance/color and
//! sun/ambient tint come from Blizzard's authored data, not invented constants.
//!
//! Pipeline: [`Light.dbc`] gives a sphere per area (a world
//! position via [`dbc_to_world`] + a radius in yards) and a `LightParams` id per weather condition;
//! that id indexes the band tables — [`LightIntBand.dbc`] (18 color rows/param) and
//! [`LightFloatBand.dbc`] (6 float rows/param) — each row a value over time-of-day. We sample the
//! **clear-weather** param at a given time and return the fog/sun/ambient/sky values.
//!
//! **Verified against build 5875** (raw-byte decode cross-checked with wowdev.wiki, 2026-05-25):
//! headers are Light = 12 fields/48 B (5 param refs), both bands = 34 fields/136 B
//! (`ID, num, time[16], value[16]`). LightIntBand = 7668 = 426×18 rows and LightFloatBand =
//! 2556 = 426×6 rows — i.e. exactly 18 int / 6 float rows per LightParams, confirming the band row
//! id for param `P` (1-based), band index `b`: `(P-1)*per + b + 1` (== wiki `P*18−17` / `P*6−5`).
//! The int-row→meaning map is the **vanilla** layout (rows 2–6 = the 5 sky stops, 7 = fog, 9 = sun),
//! confirmed by the data itself (row 8 is flat gray = shadow-opacity slot, not a sun). The
//! decoded values match our parser exactly (e.g. Northshire/global-light param 12 noon SkyMiddle
//! = `(58,162,207)`).
