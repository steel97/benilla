//! `benilla-extract` — Phase 1 CLI over WoW 1.12.1 (build 5875) MPQ archives.
//!
//! Implemented: `list`, `extract` (raw bytes), operating on the **patch chain**
//! (later archives override earlier; real names come from patch.MPQ's `(listfile)`).
//! BLP->PNG and DBC->CSV come next.
//!
//! This file is the stable face: the clap [`Cli`]/[`Command`] definitions, the dispatch `match`,
//! and the tiny helpers shared across concerns. The heavier subcommands live in sibling modules by
//! concern: per-model M2 dump printers ([`m2dump`]), corpus-scan reports ([`scan`]), and the spell
//! visual chain ([`spellvis`]).
