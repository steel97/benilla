//! Stamps the **commit this binary was built from** into the binary: `src/main.rs` reads the
//! four vars back with `env!` and hands them to `benilla_app::run` as its `BuildId` resource
//! (`benilla-app/src/build_id.rs` — the runtime side and its two surfaces).
//!
//! Why it exists: people run benilla from a clone of the public snapshot repo, and a report ("this
//! looks wrong", "it crashed here") is only actionable if we know *which* code they ran. A git sha
//! is the only id that can't drift — the crate version is a permanent `0.1.0` and there are no
//! releases to number. For a public clone the stamp is the **snapshot** sha, which maps back to the
//! private commit exactly (`pubsync` tags it `pub/<public-short-sha>`); for our own worktrees it is
//! the private commit itself.
//!
//! It emits four `rustc-env` vars. The three git ones come back **empty** when git can't answer (a
//! source zip with no `.git`, or no `git` on PATH), which the runtime side reports as an unknown
//! build rather than failing to compile:
//!
//! - `BENILLA_GIT_SHA` — the full 40-char sha (what the panel copies to the clipboard).
//! - `BENILLA_GIT_SHORT` — git's own abbreviation, so the string matches the `pub/<sha>` tag names
//!   (`pubsync` abbreviates the same way, in the same repo).
//! - `BENILLA_GIT_DATE` — the commit date (`%cs`, `YYYY-MM-DD`). Committer date, not build date:
//!   it is a property of the sha, so it can never disagree with it.
//!
//! …plus `BENILLA_PROFILE`, the profile directory name — `debug` / `release` / `ship` (0736's
//! shipping profile). Cargo's own `PROFILE` var collapses every release-like profile to `release`,
//! so `ship` and `release` would be indistinguishable; the profile *directory* inside `OUT_DIR`
//! carries the real name, which is what a "why is this slow" report needs to say.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in a ~30-line shim package, not the app crate (decision 0993)
//!
//! Cargo dirties the compile units of the package that owns a `rerun-if-changed` path on the
//! file's **mtime alone** — before the build script even runs, identical output or not
//! (`cargo build -v` says it plainly: `Dirty benilla v0.1.0: the file …/HEAD has changed`). The
//! watched paths below move on every commit, rebase, and checkout, so the package carrying this
//! script re-compiles and relinks that often — and `cargo test` re-links every integration test
//! of that package too, sha-relevant or not. Stamped into the app crate (as it originally was,
//! 0787), that cost ~2 minutes of pure stamp tax per commit across the gates; in this shim it is
//! the shim's recompile plus one relink of the app. 0993 has the measurements.
//!
//! ## Staleness — the only thing that could make this lie
//!
//! A stamp is worthless if it can report a commit the binary isn't. The rerun triggers below are
//! therefore exactly the files that change when HEAD moves: `HEAD` itself (checkout, rebase,
//! detach) and the ref it names (a commit rewrites `refs/heads/<branch>`, not `HEAD`). Both are
//! resolved with `git rev-parse --git-path`, which applies the worktree rules — in a `wt.sh` pool
//! slot `.git` is a *file*, `HEAD` lives in `<primary>/.git/worktrees/<slot>/`, and `refs/heads/*`
//! stay in the common dir. Only paths that exist are emitted: cargo reruns a build script whose
//! watched path is *missing* on every build, and every one of those reruns relinks the app crate.
//!
//! What the stamp deliberately does **not** claim is that the working tree was clean: it names the
//! commit the build came *from*. A dirty flag can only be as fresh as the last build-script run, so
//! in the normal dev loop (edit, run, don't stage) it would read "clean" while the binary carried
//! uncommitted work — a flag that is wrong exactly when it matters. "Which snapshot" is the
//! question a remote report needs answered, and a bare sha answers it without lying.
