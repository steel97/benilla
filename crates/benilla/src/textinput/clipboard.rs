//! The host OS pasteboard seam — the one place benilla talks to the platform clipboard.
//!
//! The UI engine is engine-free and can't reach the OS clipboard (RF-0082's stated gap), so the
//! three clipboard chords ([`keymap::Chord`]) resolve host-side: copy/cut write out what
//! `editbox_copy`/`editbox_cut` hand back, paste reads the pasteboard and feeds `UiScript::paste`.
//!
//! **Why this is a held resource with a per-platform backend, and not `arboard::Clipboard::new()`
//! per call.** Both halves of copy/paste were broken on Linux, for two independent reasons
//! (decision 0702):
//!
//! 1. **On X11 the handle *is* the clipboard.** An X11 selection has no backing store: the owning
//!    client serves the bytes on request, so the clipboard lives exactly as long as the connection
//!    that owns it. arboard keeps one process-global connection plus a server thread and tears the
//!    whole thing down in `Drop` as soon as the last handle goes (its `MIN_OWNERS == 3` check —
//!    a lone handle *is* the last one), first offering the data to a clipboard manager. So a fresh
//!    handle per copy relinquishes the selection the instant the copy returns: with no clipboard
//!    manager running — a bare WM, the common gaming setup — text copied out of benilla vanishes
//!    immediately. One handle, held for the process lifetime, is the fix. macOS and Windows never
//!    showed this because `NSPasteboard` and the Win32 clipboard both take ownership of the *data*,
//!    not of a live connection, which is exactly why the per-call pattern read as fine.
//! 2. **Our window is Wayland; arboard here is X11-only.** benilla builds with bevy's `wayland`
//!    feature on, so on a Wayland session winit hands us a native Wayland window with no X11
//!    surface at all — while `arboard`, without its **non-default** `wayland-data-control` feature,
//!    only ever speaks X11. Reading then finds no X11 CLIPBOARD owner and fails with
//!    `ContentNotAvailable`: precisely the reported "can't paste into the client on Linux".
//!    Turning arboard's Wayland feature on is *not* the fix — it speaks `wlr-data-control`, a
//!    privileged clipboard-manager protocol GNOME/Mutter deliberately does not implement, and
//!    wl-clipboard-rs' own README points windowed apps at `smithay-clipboard` instead. So Wayland
//!    goes through `smithay-clipboard`, which drives the **standard** `wl_data_device` from our own
//!    winit `wl_display` and seat — the protocol every compositor supports.
//!
//! Windows needs none of this: `clipboard-win` resolves with no feature gates and the Win32
//! clipboard is store-backed, so the chord table ([`keymap`]) was already the whole story
//! there.
