//! Ground-level spell-effect quads as **projected surface decals** — the third client of the
//! shared decal projector (`decal.rs`), after the selection ring and the unit blob shadow.
//!
//! A base-anchored effect model's flat ground-plane quads (Battle Shout's six crescents, the
//! paladin auras' rings, Consecration's and Flamestrike's hovering burn discs —
//! [`benilla_formats::GroundQuad`], the `groundscan` z=0 + hover populations) author every
//! vertex on one ground-level plane (z = 0, or hovering fractions of a yard above it) with depth-test ON: drawn as
//! free geometry they are buried per-pixel by the first up-slope and float over the first
//! down-slope. The real 1.12 client draws them exactly that way (standard M2 batch pipeline —
//! no ground conform exists in the spell-visual chain); this lane is a deliberate modern
//! improvement, director-directed: anything that *needs ground level* renders like the ring does.
//!
//! Mechanism: the game's fx attach (`benilla::entities`) spawns one [`GroundFxDecal`] entity per ground quad
//! of a base-anchored instance instead of a mesh child. Each frame ([`update_ground_fx_decals`],
//! in [`crate::billboard::BillboardPlace`] — post-propagation, like the cards), the quad's four
//! authored corners are posed through its live joint × the bone's inverse bindpose (exactly the
//! skinned-vertex path, so the authored slide/spin/scale animation is preserved); when the posed
//! corners moved (0733 §5 — the ShadowKey treatment; a static pose costs a compare), a
//! projection frame is fitted to the posed rectangle and the ground triangles inside it are
//! re-emitted with the quad's own UVs bilerped across the frame — the crescent drapes the
//! terrain it crosses. The cached triangles are pushed onto the shared effect stream every
//! frame with the part's authored identity riding the draw record: its blend
//! ([`crate::particles::buffer::EffectBlend::from_model`]), its `0x70baf0` fog policy, its
//! M2Color RGB loop and `MatAnim` alpha loop sampled into the vertex tint at push time (the old
//! path's per-instance material clones and their per-frame mutations are gone). A decal
//! despawns when its joint does (the effect instance's reap/self-termination), the billboard
//! cards' orphan rule; it pushes nothing when no receiving surface is in the box (mid-air), the
//! ring's no-ground gate.
