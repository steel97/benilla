//! The underwater **drift cloud** — the 4000-mote field the reference draws while the camera eye
//! is inside a liquid (decision 1814).
//!
//! Ground truth: wow-re `system/lighting/scratch/drift-cloud-emission-law.md`, a §5 six-worker
//! round commissioned for this build, plus the difftested kernel transcription in wow-re
//! `crates/lighting/src/drift.rs`. The object is `World.cpp`'s own — `0xfa40` bytes from
//! `0x66f971`, ctor `0x68e5a0`, held by the pointer `[0xc63180]` — and it is **not** part of the
//! weather manager `[0xc6326c]`: the two share no state and no code (verified by complete
//! enumeration; 12 references to the cloud, none in the CMapWeather band).
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! 4000 records of 16 bytes — `xyz` **camera-relative**, plus a per-particle billboard edge. They
//! sit in a 30 yd cube centred on the eye and are advected by `p += (last_cam − cam) + gust`, each
//! axis wrapped back into `±15`: the cloud is therefore **world-fixed** apart from the gust, and
//! the wrap recycles a mote the moment it leaves the box. Nothing is spawned or killed — there is
//! no lifetime, no emitter, and no per-particle recycle; the whole field is re-scattered only on a
//! liquid-type change or a teleport.
//!
//! Both drive sites — the advect `0x66fee0` and the draw `0x6701e0` — carry the same two
//! conjuncts: the render-flag bit `[0xc7b2a4] & 0x2000000` and `[0xc7f288] != 0xf`, the
//! **camera-eye** liquid type. That second one is [`Underwater`], which benilla's murk already
//! gates on, so the motes appear exactly when the murk does.
//!
//! ## Where it draws
//!
//! `0x483731`, between the ground-target reticle's liquid pass and the glare dispatch — after the
//! water surface **and** both M2 transparent passes, i.e. the last world content in the frame.
//! [`Rung::DRIFT_CLOUD`](crate::sky_order::Rung::DRIFT_CLOUD) is that slot on our ladder.
//!
//! Render state is unusually plain: alpha blend, depth test on, **depth write off**, lighting off,
//! immediate `0xFFFFFFFF` white, and fog **off** for water/ocean (on only for magma). No
//! LightParams value reaches a mote — the draw contains zero indirect calls and the colour is a
//! compile-time immediate — so the motes are full-brightness texels over the fogged scene and take
//! **no** underwater tint. That is worth stating because it is the opposite of the obvious guess.
//!
//! ## Where we knowingly differ from the bytes
//!
//! Four places, each a deliberate call rather than a gap — the reasoning is in decision 1814:
//!
//! 1. **[`GUST_REF_HZ`]** — the reference's water gust is a per-*frame* displacement with no `dt`
//!    term, so its drift speed scales with frame rate. We normalise it to 60 fps.
//! 2. **Atlas cell 12 is completed.** The reference's UV initialiser stops two floats early and
//!    one magma mote in four draws a sprite smeared across the atlas diagonal — a shipped defect
//!    ([`ATLAS`]).
//! 3. **The cell walk has no off-by-one.** The reference reads its cell index at the *bottom* of
//!    the draw loop, so the value lands on the next mote and slot 0 takes a hardcoded cell 8.
//! 4. **The cull cone is floored at the frustum** ([`cull_limits`]) — its hardcoded 90° contains
//!    the view at every aspect the reference shipped for, and stops doing so around 21:9.
