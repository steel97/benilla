//! Liquid (water) rendering: the animated lake/river/ocean surfaces the reference draws over MCLQ
//! geometry. The parse + flat mesh live in `benilla_formats::liquid` (built into each `ChunkMesh.liquid`
//! by the terrain loader); this is the Bevy render glue — one shared [`LiquidMaterial`] per
//! [`LiquidKind`], a `texture_2d_array` of its animated frames, and a 24 fps frame-index cycler.
//!
//! **This is the ADT path, and we render WMO liquid through it too — which is wrong.** The reference
//! has three liquid renderers, not one: ADT MCLQ (below), WMO MLIQ water (`0x6b62e0` category 0,
//! split again into exterior `0x6b6630` / interior `0x6b6420` on the group's `MOGP.flags & 0x48` —
//! one texture stage, no depth ramp, alpha from a per-vertex authored byte), and magma/slime. The
//! `wmo_liquid_arms` census sizes them: 30 exterior water groups (Stormwind's canals) against 134
//! interior (every dungeon pool, Blackfathom's included). Neither is what this file implements.
//! Recorded in wow-re `terrain/scratch/water-shading-law.md`.
//!
//! Faithful ADT model — the combiner is an **asset**, extracted from `patch.MPQ` and read, not
//! inferred: `Shaders\Pixel\ocean0_s.bls` is `rgb = primary·colorTex.rgb + detailTex.rgb +
//! (secondary+0.25)·detailTex.a`, `alpha = colorTex.a`, with `0.25` its own scalar `PARAM`. The
//! formula this module has always carried is right verbatim; its **provenance was not** — the
//! citation here used to name an "apitrace WoW.17 program 159" and a `docs/knowledge/terrain.md`,
//! neither of which exists, and wow-re had the program attributed to a character draw. The body
//! colour is **`primary · waterTint`**, where:
//! - **`waterTint`** is a **64-row byte-space ramp** between the zone's dedicated `Light.dbc` water
//!   rows, RAW (no ×0.711): IntBand rows 16/17 (river/lake) or 14/15 (ocean), shallow→deep, by the
//!   per-vertex depth `V` (river/lake `V = clamp(byte/42)`, VERIFIED `c81768`/`FUN_0068d790`; saturates
//!   ~5 yd so the channel middle reaches the deep/teal row). `FUN_0068a830` builds it as an exact
//!   integer accumulator — `row(i) = c0 + floor(i·(c1−c0)/64)`, `i = 0..63` — so it **never reaches
//!   the deep endpoint**, and it is sampled LINEAR/CLAMP at texel `V·64 − 0.5`. **The ocean's last
//!   row alone is then darkened** `floor(0.9·byte)` per channel (an HSV `V ×= 0.9` that reduces to
//!   exactly that) with its alpha forced opaque — and ~80 % of the world's ocean vertices sample
//!   that one row, so it is the open sea's actual colour (decision 2074). The swatch is rebuilt **per world frame**,
//!   not baked once at bootstrap: the dirty flags `[0xc8117c]`/`[0xc81b70]` clear at
//!   `0x680b90`/`0x680b97` and refill via `0x58acd0`, so colour and opacity track the zone and the
//!   clock. (The earlier "reflected sky × 0.711 via `FUN_0068c250`" model fingered the WRONG builder —
//!   a separate grey edge texture never bound on the water unit; and `byte/255` was the wrong LUT →
//!   river never went teal. The `FUN_0068a830` attribution this line used to carry was also wrong:
//!   wow-re reads `0x68a830` as a sky-band row fill.)
//! - **`primary`** is the lit vertex colour `clamp(ambient + N·L·sun)`.
//! - the animated `lake_a`/`ocean_h` frame is the **`detailTex`** (near-black RGB + ripple alpha): a
//!   faint flat lift + an achromatic shimmer on crests — NOT the body colour. Mipped + 16× aniso so the
//!   ripple averages out at distance (near-field samples mip 0, so near sparkle is the term itself).
//! - **opacity** = the SAME `V` indexes both colour and alpha (one swatch row → RGB + A): the same
//!   64-row ramp between
//!   the LightParams shallow/deep alphas — river 0.5→1.0, ocean 0.75→1.0. The river channel reaches
//!   α=1.0 (opaque, deep teal) by byte 42 ≈ 5 yd; the shore stays see-through (the pale edge band —
//!   the bottom shows). The linear ramp is right, and `0xc7fbc0`'s `1.6·(i/63)^8` — which this line
//!   used to flag as a competing reading — is **not on this path at all**: its only consumer is
//!   `0x68c250` (via `0x68c4a0`) building the separate texture `[0xc7fbb8]`, bound at `0x685257`
//!   inside a branch proven **dead** (`[0xc800ec]` is BSS whose only writer stores 0 and which is
//!   never a `0x58b2b0` out-param target, so both arms are controlled). It is the sky/overlay glare
//!   falloff, not a liquid opacity curve. The swatch's alpha column is the same endpoint lerp its RGB
//!   is (`0x68a830`). VERIFIED, wow-re's §5 ocean round — `terrain/scratch/ocean-depth-ramp-law.md`.
//!
//! **Each kind reads its own depth LUT, and both are verified** — `FUN_0068c4c0` builds them side by
//! side and the two vert-fills read them the same way, `tc0 = (0.5, ramp[depthByte])`: river/lake
//! `c81768 = min(d/42, 1)` (`FUN_0068d790`, `fld` @`0x68d818`), ocean `c7fcd8 = min(d/255, 1)`
//! (`FUN_0068d690`, `fld` @`0x68d718`). Putting the river's `/42` on a river was the 2026-05-31 fix;
//! the ocean's `/255` was never the same mistake, and calling it a placeholder was ours, not the
//! binary's — `0x68d890`, the address that claim rested on, is the **magma** vert-fill (authored
//! per-vertex texcoords × 3/256), as `benilla_adt::LiquidVertex::texcoords` has always said.
//! The two divisors differ because the two authored depth bytes do: measured over every MCLQ block in
//! Azeroth + Kalimdor, the sea's byte ramps **1.72 byte/yd** against a river's **8.96**, so `/255`
//! saturates at ~148 yd of depth and `/42` at ~4.7 yd — within ~15 % of each other in yards per unit
//! of V — and 83.4 % of ocean vertices are pinned at byte 255 outright, so the open sea is authored
//! fully deep and the ramp is a shore band. Decision 2069;
//! `benilla-formats::examples::liquid_depth_census` is the instrument, `WOW_OCEAN_DEPTH_DIV` the A/B.
//! (Earlier cuts: ripple-as-colour → black; `×8` → "deep too early"; FLAT colour → "completely gone";
//! sky × 0.711 → wrong builder; `byte/255` on the RIVER → wrong LUT, no teal centre. Faithful =
//! rows 14–17 raw lerp + the /42 V on rivers, the /255 V on the sea.)
//!
//! Two-sided, alpha-blended, depth-write off (Bevy's transparent pass = the verified MCLQ water render
//! state).
//!
//! The frame-flip is the client's first render animation — a deliberate **one-off** (a frame-index
//! uniform off Bevy real `Time`), NOT a general animation system. Two clocks: animation =
//! wall-clock; day/night = server game-time.

//! ## Layout
//!
//! Three concerns, so three files behind this face:
//!
//! * [`query`] — **where the liquid is, and whether you are in it.** The world-space grid every
//!   surface publishes ([`WaterChunkInfo`]), the position queries the swim/sound/foam/lighting
//!   systems ask it ([`liquid_at`], [`water_surface_at`]), and the per-frame camera submersion
//!   verdict ([`Underwater`]). Nothing here renders.
//! * [`spatial`] — **which surfaces are near an XY**, without walking them all: the grid-hash
//!   [`WaterIndex`] the per-draw consumers (the water-plane interleave's three lanes) pre-filter
//!   through. The once-a-frame askers keep the plain walk.
//! * [`surface`] — **the Bevy render glue.** The per-kind animated materials, the two spawn paths
//!   (MCLQ and WMO MLIQ), the flat mesh build, and the 24 fps frame cycler.
//! * [`drift`] — **the underwater drift cloud**: the 4000-mote field the reference draws while the
//!   camera eye is inside a liquid (decision 1814). It is here rather than under `weather` because
//!   the reference keeps it that way too — the pool is CWorld's, not the weather manager's, and
//!   the two share no state and no code — and because [`Underwater`] is its whole trigger.
//!
//! The one cross-feed runs query → lighting: `detect_submersion` publishes WHICH liquid the eye is
//! in, and `lighting::update_time_lighting` selects the whole submerged atmosphere from it.
