//! **Where the liquid is, and whether you are in it** — the geometry side of the liquid subsystem,

//! Every spawned surface publishes its grid in world WoW space ([`WaterChunkInfo`], built by

//! wade splash and footstep depth, the foam lattice, the ambient loops, and the submerged
//! atmosphere — reads it through [`liquid_at`] and its filtered siblings. [`detect_submersion`] is
//! the one cross-feed out of the subsystem: it publishes WHICH liquid the camera eye stands in
//! ([`Underwater`]), and `lighting::update_time_lighting` selects the whole submerged atmosphere
