//! **The Bevy render glue** — the animated liquid surfaces themselves.
//!
//! One shared material per (kind, [`LiquidPath`], scroll) over a `texture_2d_array` of the kind's
//! frames, the two spawn paths (an ADT chunk's MCLQ and a WMO group's MLIQ), and the flat mesh build. The faithful
//! shading model is `super`'s header and `liquid.wgsl`'s; the *position* side — the grid each
//! spawned surface publishes and the queries against it — is [`super::query`].
//!
//! **The 24 fps frame-flip and the lava scroll are computed IN the shader off `globals.time`**
//! (liquid.wgsl `anim_time`): both are pure functions of the wall clock and two per-material
//! constants baked at build, so no CPU ever mutates a liquid material again. The 24 Hz
//! `Assets::get_mut` cycler this replaced cost a measured 0.28 cpu_ms/frame at the SW pin (the
//! WOW_NO_LIQUID_ANIM bracket, 2026-08-18, negative in all three rounds): its per-tick Modified
//! chain re-uploaded ~14 material uniforms, rebuilt their Metal bind groups, and armed the
//! whole-population `AssetChanged` walks 24 times a second. A deterministic run bakes the freeze
//! at BUILD time (`anim.w = 0` → the shader clock reads 0 forever), so captures keep frame 0 /
//! scroll 0 bit-exactly — the same pin the old tick enforced (0600). Two clocks, unchanged in
//! spirit: animation = wall clock; day/night = server game-time.

    /// * **Ironforge is the two-sided case, and it is why the director's report needed a location.**
    ///   Eleven magma groups: **9 at nibble 2 (static)** and **2 at nibble 6 (scrolling)**, plus 2
    ///   still-water groups. Lava that moves and lava that does not, in the same forge.
    /// * **Blackrock Mountain — the pin behind `blackrock_lava_is_below_the_feet_not_above_it`** —
    ///   is nibble 6 throughout, in the outer mountain and both instance WMOs. All of it creeps.
    /// * **Slime splits the same way**: Undercity's 38 canals are nibble 3 and stand still;
    ///   Stratholme's are nibble 7 and flow.
