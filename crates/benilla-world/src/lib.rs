//! **benilla-world** — the world renderer, with no game attached.
//!
//! Decision 1160's crate. The line it draws: *this crate can put something into a world and answer
//! questions about that world; it knows nothing about a session, a wire, an avatar or a UI.* What
//! enforces the line is not this doc — it is the dependency edge. `benilla-world` does not depend
//! on `benilla-app`, so a name that crosses back is a compile error rather than a lint, and
//! `benilla-worldview` links only this crate, so an engine that quietly needs the game stops
//! booting rather than quietly working.
//!
//! Above it: `benilla-app` (the game — session, wire, units, UI) and the two binaries.
//! Below it: `benilla-assets` (the asset foundation both sides share) and `benilla-formats`.
//!
//! **One instrument travels with the engine and three do not**, and the rule that sorts them is
//! whether `WorldPlugins` registers it. `art_scope` does — within-map art residency is engine
//! behaviour, not a readout — so it is here. The debug panel, the perf journal and the pipeline
//! warmer are registered by the game, and every one of them reads the game (units, targets, names,
//! the UI): they are instruments *above* the stack, and the compiler said so the moment the move
//! was attempted with them inside. That is the whole value of the crate edge over a naming
//! convention — the earlier module-name-based wall had them excluded by an assumption, and the
//! assumption was wrong.
