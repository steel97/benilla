//! **macOS `Cmd+Q`, turned into an exit the client can see** (decision 1528).
//!
//! On every other exit the client gets a frame to write the player's session down — the shutdown
//! systems run in `Last`, after the `AppExit` (`benilla_app::shutdown`). `Cmd+Q` gets none.
//!
//! The gesture is winit's own default menu bar: `menu.rs` builds an app menu whose *Quit* item is
//! wired straight to AppKit's `terminate:` (`applicationDidFinishLaunching`, and only when
//! `default_menu` is on — bevy_winit 0.18 leaves it on and exposes no
//! `EventLoopBuilderExtMacOS` hook to turn it off). `terminate:` runs
//! `applicationWillTerminate:`, which closes every window and calls winit's `internal_exit()` →
//! `LoopExiting` → `bevy_winit`'s `exiting()`, which clears the world. **No `app.update()` happens
//! anywhere in that sequence**, so there is no schedule for a shutdown system to run in and no
//! `AppExit` for one to read. Measured on the real client, in the world: `Cmd+Q` wrote nothing —
//! not the flat saved variables, not one addon's `saved/*.lua`, not `AddOns.txt`, not the camera
//! pose, not `config.toml`.
//!
//! The fix is the one winit itself points at: *"The menubar initialization should be before the
//! `NewEvents` event, to allow overriding of the default menu even if it's created."* We re-point
//! that one item at **`performClose:`**, so `Cmd+Q` becomes the window close — which Bevy already
//! models end to end (`WindowCloseRequested` → `close_when_requested` → `exit_on_all_closed` →
//! `AppExit` in `PostUpdate` → our `Last` shutdown tail → a clean exit). For a single-window game
//! *quit* and *close the window* are the same act, so nothing is lost by making them the same
//! code path; what is gained is that the gesture a macOS player reaches for first stops eating
//! their settings.
//!
//! `setTarget(nil)` sends it down the responder chain, so the key window handles it — the same
//! route the red close button takes. Everything here is a no-op off macOS.
