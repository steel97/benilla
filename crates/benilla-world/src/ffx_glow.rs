//! The faithful **FFXGlow** post pass (decision 0158) — the reference's full-screen glow
//! (`FFXEffects.cpp` / `FFXGlow.bls`), replacing the Bevy-`Bloom` approximation and its two
//! eye-tuned constants.
//!
//! Pipeline (all byte-grounded — the shipped ARB programs + wow-re's `ffxeffects` T3 node):
//! scene → ½ → ¼ downsample (dims floored at 8, `ffx_compute_rt_dims`) → separable Gauss4
//! (weights ⅛ ⅜ ⅜ ⅛, shipped constants) → `out = screen + w·blur²` in gamma bytes, `w` = the
//! per-zone `LightParams.glow` weight (authored data; the ONLY input, no knobs). The gamma-space
//! byte math and the square-law are in `shaders/ffx_glow.wgsl`.
//!
//! This is the frame's sole glow pass — it won the A/B against Bevy's `Bloom`, and that fallback
//! (plus its debug toggle) is gone. Applied to both the world camera and the portrait-booth bake
//! cameras (`portrait::mod`): the booth rides the same final node so its bake reads at exact world
//! parity, the FFXGlow combine owning the frame's ONE gamma decode.
//!
//! **What a bake does NOT inherit.** The node's two other lanes are keyed on the *viewer's own
//! state*, not on the scene — the drunk/underwater haze and the ghost's FFXDeath combine — and the
//! reference runs its FFX pass inside the WorldFrame's paint, with every UI frame compositing
//! afterwards. [`FfxGlow::state_scale`] is that whole class in one field, `0` on every bake
//! (decision 1481).
//!
//! **Two nodes since decision 2234.** The world view's node runs the three filter passes and,
//! for a view nobody claims, the combine where [`crate::final_pass`] says. The player-UI camera
//! claims the world view ([`FfxBackdrop`]) and draws the combine itself, first in its own main
//! pass, straight into its byte target: the world enters the interface's buffer with no picture
//! in between — no full-window float image written by one camera and read back by the next.
