//! **Where a colour lane's final pass lands** (decision 2206) — the one rule the FFXGlow combine
//! ([`crate::ffx_glow`]) and the UI gamma decode (`benilla_app::ui_gamma`) share.
//!
//! Each of benilla's two colour lanes ends in a full-screen pass that owns the frame's one gamma
//! decode (0161 for the world, 0254 for the UI). Bevy's default for a camera is
//! [`CameraOutputMode::Write`]: that pass writes the view's main texture, and bevy's `upscaling`
//! node then **blits** the result into the camera's target — a pure copy of every pixel, once per
//! camera. On the Windows lab's RTX that copy was the costliest pass of the frame (2205: `upscaling`
//! 1.1–1.4 ms of a 4.3 ms GPU frame, both cameras' blits summed), and on a tile GPU it is one more
//! full-screen pass on the render thread 1975 called the floor.
//!
//! With the camera set to [`CameraOutputMode::Skip`] the blit is off, and the lane's final pass
//! renders **straight into the target** — a `Skip` bake's combine into its image, the UI camera's
//! decode into the swapchain. Same shader, same values, one full-screen pass fewer per camera;
//! the pipeline is specialised on the target's format because that is now the format it writes.
//! (The world camera's combine no longer lands anywhere of its own: since decision 2234 it is
//! the first draw of the UI camera's main pass, `ffx_glow::FfxBackdrop`, and the world's target is a size-carrier
//! nothing writes — so a claimed world view never resolves a destination at all.) The first use of the output in a frame is a clear rather than a load: a fast clear on an
//! immediate-mode GPU, and on a tile GPU the difference between not reading the old contents and
//! reading them — the fullscreen triangle covers every pixel of the viewport either way.
//!
//! A `Write` camera keeps the ping-pong ([`ViewTarget::post_process_write`]) and the blit, exactly
//! as before: a bake's own `clear_color` and viewport (the glue booth's pillarbox, 1619) are the
//! blit's to honour, and `benilla-worldview` has no reason to change. So the choice is the camera's
//! — made where the camera is spawned — and a node only reads it. **The one hazard is the
//! half-way state:** a `Skip` camera whose final pass never ran presents a target nothing wrote.
//! That is why `$WOW_NO_FFX` (`ffx_glow::ensure_ffx_glow`) strips the glow and keeps the combine.
