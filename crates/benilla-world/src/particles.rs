//! Faithful M2 particle emitters — the visible fire/glow of campfires, torches, braziers and candles.
//!
//! The 1.12 client simulates particles on the CPU and draws them as camera-facing, additive quads; we
//! do the same (the GPU never touched the legacy particle path, and a CPU sim is the only way to match
//! the integrator exactly — see decision 0014). Each [`ParticleEmitter`] owns a small pool of live
//! particles: every frame we age + integrate the pool, then expand each live particle into a
//! camera-facing quad written into the **shared effect-quad stream** ([`buffer::EffectQuads`],
//! decision 0732 slice P1 — one CPU vertex vec + one GPU upload for the whole family, drawn by
//! the dedicated lane in [`render`]; per-emitter `Mesh`/material assets are gone, and with them
//! the per-frame allocator churn they priced). Every cloud is **anchored to its MODEL's live
//! position** (the reference rebuilds the
//! draw matrix with `translate(−emitterPos)` each frame — a moving model carries its flame, no
//! world-frozen trails) while the emitter's BONE composes only each particle's birth: bone motion
//! is baked per particle (an emitter orbiting on an animated bone — the food sparkle's global-
//! sequence spin — births a moving ring of straight risers, never a swirling cloud; the client's
//! only live-follow plumbing is file flag `0x4000`, unauthored by our content). File flag `0x10`
//! additionally folds the live bone ROTATION at render instead of baking it at birth —
//! byte-verified, wow-re `part-simspace-fields.md` + its `1f40db0b` corrections. The lane's
//! fragment does the vanilla gamma-space combine (`shaders/wow_effect.wgsl`, decisions
//! 0152/0161). The whole effect family — particles, ribbons, the decal family, water foam,
//! precipitation — draws through the lane; `WowParticleMaterial` retired with slice P2 (0733).
//!
//! Over-life colour (incl. the alpha that is the additive weight), size and texture-cell are sampled
//! from the parsed [`benilla_formats::OverLife`] ramp by the particle's normalized age.
