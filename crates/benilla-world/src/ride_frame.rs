//! The **ride frame** — `[CM2Model+0x17c]`, the world matrix of the transport a model is riding.
//!
//! A world-mode particle cloud (`0x10` CLEAR) and *every* ribbon trail store their committed
//! content in absolute coordinates and never re-apply a live matrix to it. That is what makes a
//! trail: run past a torch and the smoke hangs where it was born. On a **transport** the same
//! rule would stream a rider's effects off the stern, so the reference stores them in the
//! transport's frame instead and re-projects them live at draw. The mechanism is one matrix
//! entering at exactly two sites, and they are inverses (wow-re
//! `system/models/scratch/attach-matrix-is-the-transport-matrix.md`, §5 trio + orchestrator
//! arbitration; benilla decision 1591, which named this gap and left it unbuilt):
//!
//! ```text
//! A = translate(transport.pos) · Rz(transport.facing)    // 0x630ac0 — position and Z-facing only
//!   = NULL for a model not riding anything
//!
//! BIRTH  0x7b5160:  rt+0x1fc = srcMx · A⁻¹      (A ≠ 0 and 0x100 CLEAR; else verbatim)
//! DRAW   0x7b3d20:  0xcf5b68 = A · T · S        (0x100 CLEAR, [ebp+8] ≠ 0; else T·S)
//! EDGE   0x7187f0:  on A changing NULL↔non-NULL, re-express every ALREADY-LIVE particle's
//!                   position and velocity (0x7b5e60) and every ribbon's (0x7b7bc0)
//! ```
//!
//! So a rider's effects are *stored* on the deck and *drawn* through the deck's live pose — they
//! hang still relative to the deck, and boarding or leaving re-expresses the cloud instead of
//! snapping it. The residual over a particle's life is exactly `A(t₀)⁻¹·A(t₁)`: the **transport's**
//! motion since birth, never the host unit's own.
//!
//! **Where `A` lives.** On the MODEL, not the bone and not the emitter — and the reference copies
//! the parent's pointer down to every child model each frame (`0x7142c1`, inside `m2_animate`), so
//! a held weapon's enchant streamer inherits its wearer's transport without knowing anything about
//! it. Our model child list is [`crate::model_fade::ParentModel`], so [`RideFrames`] walks that
//! same chain — one component on the rider, inherited by everything hung off it.
