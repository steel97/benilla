//! The **WMO skybox** — the authored sky a building swaps in for the `Light.dbc` gradient dome while
//! the camera stands in one of its own groups.
//!
//! A WMO root can name a skybox model in its **MOSB** chunk, and a group can ask for it with group
//! flag **`0x40000`**. Both halves matter, and the flag is tested **on the groups the portal flood
//! REACHES, never on the group the camera stands in** — `0x6b42e0` sits inside the flood `0x6b41c0`
//! with `ebx` = the group being *visited*, seeded from the containment list on the inside leg and
//! from every frustum-visible EXTERIOR group on the outside leg (`0x6b3dd0`), recursing through
//! portals at `0x6b4639` and re-testing at each step. The predicate is therefore
//! *"any flood-reached group carries the bit, and the root names a MOSB"*, published to `[0xca8080]`
//! and read once at `0x681282`.
//!
//! **That distinction is load-bearing, and getting it wrong is what shipped first.** In Stratholme's
//! King's Square the camera stands in group 39 — the root's *only* EXTERIOR (`0x8`) group, which does
//! **not** set `0x40000`. A containing-group test draws no skybox there; the reference draws the
//! painted red sky, because 61 of the 83 groups its flood reaches from group 39 do carry the bit.
//! (Checked on the asset: a BFS over `Stratholme_B`'s MOPR reaches 82 of 83 groups from group 39.)
//! The corpus correlation that seeded the first attempt — across all 815 roots the bit never appears
//! without a MOSB, 0 counter-examples (`benilla-extract skyboxscan`) — was true and still is; it just
//! never established *which* group the renderer tests, and it was over-read as if it had.
//!
//! Five roots exercise both halves: the four Caverns of Time shells (unreleased in 1.12) and
//! **`Stratholme_B`**, the burning city. Four more name a skybox no group ever asks for (DireMaul's
//! instance shell, `Stratholme_A`, and the two Sunken Temple roots — whose MOSB isn't even a model
//! path, it's the string "the temple of atal'hakkar"), so keying off the chunk alone would still
//! paint skies the reference never shows. This is why Stratholme's sky is red where the zone light
//! says otherwise: map 329's only reachable `Light.dbc` atmosphere (global row 341 → `LightParams`
//! 336) is a khaki-brown gradient with a near-black apex, and it is not what draws in there.
//!
//! What we draw is the model as authored: `StratholmeSkybox.m2` is a static, emissive, two-sided cube
//! (three batches × 8 verts, one texture pair per axis), anchored at the camera with identity rotation
//! — the same treatment [`crate::sky`] gives its dome. Occlusion is **not** the box's radius: like
//! every sky element it forces the far depth (`wmo_skybox.wgsl`; the law is in [`crate::sky_order`]),
//! so the world paints over it and the 26-yard shell is free to sit inside the room's own geometry.
//!
//! **Scope — the skybox replaces the WHOLE celestial pass, not just the backdrop.** `CSky::Render`
//! carries one shared boolean (`0x6d49cd` sets it, `0x6d49fb`/`0x6d4a2e` clear it once any slot's
//! weight exceeds `[0x808aac]` = 0.99) and `0x6d4a3b test edi,edi; je` skips **all six** element
//! draws together — stars, sun disc, both moons, gradient band and cloud dome. There is no
//! per-element gating. Confirmed in a live GL capture of the reference standing in King's Square:
//! the entire `[0.975, 0.98]` sky slice is three `count=12` draws (the cube's three texture pairs)
//! and nothing else, identically in every frame. Only the **glare** quads survive — they render on
//! their own later path (`0x483740 → 0x6d48c0 → 0x7e57e0`), outside this pass.
//!
//! What the atmosphere drives (fog colour and distance, ambient, diffuse) is still untouched: no byte
//! law says the flag reaches it, and the reference fogs the world normally underneath the painted sky.
