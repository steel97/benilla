//! Entity ground-shade (decision 0173): units, players, and GameObjects sample the terrain MCSH under
//! them **dynamically** and dim their sun term when standing in baked ground shadow — the fold-back of
//! wow-re's byte-verified §8a/§9 verdict (`models/scratch/m2-interior-doodad-base-light`): a spawned
//! unit/player/GameObject carries the SAME 2.5-lit / 0.5-MCSH-shadowed chain as an ADT doodad, driven by
//! a per-frame MCSH sample at the object's node position and a linear intensity ramp (`0x69e770`, the
//! step constant `[0x810808] = 3.3333`/s), not a static spawn-time bake.
//!
//! **The chain applies to units, and 0814 restored it after 0809 wrongly took it away.** The reference
//! has TWO real delivery states for a unit's committed light, and which one a given unit is in is a
//! *lifecycle* fact, not a category fact. Delivery splits at `0x672a20`: with `[model+0x3c0] != 0` the
//! node applies (`0x6a7300` multiplies the diffuse by the ramped `[+0xa4]` — the 2.5/0.5 chain this
//! file models); with `[model+0x3c0] == 0` the null fallback commits the raw day/night pair with no
//! intensity multiply at all — a hardwired ×1.0, position-independent, never sampling MCSH.
//! Registration fires on a model-set with the node present (`Node::SetModel 0x6716f0` ←
//! `0x613cf0`/`0x613d80`: equip / display-id / shapeshift); node birth (`0x670db0` from Activate
//! `0x613e10`) passes model arg 0, so its birth-time registration gate `670fca` is skipped and a unit
//! is born UNREGISTERED.
//!
//! **We model REGISTERED, because that is the steady state of anything we draw.** Every unit benilla
//! renders has had its display model applied — which is exactly the node-present model-set that
//! registers it — so unregistered is the pre-display transient, not the resting state. wow-re's own
//! two frames bracket this and disagree with each other: a standing Stormwind player commits **×2.5**
//! (registered, MCSH-lit) while a running Northshire player commits ×1.0
//! (`unit-mcsh-shadow-target.md` §4). Their note marks the discriminant **Open** and hands it to us as
//! a benilla-side observable — so a single hardwired value cannot be read off it in either direction,
//! and 0809 read off the ×1.0 half. The director's eye settles the tie the way the ×2.5 frame does: a
//! character standing in shade reads visibly dimmer than one in sun, and flattening that was wrong.
//!
//! The null fallback is therefore real, verified, and **deliberately not modelled** — see 0814. If we
//! ever want it, it is a lifecycle flag flipped by the display-model apply, never a per-kind constant.
//!
//! Structure mirrors the reference's one-light-node-per-object: [`GroundShade`] lives on the **net
//! entity root** (the `[obj+0xe0]` twin), sampled at the root's feet and ramped there; the resulting
//! shade byte is written to every M2 part in the root's descendant tree — body submeshes, and held
//! items/helm/shoulders hanging off joint entities — via the `MeshTag` shade field (`mesh_tag`), so a
//! weapon dims with its wielder rather than sampling independently at the hand (the real client lights
//! attachments from the owner's node; independent sampling would flicker at shadow edges mid-swing).
//!
//! Interplay: the interior classifier ([`crate::interior`]) owns a part's tag while it stands in a WMO
//! room (packed floor colour — no sun indoors, so no shade either); this system skips those parts and
//! runs after the classifier to re-assert the byte over its exterior reclaim. Fades own the alpha field
//! only (they write through `with_alpha`), so shade rides through appear/despawn/zoom feathering.
