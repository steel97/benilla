//! The owned skin palette (decision 0720): benilla computes every skinned rig's joint palette
//! itself and uploads it to a region of the shared light buffer; `wow_model.wgsl`'s vertex stage
//! skins from it. This replaces Bevy's `SkinnedMesh` lane end to end — `extract_skins`'
//! world-wide `Changed<GlobalTransform>` sweep and `prepare_skins`' full-staging-buffer rewrite
//! (both O(everything), measured in decision 0718) become no-ops because no entity carries
//! `SkinnedMesh` anymore (and no mesh carries Bevy's joint attributes, so the `SKINNED`
//! pipeline path never compiles).
//!
//! The shape mirrors the interior-prop probe table (`lighting::prop_probes`), the house pattern:
//! a main-world slab ([`RigPalettes`]) whose slots free themselves through a component hook
//! ([`RigSkin`]'s `on_replace`), `Arc`-shared rows so the render-world extract is a pointer bump,
//! and a `PrepareResources` upload that writes only what changed — here per-rig **dirty ranges**
//! (a parked, stationary rig re-uploads nothing) plus the slot table on allocation changes.
//!
//! **Palettes are RIG-RELATIVE** (decision 0974): row `b` of rig `r` is
//! `rig_from_joint(b) × inverse_bindpose(b)`, where `rig_from_joint` is the joint's world frame
//! with the rig's own world origin subtracted off — same 3×3 as Bevy's `skin_model` would
//! produce, translation measured from the rig root instead of the map's. The origin itself rides
//! a parallel per-slot table ([`rig_origin_region_offset`]), and the vertex stage
//! adds it back **camera-relative**, so a vertex never exists as an absolute world coordinate in
//! f32. That is the whole point: at Elwynn's ~9.5 k-yard coordinates one f32 ULP is ~1 mm, the
//! bone chain and the palette each spend one, and because the pose is recomposed every frame the
//! rounding is *fresh noise every frame* — the long-standing character shimmer. Rig-relative
//! numbers are ~1 yard, where an ULP is ~0.1 µm. (Rows stay 3 `vec4`s — the affine's rows; the
//! fourth is implicit `[0,0,0,1]`.)
//!
//! The vertex stage reads the part's rig slot from its `MeshTag` rig field (`mesh_tag::rig_bits`),
//! resolves the rig's base bone index through the slot table, and blends the four indexed bones'
//! rows by the vertex weights — replacing (not composing with) the mesh's world matrix, exactly
//! like Bevy skinning, then offsets by `origin − camera`.
//!
//! Both writers keep the convention — the collapsed lane ([`RigPalettes::write_rig_worlds`]) is
//! handed frames already composed from a zero-translation root, so its rows are exact; the entity
//! lane ([`RigPalettes::write_rig`]) subtracts the holder's world translation off globals Bevy
//! propagated in absolute space, so its rows inherit whatever rounding propagation already spent
//! (a named residual — killing it needs a floating origin, not a palette change).
//!
//! **Dirtiness is structural, not assumed**: every joint entity carries a [`RigJoint`] marker
//! (planted by [`spawn_joints`]), and [`compute_rig_palettes`] runs one linear
//! `Changed<GlobalTransform>` pass over exactly those entities — so *every* writer of a joint's
//! world pose (the 0712 evaluator, the body twist, global-sequence channels, the billboard joint
//! pass, a mount's seat, the terrain-conform node, plain movement) marks its rig by construction.
//! The pass is rig-scoped (≈ the bone population), unlike the Bevy sweep it replaces (the whole
//! world); Stage B of 0720 replaces it with writer-driven dirtying when the bone entities
//! themselves collapse.
