//! The doodad animation host (decision 0130, phase 1) — world-placed M2 doodads (ADT MDDF + WMO MODD
//! props) animate: flags wave, windmills turn, flame bones jiggle.
//!
//! Byte ground (wow-5875-re `system/animation/scratch/doodad-anim-host.md`, VERIFIED): a doodad's M2
//! instance is armed at load — bone 0, animation id 0, `linkFlag=1` — and then **re-arms itself every
//! play-window, for ever**, rolling a fresh frequency-weighted variation each time (§5, decision
//! 0768: the watchdog `0x719370` fires on `now ≥ windowHi`, enqueues the doodad-only completion
//! callback `0x6951b0` that `0x695100` installed at `[model+0x70]`, and that callback re-runs op4
//! with `variationIdx = -1`, which writes the next `windowHi` and clears the latch — self-sustaining).
//! **Global sequences loop with zero arming**, clock-driven. The cycle is gated on **linkage** — the
//! per-frame walk `0x7074b0` only advances models spliced into the scene list, which the doodad drain
//! `0x683f80` does per **in-range** doodad — not on the draw, so a doodad behind the camera keeps
//! cycling. Because sampling is clock-indexed (`cursor = clock − startOffset`), a re-appearing model
//! shows the pose the shared clock dictates — pausing costs nothing and drifts nothing.
//!
//! benilla's translation: the spawn site ([`crate::terrain_stream`]) classifies each placed model by
//! [`classify`] — the ~90% with no animated channel stay on today's static path (measured,
//! `benilla-extract doodadscan`) — and an animated one spawns the skinned twin + a collapsed
//! [`RigPose`] buffer (decision 1365 — no joint entities; consumers ride on-demand anchors) on an
//! anim-root entity carrying [`DoodadAnimHost`]: an `AnimationPlayer` on the armed clip,
//! re-rolled every window by [`reroll_doodad_variation`], and/or a [`GlobalSeqDrive`] for the
//! free-running channels. [`gate_doodad_anim`] here is the draw-time tick made explicit: animation
//! runs iff any of the doodad's submeshes is actually drawn (the `Visibility` verdict the debug-panel
//! authority composes from far-clip + the size-bucketed distance fade + the WMO portal cull), and a
//! resume seeks to `(now − armed_at) mod duration` — the ref's shared-clock phase, measured from the
//! current arm. Note the two gates are deliberately different: the *draw* gates the pose, the
//! *linkage* (here: residency) gates the variation cycle.
