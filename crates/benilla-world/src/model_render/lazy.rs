//! **Deferred material realization** — a `WowModelMaterial` becomes an *asset* the first frame
//! something drawable is bound to it, not the moment a spawner builds it.
//!
//! Why: every material asset costs the GPU lane real per-frame CPU whether or not it is ever
//! drawn. Bevy's non-bindless `AsBindGroup` gives each material its own bind group and one
//! buffer per `#[uniform]` binding (two for this material), and wgpu's pass encoder allocates
//! and clears usage trackers sized to the device's *live* buffer and texture counts for every
//! render pass it encodes — a per-pass term that scales with residency, not with what is drawn.
//! Measured on the crowd rig (1929's follow-on, the `wgpu_bufs=` census): 9.9k materials,
//! 20.7k buffers and 10.2k bind groups alive at the Stormwind auction house with 36 entity
//! batches drawn, because the batch builder ([`super::batch::M2BatchMaterials`]) hands every
//! spawner its whole variant set — steady, the two interior lanes, their blend twins, the
//! depth-prime twin — and the variants a batch never switches to sat in the store forever.
//!
//! The mechanism: the builder reserves a handle (`Assets::reserve_handle`) and parks the built
//! value here, keyed by the reserved id. [`realize_bound`] walks the bound handles and inserts
//! the asset for every one whose entity is view-visible this frame. A handle every holder has
//! dropped arrives as the store's own `AssetEvent::Unused` (it fires for a reserved id too) and
//! the parked value goes with it. Nothing about the handles changes: a part still stores and
//! swaps `Handle<WowModelMaterial>`s, and every reader that clones a material *before* binding
//! it — the portrait booth's relight twins, a spell kit's per-instance copy, the pipeline
//! warmer — calls [`realize`] first, which is a no-op for an asset that already exists.
//!
//! **The deadline is the store's event PUBLISH, not extraction.** `Assets::insert` does not
//! announce anything: it pushes an `AssetEvent::Added` onto the store's private queue, and
//! `Assets::<A>::asset_events` — scheduled by bevy_asset in **`PostUpdate`** — is what writes
//! that queue into the message stream `extract_render_asset` reads. A sweep placed after it
//! (this module's original `Last`) therefore realizes an asset the render world is not told
//! about until the NEXT frame's publish, and `queue_material_meshes` skips every entity whose
//! material is missing from `RenderAssets` — one frame of the object not drawn. That is
//! invisible for a first bind (nothing was on screen to lose) and plainly visible for a
//! **swap onto an entity that is already drawing**: the appear fade's blend→cutout latch, where
//! a freshly logged-in NPC blinked out for a frame at the instant it finished fading in, and
//! the doodad distance fade's latch and the far-side water twin behind it. Pinned by
//! [`tests::the_sweep_publishes_its_added_in_the_frame_it_realizes`].
//!
//! **So the sweep is the top of `PostUpdate`, and the visibility it reads is last frame's** —
//! not a preference, the only placement bevy's own graph leaves. `AssetEventSystems` is ordered
//! *before* `CalculateBounds`, which is before `CheckVisibility` (bevy_camera's
//! `VisibilityPlugin`), so "after this frame's verdict" and "before the publish" is a cycle; and
//! `reset_view_visibility` (in `VisibilityPropagate`, also before `CheckVisibility`) clears every
//! current bit, so a sweep between the two would read `false` for the whole world. Before both,
//! `ViewVisibility::get` is still the previous frame's answer — which is exactly the right
//! question here: the entity this exists to keep drawing is the one that WAS drawing and had its
//! material swapped under it in `Update`.
//!
//! A binding whose entity was not visible last frame — a fresh spawn, an unparked part, the
//! depth-prime twin `zfill::sync_zfill_twins` spawns in `PostUpdate` — realizes on the next
//! sweep and draws on its second frame. That is what the `Last` placement did too (a
//! just-spawned entity's material was realized on its spawn frame and published on the next),
//! so nothing pays more than before, and everything that swaps pays a frame less.
//!
//! **The table is a process global, deliberately.** It is a side of `Assets<WowModelMaterial>`
//! — "reserved, value parked" — that the asset store has no slot for, and the builder that
//! needs it ([`super::model_material`]) is a free function with a two-dozen-argument signature
//! reached from seven lanes through three caches (the engine's, the streamer's, the warmer's
//! `Local`). Threading one more resource through all of them for what is a property of the
//! store, not of any cache, is the wrong shape; one mutex, locked once per system run, is the
//! right one. Main-world only, like the store it shadows.
