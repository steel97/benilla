///
/// - **`vis=Hidden`** — [`apply_model_visibility`] above said no: a toggle, the far-clip wall, a
///   fully-faded doodad, an `A ≤ 0` material track, the portal PVS or the exterior window gate.
/// - **`vis=Inherited inh=false`** — *this* part said yes and an **ancestor** said no. For a body
///   part that is the exterior-scene election (decision 1270), which is decided once on the net
///   root and inherits down; it is also how a transport hides its deck. Without this field the
///   line was indistinguishable from the frustum case below — the election arrived after the
///   trace did, and a body vanishing for the right reason would have read as a bound bug.
/// - **`vis=Inherited inh=true view=false`** — everything of ours admitted it and **Bevy's frustum
///   cull** dropped it, which means the entity's `Aabb` does not describe what it draws.
///
/// That second line is the whole of decisions 1259 and 1261 — an animated placement whose bound was
/// its bind pose, and then the same bound silently recomputed at the twin swap — and both were
/// diagnosed by reading code because nothing could be asked. `bound=` is printed in **world space**
/// beside the camera, so "the box is nowhere near the bird" is visible directly rather than inferred.
///
/// Off (the env var unset) this system is one `Option` check per frame and no query iteration.
/// Throttled to [`VIS_TRACE_HZ`]; matching is a case-insensitive substring of the `WorldObject`
