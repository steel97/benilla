//! **[`WorldPoint`] — what is at this point, and where is this subject.**
//!
//! One read-only [`SystemParam`] answering the questions a caller asks *of the world* rather than
//! of one of its subsystems: is there liquid here, how high is its surface, whose room does it
//! belong to, what is the eye submerged in, where is the nearest water you can hear.
//!
//! Decision 1164 counted 23 engine items whose only reason for being public was that a gameplay
//! system had to assemble this query by hand — four `Query`s, three `Res`es and six free functions
//! threaded through each other in the right order, re-written at every call site. Assembling a
//! query by hand is also how a call site gets it *wrong*: the "swim in air" family (0634 → 0696 →
//! 0701) is three separate bugs whose common shape was a caller passing the wrong context, and
//! every one of them had to be fixed at N call sites instead of one.
//!
//! **The subject is the parameter, and it is an [`Entity`] or a role — never an engine component.**
//! Before this, a caller asking about a unit had to carry `Option<&UnitWmoRoom>` in its own query
//! and hand it in; the room tracker's component was gameplay API purely because of that. Now the
//! caller says *which unit*, and the world looks up its own bookkeeping. That is the difference
//! between an API and a wiring diagram.
//!
//! **Deliberately not merged with tracing a body through the world** (1164 item 11, `WorldCollision`):
//! `ground_normal_under` reads the physics trimesh and `terrain_height_under` reads the MCNK
//! heightfield, and they answer different questions about "the ground" that are allowed to differ.
//!
//! Two precedents this generalises, one on each side of the line: `surface::SurfaceUnderfoot` and
//! `sun::follow::FlareGate`.
