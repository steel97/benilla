//! The per-instance `MeshTag` channel: **one home for its bit conventions and ownership protocol**
//! (decisions 0066, 0173 — the typed field layout; 0720 — the rig field + the 6-bit alpha).
//!
//! Every `WowModelMaterial` submesh carries a Bevy `MeshTag` (a raw `u32` the shader reads per
//! instance). **Bits 31 and 30 are standalone flags; bits 0..=29 are the payload.** The **rig
//! field** (bits 19..=29) and the **alpha field** (bits 0..=5) mean the same thing in every mode;
//! the bits between them switch meaning on **material state** — so per entity each bit has exactly
//! one meaning at a time:
//!
//! - **Highlight** ([`HIGHLIGHT_BIT`], bit 31): the hover/target model-brighten flag — the shader
//!   adds the client's emissive lift to the lighting sum when set. Orthogonal by construction:
//!   no payload mode ever sets bit 31, and the shader masks it off before reading the payload —
//!   so the untagged-⇒-opaque `0` sentinel still works on the masked value.
//! - **Interior fog** ([`INTERIOR_FOG_BIT`], bit 30): this instance draws with the INTERIOR fog
//!   triple (shared-light rows 18-19) instead of the scene fog. **Two conjuncts, never one**: the
//!   model must stand in a WMO interior (the reference's per-unit classification `0x71c110` →
//!   collector `+0x184..`, lane by `[node+0xc]&2`) *and* the room it attached to must be on the
//!   camera's `[0xca7f00]` chain this frame (`[P+0x98] != 0`, decision 1792 §4). Both writers
//!   below decide it that way — the classifier for entity parts, `apply_model_visibility` for
//!   room-bound WMO content — through [`with_interior_fog`]. Masked off with bit 31 before the
//!   payload decode.
//! - **Instance slot** (bits 19..=29, BOTH payload modes — decisions 0720, 0812, 0820): the
//!   per-instance index into the shared buffer's slot-keyed regions. `0` is the world's shared
//!   no-instance sentinel (terrain, WMO, doodads, clutter, and every part of a rig-less model). Two
//!   consumers, reading it in different stages — which is why it is no longer called "the rig slot":
//!     - the **vertex** stage indexes the skin-palette region with it ([`crate::rig_palette`], 0720)
//!       — but only under `WOW_RIG_SKIN`, which `WowModelExt::specialize` compiles from the **mesh's
//!       own joint attributes**, never from this field. A static mesh carrying a slot is not skinned.
//!     - the **fragment** stage indexes the per-instance body-tint table with it
//!       ([`crate::instance_tint`], 0812) — for every part, skinned or not.
//!
//!   That asymmetry is why the field is written from the **unit** and not from the part: a unit's
//!   boneless geosets, its helm and shoulders, its held items and its billboard cards all carry
//!   their wearer's slot, so a tinted unit tints *whole* — the reference's own rule (an
//!   attached/chained model inherits the parent CM2's computed colours, `0x714000`). Before 0820 the
//!   field was skinning-only, and a dwarf's Stoneform tint stopped at his pauldrons.
//!
//!   Written ONCE at part spawn ([`rig_bits`]); every runtime writer below preserves it by
//!   construction (the `with_*` accessors carry bits the writer doesn't own). 11 bits ⇔
//!   [`MAX_RIG_SLOTS`] concurrent instances.
//! - **Alpha** (bits 0..=5, BOTH payload modes): the fade alpha as a 6-bit fraction (`63` =
//!   opaque), multiplying the cutout alpha. 64 steps is past perceptual for the sub-second fade
//!   ramps that write it (it was u16 pre-0720 — the rig field bought its bits from here). A whole
//!   payload of `0` is the shader's *untagged ⇒ opaque* sentinel, so the alpha field is never
//!   legitimately `0` — a true zero alpha writes `1` (≈0, invisible) instead ([`alpha_bits`]).
//! - **Exterior payload** (the default): bits 6..=13 carry the **ground-shade byte** (`0` = lit,
//!   `255` = fully MCSH-shadowed): the per-instance mix from the batch's lit sun level toward the
//!   shaded one (`wow_model.wgsl`). Entities (units/players/GameObjects) ramp it per frame
//!   ([`crate::entity_shade`]); statics (doodads/props) leave it `0` — their shade is the
//!   per-material selector (`sun_scale.x`). Bits 14..=18 are reserved (0).
//! - **Interior probe slot** (interior M2 props/entities — material in interior mode,
//!   `model_flags.z` set, not a WMO): bits 6..=18 carry the SH-probe TABLE SLOT (see
//!   [`crate::lighting::PropProbes`]; 8192 slots = 13 bits), alpha and rig ride their fixed
//!   fields — so a fade (the self-avatar zoom feather, a despawn ramp) and the skin palette both
//!   compose with the slot through the accessors instead of clobbering it (the pre-0355 layout
//!   put the slot in the alpha bits: a feathering indoor character lost its probe AND read shade
//!   byte 0 = the lit exterior intensity — the director's "light jumps outdoor when I zoom in").
//!   Slot 0 is a valid payload: [`probe_bits`] always carries a non-zero alpha field, so the
//!   shader's untagged-⇒-opaque `0` sentinel never fires for these.
//!
//! **Who writes it** — five systems share the channel, deconflicted *by design*, not by luck:
//!
//! 1. `model_fade::apply_render_fade` (appear/despawn ramps) owns an entity's **alpha field**, and
//!    its **material**, while a `RenderFade` lives on it; the other *alpha* writers filter those
//!    entities out (`Without<RenderFade>`, `Without<PendingAppearFade>`). It writes through
//!    [`with_alpha`], so the shade, probe-slot and rig fields survive a fade.
//! 2. `interior::classify_entity_interior` is the owner of the **light law** for interior-capable
//!    parts (`InteriorLit` holders) — the payload's non-alpha fields (probe slot on the Bake law,
//!    plain payload otherwise, dropping the shade byte, which the shade writer below re-asserts
//!    the same frame, ordered after) **and** [`INTERIOR_FOG_BIT`] on that same population. Its
//!    whole-payload writes go through [`with_interior_probe`] / [`with_exterior_reset`], which
//!    carry the rig **and alpha** fields, and it then sets the flag through [`with_interior_fog`].
//!
//!    The law and the flag are **two questions with two answers**: the law is where the part
//!    stands (its own down-ray, re-asked only when it moves), the flag is whether that room is on
//!    the camera's chain (re-read every frame, because the camera moves when the part does not).
//!    An exterior-law part is never fogged; an indoor-law one is fogged only while its room's gate
//!    is on.
//!
//!    It is **not** filtered by fade state (decision 0755): the light law and the fade alpha are
//!    orthogonal, so 1 and 2 are deconflicted by *field*, not by lockout — the law follows a part
//!    through its appear/despawn ramp, and only the *material* defers to 1 while a fade is live
//!    (the fade picks the blend twin **of the law's family**, `FadeMaterials::material_for`). The
//!    old lockout is what made a streamed indoor unit ramp in under exterior light and then swap
//!    laws in a single frame the instant the ramp latched.
//! 3. `debug_panel::apply_model_visibility` drives the small-prop distance fade (`DoodadFade`
//!    holders) + glow-card dimming; `DoodadFade` is **never attached** to a lit interior prop
//!    (spawn-time exclusion in `terrain_stream`), so 2 and 3 are disjoint. The same system also
//!    owns [`INTERIOR_FOG_BIT`] on **room-bound WMO content** — anything carrying a
//!    `WmoGroupVis`: a building's group geometry, its doodad props, and the merged blobs of
//!    either. That is the client's per-group `[0xca7f00]` gate, whose population is disjoint from
//!    2's by construction (a WMO part is never classified — it holds no `InteriorLit`) and which
//!    writes through [`with_interior_fog`], so the probe slot a prop was spawned with survives
//!    the room turning its fog on and off.
//! 4. `player::apply_self_model_fade` (the zoom-to-first-person feather) runs **after** 1–3 and wins
//!    on the self body submeshes' alpha while feathering; on the frame it ends it restores the
//!    alpha field itself and hands the material back to the part's law (it cannot lean on 2 to
//!    re-opaque it — since 0755 that writer carries alpha through rather than forcing it).
//! 5. `entity_shade::update_ground_shade` owns the **shade field** on entity M2 parts (decision
//!    0173): read-modify-write via [`with_shade`], never touching alpha — so it composes with 1–4
//!    instead of racing them. It skips interior-classified parts (their payload is a colour) and
//!    runs after 2 to re-assert the byte over 2's exterior reclaim.
//!
//! A further *payload* writer (stealth, ghost form, …) should claim reserved bits through a typed
//! accessor here — never a new ad-hoc whole-payload convention (decision 0066's rule, upheld by
//! 0173's layout).
//!
//! **Bit 31 has its own single writer**, deconflicted by *schedule*, not by slot:
//! `target::highlight::apply_highlight` (PostUpdate) ORs/clears it on the hovered/targeted roots'
//! parts every frame. The payload writers above all run in Update and re-derive the payload bits
//! (dropping the flag); running after them re-asserts it the same frame, so they never need to know
//! it exists.
