//! The world-map projection laws (decision 0203 phase 2) — world position ↔ normalized map UV,
//! transcribed from the byte-verified primitives in wow-re's `ui` node (`scratch/geometry.md` +
//! `geo-decomp.c`; provenance there: two §5 pairs, op-order diffed bit-exact, for
//! `0x4a7100` / `0x4a72b0` / `0x4a7360` / `0x4a6ec0`).
//!
//! Frames: **world** is wow coords (wx +north, wy +west, yards); **UV** is [0,1]² over the map
//! art, u rightward (east), v downward (south) — exactly what `GetPlayerMapPosition` returns and
//! what the reference FrameXML multiplies by the detail-frame size (`x·w`, `−y·h` from TOPLEFT).
//!
//! The world map has three levels but only two laws:
//! - **World level** (both continents on one 62.625×41.75-tile sheet): the WorldMapContinent.dbc
//!   constants ([`WorldProj`]) drive `0x4a7360`'s world-mode branch ([`world_uv`]).
//! - **Continent and zone levels**: a guarded lerp over the WorldMapArea.dbc world rect
//!   ([`zone_uv`]) — a continent is just a big zone (its areaId=0 row carries a whole-continent
//!   rect, aspect 1.5 like every other row in the 5875 data).
//!
//! `0x4a72b0` (the arrow-frame variant) is the same world-mode math with a final `1 − v` flip —
//! it feeds the y-up arrow-frame anchor path (`0x4a8d20`), not the Lua position API, so it is not
//! transcribed here; our player blip goes through [`world_uv`]/[`zone_uv`] + FrameXML `SetPoint`
//! exactly like the reference's `GetPlayerMapPosition` consumers.
//!
//! NOT here: the 128×128 area-bitmap cell law (`0x4a6ec0`) — its consumers (`ProcessMapClick`/
//! `UpdateMapHighlight`) execute inside the engine's Lua bindings, so the transcription lives
//! with them in benilla-ui's `script/worldmap.rs` (the grid data is pushed in the catalog; the
//! source file is `Interface\WorldMap\<Continent>.zmp` — wow-re Q1 verdict, 2026-07-07).
