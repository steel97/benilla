//! `benilla-worldview` — **the engine with no game attached**, and the wall that keeps it that way.
//!
//! Decision 1160. `benilla-app` is being split: the world renderer becomes `benilla-world`, and the
//! game stands on it. A crate boundary alone cannot hold that line — in Bevy two systems couple
//! with no symbol crossing between them (a `Res<player::Player>` read needs that resource to exist
//! at *runtime*; move the type somewhere neutral and the crate graph is satisfied while the
//! coupling is fully intact). So the enforcer is a **second binary**: this one. It boots the engine
//! plugin set, spawns a free-fly camera, and flies over Elwynn — with no server, no login, no UI,
//! no player. Wire a game concept back into the engine and this stops working *that day, loudly*.
//!
//! It is also the world editor's first milestone: a window that loads a map and lets you fly
//! around is where `benilla-editor` starts.
//!
//! ## Reading this file
//!
//! The plugin list below is **the proposed cut line**, written down. Everything registered here is
//! claimed for `benilla-world`; everything in [`crate::run`] and not here is claimed for the game.
//! The `STUB` block is the spike's finding: the gameplay resources the engine reads *as data* and
//! which a stub therefore satisfies. Each stub is a line item on the work order — the engine should
//! end up not needing it (decision 1160, "the nine wires"), and until it doesn't, the stub says so
//! out loud rather than the coupling hiding inside a working game.
