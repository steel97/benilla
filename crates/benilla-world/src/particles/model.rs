//! **3-D MODEL particles** (wow-re `part-model-particles.md`, VERIFIED): an emitter whose
//! record names a geometry model renders each live particle as a tiny 3-D instance of that
//! model — quaternion-oriented, tumbling, over-life scaled and tinted — instead of a billboard
//! quad (Whirlwind's blades, Cone of Cold's shards, the cyclones, Death Wish). The sim
//! integrates position + spin ([`super::sim`]); this module owns the DRAW side: a per-emitter
//! pool of instance entities grown on demand, positioned after the sim each frame.
//!
//! Draw law (`0x7b4840` → `0x7b4510`): per particle, the instance transform is the particle
//! quaternion (× the emitter frame) at the particle position, scaled by the over-life SIZE
//! ramp; over-life COLOR rides a per-instance tint clone (`WowModelExt::tint`, the fx-tint
//! mechanism) and over-life ALPHA rides the per-instance `MeshTag` alpha field. The
//! reference's optional per-emitter depth sort (rt+0x1ac & 0x10) is folded into the pool-order
//! simplification named in decision 0148. The reference draws each instance through its
//! generic model-render pass; our instances are the geometry model's submeshes with their own
//! materials — mini-model *animation* (a rigged geometry model) is not run: every spell-corpus
//! geometry target probed is a static mesh, and a rigged one would surface as a visibly stiff
//! instance, the recorded trigger to extend this.
