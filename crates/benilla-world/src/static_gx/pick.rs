//! The retained pass answers the ray — **the lane names what it drew** (decision 1534).
//!
//! Slices 1–2 and B4 moved the static world's geometry off per-placement entities into retained
//! cell/region bakes. The pick declaration ([`crate::interact::PickMesh`] + `WorldObject`) rode
//! those entities, so the divert took it with them: over an absorbed doodad, building or prop the
//! inspector, the GO hover and `WOW_PICK` all answered *nothing*, and 0929's "pick geometry is
//! declared, never inferred" rule made that silence indistinguishable from a correctly transparent
//! surface. `mod.rs`'s B1 note called it out as a known gap and predicted "one side table if
//! missed"; this is that table, held where the geometry already is.
//!
//! The lane implements [`PickSource`] rather than publishing records to a shared index for one
//! reason: **only the lane knows what it actually drew this frame.** Its visibility is a CPU scene
//! walk — frustum + farclip + the exterior window gate at CELL grain, the portal PVS bit per GROUP,
//! the referrer-set OR per prop SET, and the exile kill bit per fader PLACEMENT — none of which is
//! a `ViewVisibility` an outside walker could read. So the admission below is the *published
//! verdict itself* ([`super::render::GxWorld::visible`] / `visible_wmos`, the very lists the render
//! node draws from), not a re-derivation that could disagree with the pixels.
//!
//! Cost is paid only when someone casts: no per-frame bookkeeping exists for this, and the
//! instruments that cast (the armed inspector, `WOW_PICK`) run at most once a frame.
