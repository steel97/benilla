//! **The retained static-world pass — ON by default** (decisions 1429–1434;
//! `WOW_STATIC_GX=0` opts out): the static world leaves bevy_pbr entirely and draws from
//! retained buffers in one custom render node, cross-material — per-vertex texture-array
//! layers + flag bits where the entity path had one material handle per batch. Grown in
//! four slices: B1 never-fade doodads + WMO group geometry, B2 faders via the exile
//! protocol, B3 the churn payments (shared pool, re-bake cadence, draw order, kill-aware
//! runs), B4 the WMO-prop absorption; flipped default-on at 1434 after the director's eye
//! passed at the pins.
//!
//! The correctness bar is pixel-identity against the entity path
//! (`WOW_STATIC_MERGE=0 WOW_STATIC_GX=0` vs the armed default) at the capture fixtures —
//! the on-demand A/B harness, not the director's eye (§7: captures are a regression tool).
//!
//! What it deliberately does NOT build (1429 stages them): horizon occlusion, class-aware
//! index baking (items are sorted by `(bucket, texture)` main-world and coalesced into runs
//! render-side; dims and format are only knowable there — BLP images are
//! `RENDER_WORLD`-only), and any default flip.
//!
//! The visibility terms at this lane's granularity (1429's table): frustum + farclip + the
//! exterior window gate are CPU per-CELL ([`cull_cells`] — the real client's own shape, a CPU
//! scene walk feeding retained draws); fade is the EXILE PROTOCOL (B2, decision 1431 — see
//! below); portal PVS and the billboard-owner term never apply to ADT doodads; the dev
//! kind/blend toggles are honoured cell-wholesale via [`crate::dev_state::DebugState`]'s
//! doodad toggle (a prototype coarsening — the entity path toggles per blend class).
//!
//! **B2 (decision 1431): faders ride the retained pass via the exile protocol.** The pass
//! draws only fade = 1 content: a fader placement diverts with an exile SEED (uid + handle
//! clones of the production bundle), and [`cull::cull_cells`]'s per-frame scan classifies it
//! on `doodad_fade_alpha` — the same function the entity authority evaluates. Steady = drawn
//! retained, no entity rows; Exiled (0 < α < 1) = every item takes the record-table KILL BIT
//! (the vertex stage collapses it to a zero-area point) and the placement respawns as
//! ordinary entities, so the feather is the entity path's own look by construction; Gone
//! (α = 0) = killed, nothing spawned anywhere. Exits carry 1 yd hysteresis; entry none.
//! The frame discipline is the OVERLAP PROTOCOL (1421's pop class, prevented structurally):
//! an exile's entities flush at `PostUpdate`'s end and first draw NEXT frame, and the kill
//! bit waits for them (`FaderState::Exiled::armed`) — the retained item dies in the same
//! rendered frame the entity appears; a re-admit clears the bit and despawns in one frame
//! (the despawn lands before extract, the cleared bit rides the same publish). Never order
//! this chain's commands to flush mid-`PostUpdate` — the plugin's `chain_ignore_deferred`
//! note records the bevy_pbr panic that forbids it. `WOW_STATIC_GX_FADE=0` is the fader
//! lane-isolation lever; `WOW_GX_FADE_TRACE=1` logs transitions; the census carries
//! `faders=`/`fade_events=`.
//!
//! Exclusions the collector refuses (each falls through to the ordinary merge/entity path, and
//! the flush logs a one-line census so a declined population is never silent): env-mapped
//! batches (`texture_unit_lookup > 2` — view-generated UVs), the depth-flag oddities
//! (`no_depth_write`/`no_depth_test` — pipeline-state per batch), and the `ShadeSel::Matte`/
//! `Rig` families (exterior WMO MODD props ride the prop site, not this lane).
//!
//! **Slice-1 verdict (the first capture A/B, 2026-08-18):** against a selfcheck floor of
//! exactly 0, the armed sweep reads MAE 0.000 on all four scenarios with 13–65 pixels per
//! 5.8-Mpx frame differing by exactly 1/255 (float-order residue of the baked-transform
//! arithmetic; zero pixels beyond 8) — pixel-identical to the quantization limit, ~1,500
//! retained cell bakes participating. Two desk-found parity terms live in render.rs/the WGSL:
//! the aniso-8 samplers, and the two-sided normal law (the entity shader's `select` UNDOES a
//! bevy negation this pipeline never had — copying it flipped every back-facing canopy card).
//!
//! **Known B1 gaps** (B2+ owns them): dev-instrument identity (inspector/WOW_PICK name nothing
//! — the weld/merge trade, one side table if missed) is **CLOSED by 1534**: the side table is the
//! items' own [`GxItem::object`]/[`GxItem::local_aabb`], and [`pick`] is the lane answering the ray
//! from this frame's published selection. The other one B1 left open — no
//! `presentable()` coupling, so an unbaked region shows a hole for a beat on a cold arrival
//! where the merge publishes `merge_pending` into the reveal cover (1419) — is **CLOSED by
//! 1498**: [`StaticGx::undrawn_regions`] is that coupling, and [`StaticGx::flush_now`] is why
//! it costs the load no extra frames. It was not a beat: it was the director's report of
//! teleporting into a Stormwind with no Stormwind in it.
//!
//! **B3 (decision 1432): the churn 1431 priced is paid.** Texture arrays are ONE SHARED POOL
//! across every cell and region (dedup by asset id; `pool.rs` owns the design note), layer
//! copies encode exactly once, re-bakes ride the long quiet window ([`REBAKE_FRAMES`] —
//! 1424's consolidate-on-quiet at bake grain), admitted cells and regions draw NEAR-FIRST
//! (the 1.12 band walk's effect at cell grain), and killed items are dropped from the draw
//! runs entirely rather than collapsed in the vertex stage (the WGSL collapse stays as belt).
//!
//! **Slice 2 (1429's second half): WMO group geometry.** An order-free WMO group batch diverts
//! into a region keyed by its placement's [`crate::wmo_portal::WmoPortalInstance`] ENTITY —
//! the PVS identity — with draws bucketed per (pipeline bucket × texture × GROUP), so the
//! portal flood's per-frame verdict becomes CPU range selection over retained buffers (the
//! design's load-bearing collapse: the client's own per-group draw records). Per-group
//! admission each frame = the PVS bit (fail-open, honouring the `portal_cull` A/B switch) ∧
//! frustum ∧ farclip ∧ the exterior window gate with the own-building exemption — the same
//! seven-term collapse as cells, at group granularity. Region lifecycle follows the INSTANCE
//! entity's death, never the owner tile: a straddler handoff keeps the placement (and its
//! instance) alive under a new owner, and tile-keyed release would have dropped the retained
//! geometry out from under it. The WMO lighting lanes (MOCV inside the clamp, INT/TRANS batch
//! classes, SIDN night glow, WINDOW midpoint light, the interior fog triple, ZERO point
//! lights, the authored batch-order clip-z nudge) mirror `wow_model.wgsl` in `static_gx.wgsl`.
//!
//! **B4 (decision 1433): the prop site joins the pass — A's blobs absorbed.** WMO doodad
//! props (1418's lane 3, the population A merged) divert into PROP REGIONS keyed by the same
//! instance entity as the WMO regions but held apart (props trickle in as their M2s load;
//! a shared region would re-bake the building's geometry per arrival — B3's churn class).
//! Admission is per REFERRER SET (the distinct room-sets naming this region's props): the
//! PVS bit ORs over the set exactly like `WmoGroupVis::drawn_by`, ∧ frustum ∧ farclip ∧ the
//! exterior gate with the own-building exemption — an empty set (an unnamed prop) admits
//! bare and is never exterior-gated (0784's untagged rule). Interior props light from their
//! folded SH probe: the slot rides the record table (w bits 1..14) and the shader reads the
//! probe region of the SAME shared light buffer every material binds; live point lights are
//! zero (folded at spawn), fog is the interior triple. Exterior props take the Matte
//! fixed-1.0 sun family ([`WORD_MATTE`]). Declined and censused, not absorbed: exterior
//! FADER props (the exile protocol has no prop shape — they keep the default path's own
//! per-entity fade) and props of instance-less placements (no PVS identity). With B4, the
//! armed lane leaves A's merge only the divert's declined families; the default flip is a
//! later record's question. `WOW_STATIC_GX_PROP=0` is the lane-isolation lever.
//!
//! **Slice-2 verdict (2026-08-18):** floors exactly 0 on all 11 scenarios; the armed A/B
//! reads MAE ≤ 0.003 with 99.9 % of differing pixels at exactly 1/255 and 2–35 px/frame
//! beyond 8 (isolated silhouette-edge pixels) — the arithmetic floor of a baked
//! re-expression, not a lane error; the tram (near-origin placements) matches at exactly 0.
//! LBRS agreement: entity-lane WMO drops 33 → 0 drawn while the retained pass selects 2
//! groups / 52 items, stable over the 300-frame window — the flood as range selection, no
//! leak. Three desk-found laws this slice: texture-array layers DEDUPE by texture (per-item
//! layers blew the 2,048 D2-array limit the moment Stormwind baked); the bake's position leg
//! runs in f64 (`bake.rs` owns the note — the f32 world intermediate was 0974's defect
//! reintroduced, half a pixel indoors); and a colour-less batch multiplies by CONSTANT 1.0,
//! never the interpolated white (GPU interpolation of a constant is 1.0±ε and re-rounded
//! ~half of all textured pixels one byte down). `WOW_STATIC_GX_WMO=0` is the lane-isolation
//! lever that attributed the residue; `WOW_GX_CENSUS=1` is the agreement instrument; the
//! `house-north-midnight` fixture is the one capture where SIDN is live pixels.
