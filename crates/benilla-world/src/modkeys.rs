//! **The modifier keys** — the dev-overlay chord every instrument is bound on, and the
//! stuck-modifier reconciliation that keeps the keyboard honest underneath it.
//!
//! The chord ([`dev_chord`]) lived in `debug_panel` because the panel was its first user; six
//! modules then reached into a *debug overlay* to ask whether Ctrl+Shift was down — the player
//! controller's free-fly toggle and land-here, the perf HUD, the sound mute, the inspector.
//! Decision 1160 moves it here, where the leaf module that already owns modifier state is
//! (92 lines, no dependants of its own). Nothing about "which two modifiers are the dev plane" is
//! a debug-panel opinion.
//!
//! ## Stuck-modifier reconciliation against the OS's live flag state (decision 0606)
//!
//! macOS system shortcuts that grab the keyboard *without* de-focusing the window — the ⇧⌘5
//! screenshot overlay is the canonical one — swallow the modifiers' release events: the overlay is
//! a non-activating panel, so the app never receives `Focused(false)` (Bevy's stuck-key reset,
//! `KeyboardFocusLost` → `release_all`, never fires), and winit only synthesizes modifier key
//! events from `flagsChanged`, which the grabbed keyboard never delivers (verified in
//! winit 0.30.13 `platform_impl/macos/view.rs::update_modifiers`). `ButtonInput<KeyCode>` then
//! reports Shift/Cmd held indefinitely, and every bare-key binding — the action bar's number row
//! behind `ui_script::input`'s bare-binding gate — goes dead until the user happens to tap the
//! stuck modifier again.
//!
//! The fix: poll the OS's live modifier state (`+[NSEvent modifierFlags]` — hardware-derived and
//! documented as independent of the event stream) once per frame, right after Bevy's own input
//! collection, and **release** any modifier Bevy believes is down but the OS says is up.
//! Release-only by design: the hardware state leads the event stream, so a legitimately
//! just-pressed modifier is never wrongly released — whereas synthesizing *presses* from the poll
//! could race in-flight release events and manufacture the same bug in reverse. The poll can't
//! tell left from right within a family, so an up family releases both variants (only ever a
//! correction — a genuinely held key keeps its family bit set and is never touched).

/// 1043 — which moved the last two dev keys onto it, so the whole fleet is here now.)
///
/// The dev instruments used to sit on bare letters, which is a namespace we don't own: every letter is
/// a *game* binding in the reference client, so `P` both opened the spellbook and toggled the perf HUD
/// (0585). They moved to `Ctrl`+`Cmd`, and then off it: on Windows that is `Ctrl`+`Win`, a plane the
/// shell owns and keeps extending — `Win+Ctrl+M` is Magnifier settings, which had our mute (0867).
///
/// **`Ctrl`+`Shift`, one plane on every OS** (0870, director's call). The alternative was keeping
/// `Ctrl`+`Cmd` on macOS for its one real advantage — Cmd is outside the reference's binding namespace
/// (1.12 builds binding names from `ALT-`/`CTRL-`/`SHIFT-` only), so nothing in game could *ever* claim
/// it. That buys protection against a binding no default declares and no player has yet written, and
/// it costs a per-OS split in the docs, the hints and the reader's head. One plane wins. It also drops
/// our dependence on winit's `sendEvent:` swizzle, without which AppKit's swallowed `keyUp` under Cmd
/// would latch a chord after one use (0585's macOS risk, now simply not run).
///
/// `Ctrl`+`Shift` is the emptiest plane the reference *can* name: of its 152 defaults, exactly two
/// carry two modifiers — `CTRL-SHIFT-TAB` and `CTRL-SHIFT-PAGEDOWN` — and no letter at all.
/// `Ctrl`+`Alt` was never available: that is AltGr, which European layouts type real characters with
/// (decision 0702).
///
/// **Exactly those two modifiers and no others**, both sides of each. The block is what makes this
/// plane safe to leave ungated below: AltGr+Shift+*key* is `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Shift`+*key*, and a German
/// layout typing one of those into chat must not fire an overlay.
///
/// **"No letter at all" was half the story, and the missing half cost us a plane's worth of safety**
/// (decision 1142). The reference does not match bindings by equality alone: an exact miss re-probes
/// **once** with the leftmost modifier dropped, so `CTRL-SHIFT-`*key* falls through to
/// `SHIFT-`*key* — never to the bare letter, which is why this plane survived the correction at all,
/// but far enough that `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` would open the pet paper doll (`SHIFT-P`,
/// `TOGGLECHARACTER3`) under the perf HUD. So the other half of the rule now lives where the law
/// itself does, in `bindings::BindingDispatch::resolve`: this plane spends the keyboard's
/// **fallback probe**, and only that — an exact `CTRL-SHIFT-` binding, the reference's two included,
/// still dispatches normally.
///
/// Deliberately **not** gated on [`crate::ui_script::UiKeyboardCapture`] the way the bare-key toggles
/// were: a chord can't be mistaken for typed text, so the dev overlays stay reachable with the chat bar
