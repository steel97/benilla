//! **Frame pacing** — the clock we animate on follows the *presentation* cadence, not the CPU loop.
//!
//! Under `PresentMode::Fifo` (our default — `video::present_mode`) a frame is displayed only on a
//! refresh boundary, so the interval the eye receives is always an exact multiple of the monitor's
//! period. The interval we *measure* is not: Bevy stamps `Time<Real>` once per main-schedule pass,
//! and with pipelined rendering the main thread's wait for the render thread is where vsync
//! back-pressure lands. That wait moves around, so two frames shown 16.67 ms apart can be measured
//! as 26.4 ms and 8.0 ms. Their sum is right; the split is not.
//!
//! Advancing an animation by that split samples the pose at instants the display never shows: the
//! model lurches ahead by the long delta, then barely moves on the short one. It is a rigid,
//! whole-skeleton motion — every bone at once — which is exactly how it was reported ("a lot of
//! jitter on the whole model", standing still, hands off the mouse), and why it is invisible until
//! you are zoomed close enough for a fraction of a millimetre to be a pixel.
//!
//! **Measured at the Elwynn guard pin** (`.go xyz -9481.53 76.10 56.57 0`, 3200×1800, camera
//! parked, no input), 1805 frames of steady state:
//!
//! - 77 frames (4.3%) had a delta more than 3 ms off the 16.663 ms median.
//! - **27 of them were long/short PAIRS summing to an exact multiple of the refresh** — (26.4, 8.0),
//!   (25.3, 8.0), (20.2, 13.2), (25.9, 7.1) — i.e. both frames were presented on cadence and only
//!   the timestamps were split wrong. Just 3 were genuine dropped frames.
//! - 91% of 10-frame windows summed to within 2 ms of 166.7 ms: presentation stayed locked.
//! - The median bone's Δ tracked `dt` proportionally (`Δ/dt` constant to three digits), so the pose
//!   is *correct for the time it is handed*. The time is what is wrong.
//! - Whole-skeleton events (up to 91 of 117 bones past a quarter-pixel in one frame) landed on
//!   those frames **95%** of the time: `P(twitch | bad delta) = 0.26` against `0.0006` otherwise.
//!
//! **What this does.** When the recent deltas look like a vsync cadence, the raw delta is snapped to
//! the nearest whole multiple of the estimated refresh period and the remainder is carried into the
//! next frame, so the long-run elapsed time still matches the wall clock exactly — no time is
//! invented and none is lost. When the cadence does not look like vsync (uncapped, a genuine hitch,
//! a load spike) the raw delta passes through untouched: pacing must never paper over a real stall,
//! only correct a mis-split one.
//!
//! **Why `Time<Virtual>` and not `Time<Real>`.** `Real` is the wall clock, and the probe harness is
//! required to read it (`capture::probes::ProbeClock`, decision 0789) precisely so a hitching run
//! cannot silently under-run a knob. Pacing it would hide the defect from the instrument that found
//! it. `Virtual` is Bevy's own *adjustable* game clock and is what `advance_animations`, the
//! particle/ribbon sims and `Time<Fixed>` all derive from — one correction there reaches every
//! animating consumer, which is the point: this is not a rig defect, it is a clock defect.
//!
//! `WOW_NO_FRAME_PACE=1` turns it off — the A/B lever, same shape as `WOW_NO_RIG_REBASE`. A
//! hand-driven clock (`TimeUpdateStrategy::Manual*` — the capture harness, the deterministic
//! tests) is never paced: those runs exist to reproduce frame-for-frame.
