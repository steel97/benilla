//! **A body standing in the world** — what the engine needs to know about a unit, and nothing
//! about where it came from.
//!
//! Five engine lanes filtered on `net::NetEntity` and `net::SelfPlayer` to mean "a streamed unit"
//! and "the viewer's own", and one of them also read the wire record's scale and the game's
//! collision-height component. None of that is wire knowledge: the fade resolver wants to know
//! which root is the avatar so first person can feather it, the shade sampler wants the same, the
//! room tracker wants every body that can be inside a building, the palette census wants to label
//! its lanes, and the foam emitter wants a cylinder with a radius. A world renderer cannot depend
//! on a protocol crate's entity record to answer any of them.
//!
//! So the game states it. [`WorldUnit`] on every unit entity, [`ViewerUnit`] on the one the eye
//! belongs to — both written by whatever spawns bodies, both meaningless to a program that spawns
//! none, which is exactly the property `benilla-worldview` needs.
//!
//! **State it at the spawn when the body must be live the same frame.** `entities::
//! publish_world_units` reconciles every `NetEntity` into a `WorldUnit`, but it runs between the
//! wire drain and the rest of the frame — which is right for bodies that arrive on the wire, and
//! one frame late for anything spawned after that slot. The water-foam fixture spawns in
//! `WorldStage::Present` and lost its first frame of ripple to exactly this, shifting every
//! ripple's age for the whole aged capture. Treat `WorldUnit` like `Transform`: part of what it
//! means to spawn a body, with the reconciler as the wire path's safety net rather than the only
//! writer.
//!
//! **This is a restatement, not a second source of truth**, and the difference matters: the fields
//! are copies of facts the game already owns (`NetEntity::scale`, `CollisionHeight`), refreshed by
//! one system on change. A stale copy is a wrong foam radius, not a wrong world — and the
//! alternative, handing the engine the wire record, is the dependency this whole stage exists to
//! delete.
