//! The current-group **down-ray** — which room is the camera in, and which flood roots follow.
//!
//! The faithful port of the client's per-frame probe (`FUN_006821f0` → `FUN_006be250` → `0x6a3f80`;
//! `wow-5875-re` `system/models/scratch/wmo-current-group.md` + `wmo-portal-audit.md` Q2/Q3/Q4/Q5):
//! a vertical ray from the eye down `1760` yd races two legs, nearest crossing wins —
//!
//! - **Leg A — walking-collision faces** (the client's collision BSP, MOPY mask `0x84`): every
//!   non-DETAIL face, **no orientation filter** — stair treads, risers, ledges, sloped trim all count.
//!   A render-face `|n.z|` floor heuristic here is exactly what mis-seeded doorways (the straddle) and
//!   slab edges: the real face set tracks the room boundary to sub-yard, the proxy lagged it (Q4/Q5).
//! - **Leg B — portal crossings** (`0x6a3f80`): where the ray crosses a portal polygon, the group is
//!   picked by the eye's **side of the portal plane** (`group_a iff (signed_dist ≥ 0) == (side > 0)`,
//!   else the neighbour) — the vertically-stacked tie-break (a stairwell's floor-hole portal flips the
//!   room the instant the eye crosses the plane). A near-parallel portal (a vertical doorway vs the
//!   vertical ray, `|denom| < 1e-4`) counts as crossed only while the eye is within the `0.1`-yd snap
//!   window of its plane (`0x7c22b0`'s parallel branch). A crossing within `~1e-4` of the nearest face
//!   hit still wins (`0x80c4f4`) — a floor-hole portal coincident with the slab's faces flips the room.
//!
//! The verdict is a **set**, not a single group: the in-group plus (for a portal win) the across-group,
//! both appended to the client's visible-group set `0xc7cd88` and each flooded as an independent root
//! (Q2). An exterior winner or no crossing within the ray ⇒ outside (empty set, the outside leg).
//!
//! - **The terrain race** (`terrain_z`): the same down-segment is cast against the **terrain** — the
//!   client runs both probes and drops the WMO hit when the ground is *strictly* nearer
//!   (`FUN_006821f0` `0x6822a2 fld t_terrain; fcomp t_wmo; test ah,5; jp` — falls through to clear the
//!   WMO flag only on `t_terrain < t_wmo`; `GetAreaID 0x670250` arbitrates identically at `0x670345`).
//!   Equal keeps the WMO. Without this leg a camera standing on open ground **above a buried interior**
//!   — a mine dug into a hillside — reads "inside a tunnel" and the flood culls the building out from
//!   under it (decision 0258; it is what 0233 deferred). Terrain *above* the eye is not on the
//!   down-segment at all, which is exactly what keeps a real tunnel reading INSIDE, and a column in an
//!   MCNK hole has no terrain surface to hit, which is how a mine entrance stays walkable.
//!
//! - **Leg C — the camera-void fallback** (decision 0692; **ours**, not the client's): only when Legs
//!   A and B both miss AND no terrain surface sits at or below the eye's column, the same race runs
//!   once more over the **camera-only** faces (DETAIL set, NOCAMCOLLIDE clear — the faces that stop
//!   the camera but never carried the walking BSP). The client returns "outside" here and blanks the
//!   building — reproducible in 5875 at the Deadmines entrance, whose behind-the-portal pocket is
//!   floored entirely with DETAIL faces: the camera is sealed in by its own collision yet the flood
//!   loses it. An eye that camera-collision itself proves is between interior surfaces, under ground
//!   level, names the room that owns the surface below it instead. The gates keep the divergence out
//!   of every place the client's verdict is *right*: any terrain at/below the eye (doorsteps, streets,
//!   open country) or any Leg A/B result leaves the faithful answer untouched.
