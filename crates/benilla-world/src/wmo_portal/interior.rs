//! - [`CurrentWmoInterior`] — the RENDER/AUDIO seed's claim (faces + portal crossings,
//!   [`super::seed::down_ray_seeds`]): what room the flood seeds from; consumed by the

//! - [`CurrentAreaInterior`] — the ZONE-TEXT/AREA claim (faces only, [`super::seed::area_down_ray`];
//!   wow-re `zonetext-indoor-bit.md`, the CGLight node's `+0x90` bit 0): drives the leaf-area
