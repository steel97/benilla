//! **Is a claimed WMO room visible this frame?** — the one answer two elections share.
//!
//! The reference elects an object standing in a WMO group with its building (`0x6834e0`, inside
//! the WMO-group render path): if the group isn't rendered this frame, the object is pass 2 —
//! neither drawn nor ticked. Two of our systems ask exactly that question of a body's
//! [`UnitWmoRoom`] claim: the anim-LOD gate (`creature_anim::lod`, decision 0739 — parks the
//! pose) and the body draw election (`crate::exterior_cull`, decision 1475 — hides the root).
//! One function answers both, so the two can never drift apart (the drift is how 0448's park and
//! 0648's draw ended up disagreeing for a month — decision 1473).
