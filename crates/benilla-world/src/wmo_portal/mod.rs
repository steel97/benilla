//! WMO portal-based visibility culling — the per-frame pass that decides which of a building's groups
//! are reachable through portals from the camera's current group, so an interior the camera can't see
//! through any doorway (the Stormwind cathedral above the Trade District) is not drawn.
//!
//! This is the **faithful** mechanism, re-derived from `WoW.exe` 5875 (`wow-5875-re`
//! `system/models/models.md` → "WMO portal-based visibility culling", VERIFIED). The client carries a
//! 2-D screen rectangle as its working frustum and floods the portal graph from the camera's group:
//! for each portal it (1) tests the camera is on the portal's front side, (2) projects the portal
//! polygon to a screen rect, (3) intersects that with the incoming rect, and (4) recurses into the
//! neighbour with the narrowed rect — terminating a branch the moment the rect collapses to zero area.
//! That collapse is exactly why the cathedral culls from the Trade District but draws from the gates.
//!
//! Exterior shells: a building's outer-shell group (an inn's walls/roof) often carries **no portals**, so
//! the interior flood can't reach it. The client draws exterior groups from inside via a separate
//! *deferred-window* pass, **gated** on the flood having reached a doorway onto the outdoors. We
//! reproduce that gate (`wow-5875-re` `wmo-insideleg-phase3.md`): reach a portal onto an exterior group ⇒
//! draw the exterior shell (frustum-culled); reach none ⇒ leave it culled (you can't see out).
//!
//! Seam: this module only **computes** the per-group visible set ([`WmoPortalInstance::visible`]). The
//! single `Visibility` authority ([`crate::debug_panel`]'s `apply_model_visibility`, decision 0025)
//! reads it and ANDs it with the dev toggles + the far-clip cull — we never write `Visibility` here.
//!
//! Current-group seed: the **downward raycast** in [`seed`] — the byte-audited client mechanism
//! (`wow-5875-re` `wmo-current-group.md` + `wmo-portal-audit.md`): walking-collision faces race portal
//! crossings under the eye, and the verdict is a **seed set** (in-group + across-group), each flooded
//! as an independent root. The epsilons here (side test exactly `0.0`, rect collapse `0.001`, the
//! `w`-clamp pair, the `0.1` near-parallel snap) are the client's own constants, read from the binary
//! — do not "fix" them to tolerances without re-deriving there first.
