//! WMO portal-based visibility culling — the per-frame pass that decides which of a building's groups
//! are reachable through portals from the camera's current group, so an interior the camera can't see
//! through any doorway (the Stormwind cathedral above the Trade District) is not drawn.
//!
//! This is the **faithful** mechanism, re-derived from `WoW.exe` 5875 (`wow-5875-re`
//! `system/models/models.md` → "WMO portal-based visibility culling", VERIFIED). The client carries a
//! 2-D screen rectangle as its working frustum and floods the portal graph from the camera's group:
//! for each portal it (1) tests the camera is on the portal's front side, (2) projects the portal
//! polygon to a screen rect, (3) intersects that with the incoming rect, and (4) recurses into the
//! neighbour with the narrowed rect — terminating a branch the moment the rect collapses to zero area.
//! That collapse is exactly why the cathedral culls from the Trade District but draws from the gates.
//!
//! Exterior shells: a building's outer-shell group (an inn's walls/roof) often carries **no portals**, so
//! the interior flood can't reach it. The client draws exterior groups from inside via a separate
//! *deferred-window* pass, **gated** on the flood having reached a doorway onto the outdoors
//! (`wow-5875-re` `wmo-insideleg-phase3.md`): reach none and the whole pass is skipped — you can't
//! see out. Reach one and, **per window**, every `0x8` group visible in a frustum clipped to that
//! doorway becomes a **flood root of its own** (`0x6b3d39 call 0x6b41c0` — the same recursion, not a
//! draw), carrying that window's rect onward through the graph. So a doorway shows you the courtyard
//! beyond it *and* what the courtyard's own portals show, narrowing all the way (decision 1853).
//!
//! Seam: this module only **computes** the per-group visible set ([`WmoPortalInstance::visible`]). The
//! single `Visibility` authority ([`crate::debug_panel`]'s `apply_model_visibility`, decision 0025)
//! reads it and ANDs it with the dev toggles + the far-clip cull — we never write `Visibility` here.
//!
//! Current-group seed: the **downward raycast** in [`seed`] — the byte-audited client mechanism
//! (`wow-5875-re` `wmo-current-group.md` + `wmo-portal-audit.md`): walking-collision faces race portal
//! crossings under the eye, and the verdict is a **seed set** (in-group + across-group), each flooded
//! as an independent root. The epsilons here (side test exactly `0.0`, rect collapse `0.001`, the
//! `w`-clamp pair, the `0.1` near-parallel snap) are the client's own constants, read from the binary
//! — do not "fix" them to tolerances without re-deriving there first.

    // both matter: it tests the group against the **full camera frustum** (no window narrowing —
    // there is no `0x682930` call on this path), and it is the `jbe` **fall-through**, so it runs
    // even when the worklist is empty. A `0x10000` group therefore draws from a SEALED interior
    // room, where nothing else of the building's outside does. Its draw is `0x6b4160` → `0x685d70`,
    // the same per-group draw callback the flood itself uses, minus the portal recursion.
    //
    // **Both legs, unlike the two passes above.** Those live in `0x6b3b20`, which runs only when the
    // camera has a containing map object; but the camera-OUTSIDE seed `0x6b3dd0` walks the same MOGI
    // array with the same fork — `flags & 0x10000 -> 0x6b4160`, `flags & 0x8` frustum-pass -> the
    // portal flood — so a callback group is drawn from outdoors by the identical callback. Gating
    // this on the inside leg would have left 20 of the 24 undrawable from anywhere, including
    // `stormwind.wmo#086`, a 322×236×258 yd piece of the city (wow-re ledger row `0x6b3dd0`).
    //
    // What this restores: the 24 groups no pass of ours reached from inside — 14 in `stormwind.wmo`
    // (the canals and the tall district shell), 6 across the two Dire Maul roots, and Razorfen
    // Downs'/Kraul's four 450–520 yd enclosing shells. Those last four also carry `0x8`, so before
    // this they were window-tested by Pass 2 and vanished whenever no doorway showed them; the
    // reference draws them regardless.
    // **All four dispatch arms across both legs frustum-test the MOGI AABB first** — inside Pass 3 at
    // `0x6b3d9d`, the outside `0x10000` arm at `0x6b3f2d`, and the two `0x8` arms — with byte-identical
    // setup (`lea ecx,[eax+4]` = the record's six AABB floats, `call 0x682f60`, `test eax,eax; jne`,
    // culled = nonzero), differing only in stack slots. `0x6b4160` itself is `__thiscall(root,
