//! Paced model render-form building — the model-lane twin of the tile furnisher (decision 0834,
//! closing 0832's named residual).
//!
//! The M2/WMO loaders ship **geometry, no meshes** (`ModelSubmesh::geometry`): a loader-built
//! labeled sub-asset lands the instant its decode completes, and the render world ingests the
//! whole model — a city root's thousands of group batches, a fresh row's hundreds of doodads —
//! in ONE frame. Measured at the Stormwind line (pre-0834): 2000–3200 mesh assets per crossing,
//! 44–119 ms wall on the worst frame, on every crossing including re-entries. No budget
//! downstream of a load can spread work the loader has already packaged, so the build lives
//! here: consumers `require()` the forms they need, and [`furnish_model_forms`] builds a bounded
//! amount per frame while live — nearest requester first — uncapped behind the loading cover.
//!
//! One [`Entry`] per loaded model asset holds the built handles; every instance of the model
//! shares them (the build runs once per asset, not per placement). The **static** form is
//! `RENDER_WORLD`-only with its `Aabb` computed at build time (the exterior cull fails open on a
//! missing bound — 0832's rule); the **skinned** twin keeps main-world data because the mouseover
//! picker CPU-skins its vertices (`target::hover`), and it is built only for lanes that rig —
//! which retires the loader's old always-built, mostly-unused twin (the 0019 deferral).
