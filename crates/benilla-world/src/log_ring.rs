//! **The last few hundred log lines, kept in memory** — so a crash report can carry what the
//! client was doing when it died (decision 2266 §B2).
//!
//! The only log sink is stderr, and a player's terminal (or a packaged Windows build with no
//! console at all) is gone with the process. Of bug B390's four reporters one attached anything,
//! and only because he had set `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` himself. A panic hook can write a file, but a
//! payload and a backtrace without the minute of log before them is a symptom without a story:
//! which zone, which opcode, which asset was loading. This ring is that story.
//!
//! Installed as [`bevy::log::LogPlugin::custom_layer`] by [`crate::boot::tuned_default_plugins`],
//! so it sits under the same `EnvFilter` as the stderr formatter — the ring holds exactly the lines
//! stderr showed, no more (a `wgpu=trace` firehose the filter drops never reaches it either).
//! Bounded at [`CAPACITY`] lines; the cost is one string clone per emitted line, on the thread that
//! logged it, behind a mutex that is never held across anything else.
//!
//! Read with [`recent`]. Nothing else in the engine reads it: it is an artefact feed, not a log.
