//! The shared **mat-anim table** (decision 1381) — the per-frame samples of every UV-scroll /
//! tint-animated batch material, delivered through the `wow_light` buffer instead of by mutating
//! the material asset.
//!
//! **Why.** `doodad_anim::tick_anim_materials` used to write each drawn animated material's
//! sampled offset into the asset every frame (`sun_scale.zw` / `tint`). Every such write is an
//! `AssetEvent::Modified`: a uniform re-upload plus, on the Metal non-bindless path, a bind-group
//! rebuild (~57 µs per material — B131's measurement), plus the whole-population `AssetChanged`
//! walks it arms (`mark_meshes_as_changed_if_their_materials_changed`, the per-material-type
//! specialization checks), plus the far-twin mirror's whole-material re-insert
//! (`model_render::classify_water_side`). 1375 bounded the *scan* and gated *unchanged* writes;
//! this module removes the mutation itself — the remaining half of 1370's finding.
//!
//! **The encoding: rows are DELTAS from the built seed, and zero is identity.** A registered
//! material keeps its build-time `sun_scale.zw = sample(0.0)` seed (and its `tint` first-key)
//! untouched for ever; the shader adds `matanim[slot]` on top, with **row 0 pinned to zero** so
//! `anim_slots = 0` — every static material — reads a no-op without a branch. Zero-as-identity is
//! [`crate::instance_tint`]'s own argument, and it buys the same three properties here: the
//! portrait booths' studio buffers (zeroed region ⇒ the seed pose, the static studio look),
//! deterministic captures (the tick is skipped ⇒ zero deltas ⇒ bit-identical to the old seed
//! frames), and slot exhaustion (no slot ⇒ frozen at seed, never garbage).
//!
//! Region layout: between the rig-origin table and the straddle clip table ([`crate::straddle`]);
//! the palette rows stay last (the palette array is runtime-sized) — `wow_model.wgsl`'s struct
//! mirrors this order.
