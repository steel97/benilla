//! Building an **off-world light blob** — the portrait booths' frozen studio light, the body
//! panes' reference light, the glue scene's authored-rig light.
//!
//! The shared world light is built by [`super::global_light`] on the frame path. These three are
//! not on that path: they are written once (or once per scene swap) into a buffer of their own,
//! and they all bind against the *same* std430 struct the model shaders declare. That struct's
//! layout is the thing they must not know.
//!
//! [`super::global_light::pack_model_core_rows`] already made half this argument and says so in
//! its own doc — *"a producer that copies the layout goes stale the day the layout moves — so
//! producers don't copy it, they call this"* — after the booth rendered black portraits the day
//! 0354 moved the lit lanes onto rows it never wrote. But it packs only the lit lanes. Every
//! producer still hand-wrote the spec row, the two fog rows, the intensity dial, the point-table
//! count, the point rows' interleave, and the byte offset of the probe region. Six pieces of the
//! same layout, copied three times, one 0354 away from the same failure. This is the rest of that
//! argument: the producers state values, and nothing outside this module states a row index.
