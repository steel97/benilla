//! The **tuned Bevy boot** — the `DefaultPlugins` set every benilla binary stands on.
//!
//! Extracted from `benilla_app::run` the moment there was a second binary to boot ([`crate::worldview`],
//! decision 1160): the window differs per binary, but the *engine* tuning — the asset root, the log
//! filter, the task-pool sizing and QoS, and the disabled audio plugin — must not. Each of those
//! four is load-bearing and each was learned the hard way; a second boot that quietly re-derived
//! them would be a second place for them to rot.
//!
//! The `Window` stays the caller's, because that is genuinely per-binary: the client's is shaped by
//! the capture harness and the background-run rules (decisions 0703/0709/1148), the world viewer's
//! is a plain window.

        // loads there. Bevy's default caps that pool at 4 threads, so a teleport into a dense area —
