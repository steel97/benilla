//! Water foam — the client's **`CWater0Ripple`** wade wake / standing ring / step-in splash,
//! rebuilt as the reference's actual **record model** (decision 0264; supersedes the ribbon of 0240
//! and the stamps of 0234).
//!
//! Ground truth, twice over: the byte-exact RE (wow-5875-re `system/terrain/scratch/`
//! `water-ripple-decal.md` + the `waterdecal-*.c` decomps, §5-verified) **and** two live GL traces
//! of the reference reconstructed frame-by-frame (Northshire wade 2026-07-08 + standing-ring
//! capture 2026-07-10; per-record texgen fits residual ≈ 0). The verified model:
//!
//! - **A decal is a pool record, not a mesh idiom.** Per wading unit the client emits records into
//!   a 128-slot pool (32 reserved for the active mover, 96 for everyone else — eviction only).
//!   Each record: feet-anchored center (Z = the **liquid surface** height), heading, `size0`,
//!   growth rate, lifetime, peak alpha, birth time.
//! - **Geometry is built ONCE, at emission**, from the wet liquid-lattice cells overlapping the
//!   record's *final* box (`size0 + growth·lifetime`) — which clips foam at banks. **Growth is
//!   pure texgen**: each frame the texture maps the box `[center ± size(t)]` to UV `[0,1]`,
//!   rotated to the heading; outside the box the stencil clamps to its transparent border (both
//!   foam textures have alpha-0 edges; sampler CLAMP — measured; the 0240 "GL_REPEAT tiling" was
//!   a misread). The shape *stretches* over a static patch as `size(t)` grows.
//! - **Alpha** rises to the peak over `0.4·L`, decays to 0 over `0.6·L`; the record dies at `L`.
//!   Vertex colour is flat white × that alpha; the **stencil's own near-black RGB is the
//!   intensity** (the reference fragment is a full MODULATE — measured in its FFP GLSL:
//!   `tex × diffuse` on RGB *and* A). Recolouring the stencil to white — 0234/0240's move — made
//!   the foam ~20× too bright; that was the blown-out white wedge.
//! - **Selection** (driver `0x5fa760`): translating (`MOVEMENTFLAGS & 0xf` — the avatar's real
//!   flags; a velocity proxy for streamed units) → WAKE, V-apex **along** the movement vector;
//!   turning in place (`& 0x30`) → full-size RING; standing → reduced RING (size ×0.6, growth
//!   ×0.25, alpha ×0.8); plus a one-shot full RING on the wade-depth crossing (`0x6030c0`).
//!   Emission gates on `depth < max(2·collisionHeight, 1.0)` — ≈4.06 yd for a human (decision
//!   0489: surface SWIMMING sits well inside the gate at its ~1.52-yd rest depth, so a floating
//!   or stroking swimmer keeps its ring/wake, matching the reference; only a real dive past
//!   ~2 body heights silences it) — with a linear attenuation past half. One shared per-unit
//!   cooldown cell paces both
//!   kinds: rings every 400–450 ms, wakes one per ~0.625 yd of travel (the byte cadence laws —
//!   the 0264 INTERIM constants are resolved, decision 0265).
//!
//! - **The patch sits ON the plane; its coplanar ties are settled in DEPTH, never by a lift**
//!   (B348, 1807/1808). A decal's verts are the plane's own, so it ties with the water surface
//!   everywhere and with the *terrain* along the shoreline, where the two cross. Lifting the patch
//!   in world space wins that tie and also moves the geometry — and on a beach a vertical lift is a
//!   horizontal overshoot: a decal `l` yards up keeps painting for `l / slope` yards past the
//!   waterline, on dry sand (0.10 yd at the 29 % Stranglethorn beach the defect was reported on,
//!   proportionally more on every flatter shore — measured with
//!   `benilla-formats --example water_here`). **The reference agrees**: `0x68fd0f` arms a
//!   depth-buffer bias and the foam vertices sit at the queried MCLQ height exactly, so there is no
//!   geometric lift in the binary to be faithful to (the "−2048 GL units" this file cited for a
//!   year is refuted; the real term is `footstepBias(0.125) × [0x810390]` = D3D `DEPTHBIAS −1/8192`).
//!   Ours needs no settle at all, and that is worth stating rather than assuming (1811): the patch
//!   is not a decal *over* the surface, it **is** the liquid mesh's own triangles — the same wet
//!   cells, the same winding, through the same `clip_from_world` (`DECAL_WORLD_CLIP`, 0781) as a
//!   mesh whose `Transform` is `IDENTITY` — so the depths agree exactly and `GreaterEqual` passes
//!   the tie unaided. [`Rung::FOAM_RASTER`] stays as a few ULPs of insurance against a driver
//!   rounding two pipelines differently; the **slope half is disarmed**, because its pull grows as
//!   z² and the only thing it can reach is the skirt of wet-cell geometry lying over dry sand.
//!
//! The formulas + lifecycle math live in [`params`]; this half is the ECS: the emitter over the
//! avatar + streamed units, the record pool, and one additive effect-stream draw per
//! (chunk, category) with live records (fog OFF — the reference's verified foam render state).
