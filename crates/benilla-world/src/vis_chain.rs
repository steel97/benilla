//! The visibility-chain-only idiom: entities that carry hide-propagation but never render.
//!
//! Bevy's visibility pipeline sweeps **every `ViewVisibility` row** three times a frame —
//! `reset_view_visibility` and `mark_newly_hidden_entities_invisible` once each, and
//! `check_visibility` once **per active camera** (its query takes `VisibilityClass` as an
//! `Option`, so carrying no renderable class does not exempt a row — verified in
//! bevy_camera 0.18.1, `visibility/mod.rs`). A second camera (the portrait booth) re-bills
//! the whole population.
//!
//! Most of our world entities that carry `Visibility` never render anything themselves: rig
//! anchors, joint entities, anim-host roots, tile roots, net-object roots, attachment
//! wrappers. They hold `Visibility` for one reason only — hide-propagation to renderable
//! *descendants* (a hidden unit must hide its weapon), and that chain runs entirely on
//! `Visibility` + `InheritedVisibility`. Their `ViewVisibility` row is pure sweep tax: at the
//! Goldshire pin it was ~6.7k of the 25.2k-row population (decision 1441).
//!
//! `Visibility` `#[require]`s `ViewVisibility`, so the component can't be left out at spawn —
//! it has to be removed right after. [`VisChainOnly::vis_chain_only`] is that removal, named:
//! chain a call onto the spawn of any never-rendering node. The inheritance chain stays whole
//! (B0004 validates `InheritedVisibility`, which stays), every `Mut`-write flip of
//! `Visibility` keeps working, and the row leaves all three sweeps.
//!
//! One trap this idiom creates: a later `.insert(Visibility::…)` on the same entity re-adds
//! `ViewVisibility` through the require machinery. Flip visibility on chain nodes through a
//! `Mut<Visibility>` write (as every cull authority already does), or re-strip after the
//! insert (see `transport.rs`, the one insert-based flip).
