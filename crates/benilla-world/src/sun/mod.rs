//! Celestial sprites — the **sun** (disc + glare halo), the **white moon** (disc + glare), and the
//! night-sky **stars**, drawn over the sky dome. Byte-pinned end to end by the wow-re celestial-bodies
//! §5 (decision 0485): setup `0x6d1ba0` builds six bodies (sun/moon glares, three discs, stars), the
//! builder `0x6d3b80` places each on a camera-centred sphere of radius 12 (`pos = cam + 12·dir`, world
//! space — no local→world rotation), `CSky::Render 0x6d4940` draws stars → sun → white moon → moon02
//! at a far depth slice with depth-write off (terrain occludes), and every disc routes through the
//! shared horizon clip+fade `0x6d1960`. This subsystem's plugin is [`SunPlugin`] (kept that name though
//! it covers every celestial body). Submodules, each its own concern:
//! - [`materials`] — the disc clip+fade [`materials::CelestialMaterial`] and the gamma-correct star material.
//! - [`mesh`] — pure quad / star-field / sprite-texture builders.
//! - [`setup`] — the startup spawn of every celestial entity.
//! - [`follow`] — the per-frame positioning, tinting, and fades.
//!
//! **The bodies** (all textures the real client's, from the patch chain):
//! - **Sun disc** — `sunCenter.blp`, plain alpha blend, a 1.0-unit quad at radius 12 (angular diameter
//!   `2·atan(0.5/12) = 4.77°`), size × the day curve (2× at the dawn/dusk horizon → 1× midday).
//! - **Sun glare** — `sunGlare.blp` (a big dark radial glow with authored star rays), additive,
//!   co-located; a **view-lerped lens flare** (`0x6cf490`): quad scale 3→20 world units as the view
//!   axis swings onto the sun (`f = saturate((cosθ − 0.7)/0.3)`), intensity `lerp(0.5, 1, f)` × the
//!   slewed dnCurve envelope — a DAY flare, full 07:30→19:30, gone by 21:00 (decision 0508).
//! - **White moon** — `moon.blp`, alpha blend, base ×1.75, up at night (azimuth 45°, the sun's bearing).
//! - **Moon glare** — `moonglare.blp` (a soft ring), additive, co-located; quad scale = `2.0 × the
//!   moon size curve` (≈1.14× the disc, both endpoints overwritten per frame), intensity
//!   `lerp(0.1, 1, f)` on the same view lerp × the slewed dnCurve envelope — a DEEP-NIGHT halo,
//!   nothing until 22:45, full only near midnight (decision 0508).
//! - **Stars** — the real `Stars.m2` patches, camera-anchored, global alpha = the star curve, each
//!   patch × its authored transparency weight.
//!
//! **The tint law** (the big 0485 correction): the discs' and glares' RGB is NOT hardcoded — the real
//! client broadcasts one DayNight **celestial diffuse** colour (`[0xce9c2c]` = LightIntBand sub-9,
//! resolved per zone + time; alpha forced 0xFF) into the sun disc, sun glare, white-moon disc, and
//! moon glare every frame. Warm cream at night, orange at dawn/dusk — the follow systems rewrite the
//! material tints per frame. The engine's third disc (`moon02.blp`) has NO colour writer in the
//! binary — it draws vertex-black at azimuth 135–165° on a phase-precessed schedule and can never
//! read as a second moon. The director's Westfall observation (one moon, a TEAL rim) is reproduced
//! NOT by any cool tint — the moon + its glare are warm — but by the dome's teal night bands
//! (sub-3..6) alpha-blending through the moon disc's feathered edge + horizon fade.
//!
//! The DISCS are pinned at their body directions (`WowLighting.{celestial_dir, moon_dir_white}`) just
//! inside the far plane, so terrain occludes them like the reference's far-depth-slice trick. The GLARE
//! quads sit on the reference's own **near sphere** (`cam + 12·dir` — a far-placed quad at the byte-law
//! flare size pierced the sky dome and the depth test cut a giant faceted halo edge; decision 0500);
//! their envelope, not the depth buffer, hides an occluded flare (the [`follow`] terrain/interior
//! visibility gate — the occlusion-query stand-in). Our camera fovy (45°) ≈ the reference's (44.1°), so
//! plain world placement reproduces its projection in both axes.
