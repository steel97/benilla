//! The per-instance body **TINT** — a unit's whole model multiplied by one colour (decision 0812):
//! the render channel for the aura state kit's CharProc 1 ([`crate::aura_visual`]), which had the
//! nodes modelled and nowhere to put them.
//!
//! **What it is in the reference.** A CM2 model instance carries two per-instance colour slots
//! beside its fade alpha (`model+0x180`): a **modulate** tint at `model+0x184/188/18c` (setter
//! `0x710cf0`, default `1,1,1`) and an **additive** highlight emissive at `+0x190/194/198`
//! (`0x710d40`, default `0,0,0`). benilla already carries the additive one — that is
//! [`crate::mesh_tag::HIGHLIGHT_BIT`], the hover/target brighten — because its colour is a single
//! config constant and fits in a flag bit. This module is its modulate sibling, which needs a real
//! per-instance RGB.
//!
//! **Where it lands in the draw (VERIFIED, wow-re `models/models.md`).** The animate kernel
//! `0x714260` derives `[ebx+0x1a0..0x1a8] = tint × inputColorA` per frame (per-channel `fmul` at
//! `0x7142cc`/`0x7142de`/`0x7142ed`); the batcher `0x70c3a9`–`0x70c4d3` clamps it to [0,1],
//! byte-packs `0xAARRGGBB` and issues gx **SetState(1, modulatedColor)** at `0x70c8ad`, which drives
//! the device-init `GL_COLOR_MATERIAL` / `GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE` current-colour path. So the tint
//! is the **material ambient+diffuse colour**: it multiplies the light sum *inside* the [0,1] clamp
//! and NOT the emission terms — structurally identical to what a WMO batch's MOCV already does in
//! `wow_model.wgsl`, which is where the shader multiplies it. With lighting off (an UNLIT batch) the
//! same state is a plain `glColor` modulate on the texture, so the fullbright path takes it too —
//! unlike the highlight, whose GL_EMISSION is dead there.
//!
//! (wow-re's `ghost-death-visuals.md` §4 still flags this combine as its one INFERRED hop and asks
//! for a models-node follow-up; `models.md` is that follow-up, and it is VERIFIED — two independent
//! traces plus gx's applicator-arm enumeration. We build on the verified note.)
//!
//! **The channel: no new `MeshTag` bits.** `MeshTag` bits 19..=29 already carry the instance's rig
//! slot ([`crate::rig_palette`]) — allocated per unit, written into every skinned part's tag at
//! spawn, and preserved by every runtime tag writer by construction. The vertex stage reads it to
//! index the palette region; the fragment stage now reads the *same* slot to index this table. That
//! is what makes the tint free of the bit budget the alpha and probe payloads fight over (5 spare
//! bits outdoors, **zero** indoors): it needs none.
//!
//! The rig field is safe to read on an unskinned instance because `WOW_RIG_SKIN` is keyed on the
//! mesh's vertex layout (`WowModelExt::specialize` tests `ATTRIBUTE_WOW_JOINT_INDEX`), never on the
//! tag — so a static mesh carrying a nonzero slot is not skinned by it, and the field is a plain
//! per-instance index. Slot **0** is the world's no-rig sentinel (terrain, WMO, doodads, clutter,
//! every unskinned part), so it is never written and always reads identity.
//!
//! **`0` means identity, and that is the client's own packing.** `0x60d840` builds the node value as
//! `round(param) | 0xff000000` (`0x60d8cc`) — an authored colour always carries a full alpha byte,
//! so a `0` word cannot be a real tint. A zeroed region is therefore a no-op by construction: the
//! portrait booths' studio buffers, slot 0, and every frame before anything is tinted all cost
//! nothing and change no pixel. The one shipped kit that authors a **black** body tint (spell 27200
//! Defile, kit 6531, `param0 = 0`) survives it, because we store `0xFF000000` for it, not `0`.
//!
//! **Not eased.** The reference applies the tint head node on *change* (`unit+0xd04`
//! change-detection → `×1/255` → `0x710cf0`), with none of the 1000 ms cubic ramp its sibling alpha
//! gets (`0x614f80`). A tint appears and disappears instantly, and that is faithful.
