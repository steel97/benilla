//! Background instrumented runs: probe/capture/regression windows that open *behind* the
//! director's work — and stay reachable once they're there.
//!
//! Agent-driven runs (captures, live probes, the rig, FPS journals) open a real window for
//! seconds to minutes on the same desktop the director is working on. Left alone, each launch
//! stole their focus twice over:
//!
//! - **Window-side** — the primary window opened focused (`makeKeyAndOrderFront`), swallowing
//!   whatever they were typing (on 2026-07-19 a login-shot run typed their keystrokes into the
//!   account box). `Window::focused = false` fixed that for capture/login-shot runs only; every
//!   live probe still opened key.
//! - **App-side (macOS)** — winit's AppKit backend unconditionally calls
//!   `activateIgnoringOtherApps` at `applicationDidFinishLaunching` and sets the Regular
//!   activation policy, so even an unfocused run activated the app: the menu bar switched and
//!   the window ordered in **front** of every other app's. bevy_winit 0.18 exposes no
//!   `EventLoopBuilderExtMacOS` hook to turn either off, so it can't be prevented — only undone,
//!   immediately after launch (decision 0703).
//!
//! Stealing the screen is a **launch-time event**, and only an event's worth of correction is
//! owed. 0703 paid for it with two *permanent* states, and the bill came due: with
//! `WindowLevel::AlwaysOnBottom` (`kCGNormalWindowLevel - 1`) the window could never be raised
//! above a normal one however hard you clicked it, and the Accessory activation policy struck it
//! from Cmd-Tab and the Dock. Every instrumented window was unreachable for its whole life, not
//! just polite at birth. Decision 0709 keeps both mechanisms — they are the right ones, and
//! Accessory in particular is doing more work than it looks (see [`macos::hand_back_activation`])
//! — but scopes them to the launch instead of the run:
//!
//! [`background_run`] detects an instrumented run from the env that drives it (no recipe or
//! script changes anywhere). `main` opens the window unfocused and below the normal level, so it
//! cannot flash over the director's work on the way up. [`BgWinPlugin`] then holds the launch:
//! Accessory policy, activation handed straight back to whatever they were using, and our window
//! ordered to the **back of the stack** — on screen, so surface rendering, readback and
//! screenshots are untouched, but behind their work. Once the launch goes quiet (half a second
//! with no activation landing on us; hard-capped at three seconds) it lets go in sequence —
//! window level back to Normal, policy back to Regular, one last order-to-back — and latches
//! shut. What's left is an ordinary window that Cmd-Tabs, clicks and raises like any other, for
//! as long as the run lasts.
