//! **The depth-prime twin** — the reference's `M2UseZFill` ("z-fill transparent objects", default
//! ON) reproduced for fading/stealthed entities (decision 0831; wow-re
//! `m2-blend-promotion-zfill.md` §4, VERIFIED at the bytes).
//!
//! The mechanism it reproduces: when a model instance draws translucent (`0 < A < 1` — stealth's
//! CharProc 0.3, the appear/despawn ramps, the self-avatar zoom feather), the reference's collector
//! CLONES each of its z-writing mesh commands into a twin that draws **first** (comparator key
//! `cmd+0x08` desc inside the instance's sort-key tie), **colour-masked off** (`glColorMask 0`),
//! **blend off**, **z-write ON**. The whole model's nearest-surface depth is therefore in the
//! buffer before any of its colour batches draw, each colour fragment passes the depth test only at
//! that nearest surface, and every interior/overlapped layer fails — **one blended layer
//! everywhere**. Without it, a stealthed body's overlapping parts compound `0.3` over `0.3` into
//! the darker patches of ledger B182.
//!
//! The benilla shape: [`sync_zfill_twins`] watches every fadeable part
//! ([`FadeMaterials::zfill`] carries the twin material, built next to the part's blend twin) and
//! keeps a **twin child mesh** alive on it exactly while the part's `MeshTag` alpha is translucent
//! ([`crate::mesh_tag::translucent`]). The twin shares the part's mesh, transform and tag (same
//! skinned pose, same rig slot), and its material's `specialize` masks the colour writes off and
//! forces z-write on; its ordering comes from the material's negative `Transparent3d` sort bias
//! ([`crate::model_render::ZFILL_SORT_BIAS`]).
//!
//! Two deliberate departures from the reference, both recorded in 0831:
//! - **Scope**: the reference twins every translucent mesh command always (authored-Blend glass
//!   included); we twin only while an instance alpha episode is live, so every steady-state look is
//!   untouched.
//! - **Ordering**: the reference ties one instance's commands to a single sort key and puts twins
//!   first inside the tie; Bevy sorts per-entity, so the twins ride a fixed −8 yd bias instead —
//!   transparent scene content sorting within that window behind a fading body draws after the
//!   prime and is depth-clipped where the body covers it, for the seconds the episode lasts.
