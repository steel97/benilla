//! World interaction foundation — *what is the player pointing at?*
//!
//! This is the shared base for every "point at the world" feature: the debug **object inspector**,
//! hover tooltips, the contextual cursor (gear over objects, sword over attackable units),
//! mouseover-targeting, and right-click-to-interact. Built once so we don't build picking +
//! identity twice.
//!
//! The pieces:
//! - [`WorldObject`] — an **identity** component on every pickable world entity (a doodad/WMO model, a
//!   creature, a GameObject): its kind, a human label (model path or unit name), an id, and an optional
//!   detail line. Attached at the spawn sites.
//! - the **ray caster** ([`pick`]) — the pick-geometry declarations ([`PickMesh`] / [`PickBox`]) and
//!   the shared triangle-accurate cast against the **actual resident mesh geometry** (so it works on
//!   colliderless props — most doodads, including the campfire — which a physics raycast misses),
//!   plus the generous inflated pass the mouse pick retries with (decision 1071).
//! - [`MouseoverTarget`] — the resource [`update_mouseover`] fills each frame with the nearest
//!   `WorldObject` under the cursor, for the inspector.
//!
//! The **instruments** built on this base — the dev-chord `I` inspector surface, the cast journal,
//! and the mouseover pick that only ever ran while the inspector was armed — live in
//! `debug_panel::{inspect, journal}` (decision 1160's stage zero). They were here first, and they
//! were what made this module read as the most entangled thing on the engine/game line: between
//! them they named the whole `target::cursor_mode` GO-reaction vocabulary, the spell catalog, the
//! GameObject templates, the name cache and the net writer. What remains here — identity, the
//! ray-caster and the three click gestures — reaches for none of it.
//!
//! The player-facing consumers (`crate::target`) run their picks through [`pick`] unconditionally.
//!
//! **Not every drawn thing has an entity** (decision 1534). The consolidating render lanes — the
//! static merge's blobs and the retained static pass — draw many placements as one thing, and the
//! per-placement entity that used to carry the declaration is gone. So the declaration has two more
//! shapes: [`PickBlob`] (members on the blob entity, for a lane that still draws from one) and
//! [`PickSource`] (the lane answers the ray itself, for one that draws from retained buffers).
//! [`WorldPick`] is the bundle that hands a consumer all three at once — reach for it, not for
//! [`PickParts`] alone, or the answer goes quiet over most of the static world.
