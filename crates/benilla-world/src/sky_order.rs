//! The celestial draw-order ladder — the reference's **fixed sky pass order**, expressed as
//! `Transparent3d` sort biases (wow-re `celestial-frame-anatomy`, §5-verified off the binary).
//!
//! The real client draws the frame `sky → opaque world → weather → glare`, and inside its sky pass
//! (`CSky::Render 0x6d4940`, one squashed depth slice `[0.975, 0.98]`, depth-write off, painter's
//! order): **stars → sun disc → white moon → moon02 → gradient strip (additive) → cloud dome** —
//! so the clouds composite over a setting sun, rain falls in front of the whole sky, and the glare
//! quads (their own back slice `[0.995, 1.0]`, the frame's LAST draw) paint over everything the
//! z-buffer leaves visible.
//!
//! Bevy instead sorts every transparent by `view-z of the mesh center + depth_bias`, drawn
//! back-to-front — and our celestial entities are camera-anchored, so their raw distances are
//! sort-order accidents (the camera-centred cloud dome sat at ~0 = drawn LAST, painting clouds
//! over rain and over the glare — backwards on both counts). These biases turn the accident back
//! into the reference's fixed order: spaced far below any real in-scene view-z (≳ −far plane, a
//! few ×10³) so world distances can never reorder the sky and every world transparent draws over
//! it, with the glare *above* zero so it draws after the world and the rain — but still below
//! [`Rung::NAMEPLATE`], which keeps world text on top of the flare (the
//! reference draws its text later still).
//!
//! Precipitation deliberately has NO bias: an unbiased view-z of a few tens of units lands rain
//! after the biased sky and before the glare — the reference's `weather` slot — without pinning
//! rain-vs-world-transparent order we have no byte law for.
//!
//! ## Which way the bias points — the sign, read off Bevy 0.18 (never guessed again)
//!
//! Every rung below is a *signed* number in one direction, and the direction was inverted here for
//! a week (decision 0639 — the whole ladder ran upside down; names sorted UNDER the water that
//! erased them). Verified in the bevy 0.18.1 sources, so the next edit can check rather than
//! recall:
//!
//! - `ViewRangefinder3d::distance` (`bevy_render/src/render_phase/rangefinder.rs`) returns the
//!   **view-space z** of the point — *negative* in front of the camera, and MORE negative the
//!   farther away (its own unit test puts points behind the eye at `+1`/`+2`).
//! - `Transparent3d` sorts **ascending** on that value (`bevy_core_pipeline/src/core_3d/mod.rs`:
//!   "Values increase towards the camera. Back-to-front ordering for transparent means we need an
//!   ascending sort") — so the first item drawn is the most negative = the farthest.
//! - The queue adds the material's bias to it (`bevy_pbr/src/material.rs`,
//!   `RenderPhaseType::Transparent`: `rangefinder.distance(&center) + depth_bias`).
//!
//! ⇒ **A POSITIVE bias draws LATER (on top); a NEGATIVE bias draws EARLIER (behind).** Bevy's own
//! `StandardMaterial::depth_bias` doc says it in words: "a positive depth bias will render closer
//! to the camera while negative values cause the material to render behind other objects".
//!
//! The magnitude is not free, because the same field is *also* the rasterizer's depth bias
//! (`bevy_pbr/src/pbr_material.rs` packs it into the pipeline key → `DepthBiasState::constant`,
//! applied in depth ULPs ≈ 2⁻²³ *relative*, the same knob [`crate::target::ring`] uses at 8192 to
//! beat coplanar noise). It is harmless for the sky rungs (every sky fragment overwrites its own
//! depth, below) but it perturbs the depth TEST of anything depth-tested, so the world-side rungs
//! stay as small as their ordering job allows.
//!
//! ## The depth law — every sky fragment forces the far depth
//!
//! The biases above order the sky *against itself*. What orders it against the **world** is depth,
//! and there the reference gives one rule for the whole pass: the sky draws FIRST, in a squashed
//! back slice (`[0.975, 0.98]`, the glare further back at `[0.995, 1.0]`), depth-write off — so the
//! opaque world simply paints over it, and no sky element can ever land in front of world geometry.
//!
//! Our sky draws *after* the world (Bevy's transparent pass), so the depth **test** has to do that
//! job — which it only does if the sky's depth is behind everything. Each shell used to rely on its
//! own camera-anchored radius for that (`far·0.85` discs, `far·0.87` clouds, `far·0.88` stars,
//! `far·0.9` gradient dome), on the assumption that world geometry is always nearer. **It isn't:**
//! the WDL horizon ring ([`crate::wdl`]) streams ±5 tiles ≈ 2.9 km and is drawn out to the far plane
//! (3 km), so distant hills land in a band *behind* every shell — and stars, clouds and discs then
//! passed the depth test in front of terrain the reference would have occluded them with (the
//! sighting: stars showing *through* a fogged mountain range at night, decision 0588).
//!
//! So every sky fragment now writes `SKY_FAR_DEPTH = 0.0` — reverse-Z "infinitely far" — under
//! Bevy's `GreaterEqual` test (`sky.wgsl`, `star.wgsl`, `cloud.wgsl`, `celestial.wgsl`, which
//! already did it for the glare). A sky element survives only where the depth buffer still holds
//! the clear value: exactly "the world paints over the sky", independent of any shell radius. The
//! shells now decide only *screen size and sky-internal parallax*, never occlusion.
