//! The collapsed rig's two composition passes (decision 0724) — what transform propagation and
//! the billboard joint pass used to do through ~59 k bone entities, done on the [`RigPose`]
//! arrays instead.
//!
//! **Model pass** ([`compose_rig_models`], pre-propagation): a pose-dirty rig forward-folds its
//! `locals` into model-space affines — **including the `flags & 0x7` parent-matrix arm**, which
//! needs nothing but model space (`RigPose::compose`) — and re-seats its consumer **anchors**
//! (children of the rig's `joints_root`) from them, so ordinary propagation carries every consumer
//! subtree (held items, nested effect rigs, the mount seat) at this frame's pose, exactly as the
//! joint hierarchy did. Runs after [`PosePost`] (body twist, global sequences — the writers that
//! follow the evaluator).
//!
//! **World pass** ([`finalize_rig_worlds`], post-propagation, inside
//! [`crate::billboard::BillboardPlace`]): per rig needing it — pose-dirty, `joints_root` moved,
//! or camera-faced — compose the chain `world_from_model × local…` **with the root's translation
//! zeroed** (decision 0974: the whole chain runs rig-relative, because composing it at the map's
//! ~9.5 k-yard coordinates spent an f32 ULP — ~1 mm — per matmul, freshly every frame), apply the
//! byte-law bone replacements (`billboard_joint_palette`'s math verbatim: the arm again, in its
//! world-space form, then billboard kinds take the camera basis, and descendants chain onto the
//! replaced frames), write the palette rows (`frame × inverse_bindpose`, decision 0720) beside the
//! rig's world origin (which the vertex stage adds back camera-relative), and re-seat the
//! anchors sitting on replaced subtrees — including the same rigid-child re-walk and the same
//! nested-rig do-not-enter rule as the entity pass. A re-seated subtree that carries another
//! rig's model frame (the mounted rider's seat anchor, [`RigFrame`]) cascades: that rig
//! re-finalizes in the same pass, so its palette never lags its seat.
//!
//! The arm appearing in BOTH passes is not a double application — each pass builds its own chain
//! once, in its own space, and the two agree (see `RigPose::compose`). What it is NOT allowed to
//! be is world-pass-only: the anchors are seated from the model pass, so an arm that ran only
//! afterwards left every attached subtree riding the un-armed frame (decision 0945).
//!
//! A parked, stationary rig runs neither pass and uploads zero bytes (decision 0448's park
//! observables carry over unchanged).
