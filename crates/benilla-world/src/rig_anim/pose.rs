//! The direct M2 pose evaluator (decision 0712): turn each rig's `AnimationPlayer` state into
//! bone `Transform`s ourselves, off the baked [`PoseSource`], instead of routing per-bone entities
//! through Bevy's `animate_targets` (0711's second lane — ~1.9 µs *per bone* of graph-walk +
//! hash-lookup + boxed-curve machinery to produce, for most bones, a constant).
//!
//! The player stays the playback state machine — the driver's arms, cross-fades, weights, seeks,
//! and completions are untouched — and this system reproduces `animate_targets`' *output* exactly
//! (the goldens below run both side by side and assert bone-for-bone equality). The law, read from
//! `bevy_animation-0.18.1` and pinned in 0712: per (bone, property), active nodes contribute in
//! **ascending node-index order**, folded by `total += w; acc = interpolate(acc, v, w/total)`
//! (`Vec3::lerp` / `Quat::slerp` — the same `Animatable` calls, so the math is bit-identical); a
//! node contributes iff its weight ≠ 0 and `bone_masks[bone] & node_mask == 0` and its clip keys
//! the channel; sampling clamps into the key span; a property no active clip keys is left alone
//! (there is no rest-pose reset — the joint keeps what it has). Paused animations still evaluate
//! at their frozen seek, exactly as Bevy does.
//!
//! Parking (decision 0448) is the [`AnimParked`] marker: a parked rig is skipped here — clocks,
//! driver, and events all keep running — which preserves 0448's two observables (absolute-clock
//! snap on wake, off-screen combat audibility) with no `AnimatedBy` repoint machinery.
