//! **`WOW_MERGE_CENSUS=1` — the production-merge population census** (decision 1417: "the
//! census comes first").
//!
//! Tallies every batch the streamer walks through `spawn_model_entities` into the population
//! classes 1417's lane-1 predicate carves — anim-excluded / interior prop / WMO vs doodad ×
//! order-free vs transparent × never-fade vs fader — and prints the table once the stream has
//! been quiet for two seconds. The point is to read lane 1's yield (and every later lane's
//! go/no-go) off a live pin instead of a prior: 0922's ~40% transparent share and the
//! bracket's 21k-row delta are the numbers this either confirms or replaces.
//!
//! Statics + a quiet-timer logger, not plumbed state: the tally site is deep in the assembler
//! (which already threads eleven parameters), and this is a dev reading at a parked pin, not
//! a production mechanism — the same trade `WOW_HIT_COST` made. Wall-clock quiet is likewise
//! fine HERE (contrast the bracket's same-shaped flush timer, which 1417 retires for
//! production in favour of the weld's close rule).
