//! The **skybox** — an authored sky model that stands in for the `Light.dbc` gradient dome, drawn
//! camera-anchored in the sky slice.
//!
//! **Two sources feed one lane, and the DBC source wins.** A *building* asks for its own painted sky
//! (the **MOSB**/`0x40000` mechanism derived below); the *death profile* asks for the ghost sky
//! (`LightSkybox.dbc` via `LightParams.lightSkyboxID`, [`benilla_formats::LightCatalog::ghost_skybox`]).
//! The reference keeps these in separate slots — the WMO's is loop slot A, the DBC's is the single
//! slot B — and slot B, whose weight is hardcoded `1.0` whenever it is filled, makes
//! `0x6d4ac1`–`0x6d4acc` skip loop A entirely: **an active DBC skybox suppresses the WMO one
//! outright** (byte-VERIFIED, wow-re `lighting/scratch/wmo-skybox.md` §3–4). Here that is one
//! `Option` with the DBC source taken first, because a resolve that produced both would have to
//! decide anyway and the binary has already decided.
//!
//! A WMO root can name a skybox model in its **MOSB** chunk, and a group can ask for it with group
//! flag **`0x40000`**. Both halves matter, and the flag is tested **on the groups the portal flood
//! REACHES, never on the group the camera stands in** — `0x6b42e0` sits inside the flood `0x6b41c0`
//! with `ebx` = the group being *visited*, seeded from the containment list on the inside leg and
//! from every frustum-visible EXTERIOR group on the outside leg (`0x6b3dd0`), recursing through
//! portals at `0x6b4639` and re-testing at each step. The predicate is therefore
//! *"any flood-reached group carries the bit, and the root names a MOSB"*, published to `[0xca8080]`
//! and read once at `0x681282`.
//!
//! **That distinction is load-bearing, and getting it wrong is what shipped first.** In Stratholme's
//! King's Square the camera stands in group 39 — the root's *only* EXTERIOR (`0x8`) group, which does
//! **not** set `0x40000`. A containing-group test draws no skybox there; the reference draws the
//! painted red sky, because 61 of the 83 groups its flood reaches from group 39 do carry the bit.
//! (Checked on the asset: a BFS over `Stratholme_B`'s MOPR reaches 82 of 83 groups from group 39.)
//! The corpus correlation that seeded the first attempt — across all 815 roots the bit never appears
//! without a MOSB, 0 counter-examples (`benilla-extract skyboxscan`) — was true and still is; it just
//! never established *which* group the renderer tests, and it was over-read as if it had.
//!
//! Five roots exercise both halves: **`Stratholme_B`**, the burning city, and the four Caverns of
//! Time shells — which are *not* out of reach in 1.12, whatever the instance portals do.
//! `CavernsofTime.wmo` is placed in the live world at Kalimdor tile (39, 47), MODF `uniqueId`
//! 398759, and standing in the crater at `.go xyz -8437.16 -4222.44 -211.58 1` the cull's down-ray
//! seeds group 29 (`flags 0x42805` — `SHOW_SKYBOX` set) and this resolve fires. An earlier note here
//! read "unreleased" as "unreachable" and concluded this branch never actually picks; the director
//! walked into it.
//!
//! Four more roots name a skybox no group ever asks for (DireMaul's
//! instance shell, `Stratholme_A`, and the two Sunken Temple roots — whose MOSB isn't even a model
//! path, it's the string "the temple of atal'hakkar"), so keying off the chunk alone would still
//! paint skies the reference never shows. This is why Stratholme's sky is red where the zone light
//! says otherwise: map 329's only reachable `Light.dbc` atmosphere (global row 341 → `LightParams`
//! 336) is a khaki-brown gradient with a near-black apex, and it is not what draws in there.
//!
//! **A skybox is an ordinary M2, and is drawn as one** (decision 1264). This lane used to have a
//! private mesh builder and a private material — positions, UVs, one texture, everything opaque —
//! which is a faithful drawing of `StratholmeSkybox.m2` (three opaque batches × 8 verts, one texture
//! pair per axis, no animation) and of nothing else. `CavernsOfTimeSky.m2` is the counter-example the
//! chain also ships: **21 batches across four blend modes** — a painted cube, six ADDITIVE star
//! sheets on the cube's own faces, five alpha-blended planet cards, three alpha-tested asteroid belts
//! on rotating bones. Drawn opaque, the star sheet — whose RGB is near-white and whose stars live in
//! its ALPHA channel — paints a flat white sheet over the painted sky, and the planets and belts
//! become dark cards. That is the director's *"the whole ceiling is white … some of the cool effects
//! seem missing"* in Caverns of Time.
//!
//! So the batches go through [`crate::model_render`]'s material lane like every other model
//! ([`M2BatchMaterials::skybox`]), which is where the blend law, the 224/255 alpha-key reference, the
//! additive gamma premultiply and the authored batch order already live, byte-verified. Three things
//! are the *sky's* and are set here, not read off the batch: the forced far depth, depth-write off,
//! and depth-test on — the rationale is on `skybox()`.
//!
//! Occlusion is **not** the box's radius: like every sky element it forces the far depth (the law is
//! in [`crate::sky_order`]), so the world paints over it and the shell is free to sit inside the
//! room's own geometry.
//!
//! **Scope — the skybox replaces the WHOLE celestial pass, not just the backdrop.** `CSky::Render`
//! carries one shared boolean (`0x6d49cd` sets it, `0x6d49fb`/`0x6d4a2e` clear it once any slot's
//! weight exceeds `[0x808aac]` = 0.99) and `0x6d4a3b test edi,edi; je` skips **all six** element
//! draws together — stars, sun disc, both moons, gradient band and cloud dome. There is no
//! per-element gating. Confirmed in a live GL capture of the reference standing in King's Square:
//! the entire `[0.975, 0.98]` sky slice is three `count=12` draws (the cube's three texture pairs)
//! and nothing else, identically in every frame. Only the **glare** quads survive — they render on
//! their own later path (`0x483740 → 0x6d48c0 → 0x7e57e0`), outside this pass.
//!
//! What the atmosphere drives (fog colour and distance, ambient, diffuse) is still untouched: no byte
//! law says the flag reaches it, and the reference fogs the world normally underneath the painted sky.

/// gradient dome, minus its far-plane scaling.
///
/// The art is drawn at **authored scale** and that is deliberate. Every other shell here scales to a
/// fraction of the far plane, but those radii were only ever standing in for occlusion, and the forced
/// far depth ([`crate::sky_order`], "The depth law") retired that job. Scale is genuinely free here:
/// the eye's offset inside the box scales with the box, so the *angles* the faces subtend — which is
/// all a camera-anchored backdrop can show — are scale-invariant.
///
/// **The ANCHOR POINT is not free — and it is the model's ORIGIN, VERIFIED.** `CM2Model+0xbc` stays
/// identity and `0x707680` is called with a **zeroed** recentre vector (`0x6d4b3a`–`0x6d4b48`) where
/// the world M2 scene gets the live camera position — so the model's local origin sits exactly at the
/// eye, with camera rotation and zero translation. (The capture agrees: the skybox's matrix is
/// orthonormal with translation `(0,0,0)` while the very next model's carries a real offset.)
///
/// It matters because `StratholmeSkybox` is *not* centred on its origin: its 52.87 yd cube sits at
/// z ∈ [−14.67, +38.20], leaving the eye 11.76 yd BELOW the box's centre. That asymmetry is authored,
/// not incidental — the near-black ±Z pair covers only a **34.7°** cone about the zenith rather than
/// a symmetric 45°, and the side pairs' painted horizon lands three-quarters down their gradient
/// (v ≈ 0.72). Re-centring the box on the eye would be a visible change and a wrong one.
/// A spinning batch ([`SkyboxSpin`]) composes its bone's rotation about the bone's own pivot INSIDE
/// the anchor: `T(eye) · T(pivot) · R(t) · T(−pivot)`, which closes to the rotation itself plus the
/// translation below. The pivot conjugation is not decoration — Caverns of Time's belt bones pivot
/// ~3 yd off the model origin, and the eye sits AT that origin ~20 yd from the belt, so dropping it
/// swings the whole ring through several degrees instead of turning it in place.
///
/// The clock is the scene's own elapsed time, wrapped by the sequence. **The phase origin is not
/// byte-pinned** — the reference arms the model at load and samples a shared clock, so its phase is
/// whatever the room's load moment was — and for a 66.7 s loop of an asteroid ring with no start
/// event, phase is unobservable. Captures never reach here at all (the spin component is not
/// attached under a deterministic run), so no golden frame depends on it.
