//! **One-sided movement collision** — the reference's facing law, applied at the only seam where it
//! can live: per candidate triangle, inside the sweep.
//!
//! The real client's movement collision is an orientation-blind gather followed by a strictly
//! one-sided resolver: `0x671cc0` emits every candidate face's plane at the **unflipped file
//! winding**, and `0x632700` opens each record with `dot = n·dir` against `[0x80c5c4]`
//! (`0xb727c5ac` = −9.99999975e-6) — **a face is processed iff `n·dir ≤ −1e-5`**. A face approached
//! from its back is discarded before any distance is computed, and this is not a wall-slide special
//! case: the 16 callers of `0x632ba0 earliest_contact` span falling, walking, step-up, ground-settle,
//! transports and the water-surface arm — "the surface you stand on is filtered exactly like the wall
//! you slide along" (decision 0967, wow-re `collision/scratch/wmo-movement-group-gate.md`; confirmed
//! at B86's exact pin in decision 0968). parry's trimesh is two-sided by construction, which is why
//! benilla stood on CoT's inward-wound shell where 1.12.1 falls through it.
//!
//! Why this is a mirrored loop and not a post-filter: a shape cast reports only the *first* hit. If
//! that hit is a backface, the correct result is the next front-face hit *behind* it — information a
//! finished cast no longer has. So the gate must run where candidates are enumerated, and avian's
//! enumeration (`cast_shape_predicate`, `contact_manifolds`) carries no triangle identity out. This
//! module therefore re-runs avian's own `move_and_slide` algorithm — same iteration structure, same
//! skin-width pull-back, same depenetration solver (`depenetrate_intersections`), same velocity
//! projection — over its public building blocks, walking each trimesh's BVH itself so every triangle
//! is gated on its **authored winding** before it may block. `Collider::trimesh` stores vertices and
//! indices exactly as passed (parry `TriMeshFlags::empty()`), and every transform between the file
//! and the collider is a proper rotation (decision 0968), so `TriMesh::triangle(i)`'s winding *is*
//! the authored winding.
//!
//! What is ported is the **law**, not the reference's resolver: the slide/step/snap machinery stays
//! the standard kinematic controller (that direction was closed in 0207), contact normals for edge
//! hits stay parry's, and convex (non-trimesh) colliders stay whole-shape — a convex volume has no
//! reachable backface. The camera/LOS path is untouched *on purpose*: the reference's segment
//! kernel `0x7c29f0` is two-sided (0967), so avian's ordinary cast is already faithful there.
//!
//! **There is no depenetration pass, and that is the law too** (decision 2018). avian's
//! `move_and_slide` opens and closes with a Gauss–Seidel push-out of every face the shape overlaps;
//! the reference's resolver has no such stage anywhere in `0x634040`'s closure. Its world query is a
//! time-of-impact sweep and nothing else: a face the prism starts *behind* by more than 1/36 yd
//! (`[0x7ff9c8]`, the backface band in `0x632830`'s clip) is not a hit at all, one it straddles is a
//! hit at `t = 0` that the slide projects against, and neither ever *moves* a body that asked to go
//! nowhere. The push-out was benilla's, and it is what shoved a seated body sideways off its stool:
//! the server seats a player at a chair's origin, inside the chair's own collision box, and the
//! minimum-translation vector for a tall capsule inside a small box is horizontal — out through the
//! nearest side (B359, measured at 0.555 yd on the first frame, with no input). A body that starts
//! inside geometry leaves it the way the reference does: by walking out through the faces wound
//! away from it, which the sweep never counts.
