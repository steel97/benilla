//! **The exterior scene draws only through doorways you can see.**
//!
//! Standing inside a WMO interior, the reference does not draw the outdoor world at large — it draws
//! it once per *portal window* left over by the interior portal flood, with the view frustum narrowed
//! to that window. We drew it unconditionally, which is why a hillside tree 200 yd outside Stratholme
//! showed through the city's walls (the director's report; wow-re
//! `system/terrain/scratch/interior-exterior-scene-cull.md`, decision 0774).
//!
//! ## The carved law
//!
//! The world-scene driver `0x681070` branches at `0x681101` on `[0xc7b748]`, the camera-containing map
//! object (0 = outdoors):
//!
//! - **Outside leg** (`0x6811ca`): one populate walk `0x682fa0` against the literal full-screen rect
//!   `{0, 0, 1, 1}` — the ordinary frustum. [`ExteriorWindows::Unrestricted`].
//! - **Inside leg** (`0x681120`): the flood leaves a deferred window worklist (count `[0xcbe320]`,
//!   records `0xcbe324`, stride `0x14`), which the driver `rep movsd`s into `0xc7cb7c` (`0x68118b`)
//!   and then walks **once per window** (`0x682fa0`), frustum narrowed to that window's rect.
//!   **`0x681199 jbe 0x681204` skips the entire walk when the count is zero** — a sealed room draws no
//!   exterior at all.
//!
//! `0x682fa0` is the *only* producer for every exterior bucket — ADT terrain (`0x683bf0`), ADT doodads
//! (`0x683700`), the second placement walk (`0x683340`), world WMO placements (`0x6856c0`), all three
//! liquid layers (`0x683ab0`) and the far band (`0x683040`) — and each drain unlinks what it walks. So
//! "no window" really does mean "no exterior content", with no second path to leak through.
//!
//! ## Bodies ride the same walk — the correction 0774 needed (decision 1270)
//!
//! 0774 read this lane one stage too late and wrote the opposite: *"units are exempt and must stay
//! exempt … the reference submits outdoor mobs from a sealed room and lets the building's own
//! geometry z-reject them."* The **drain** fact it checked is true — `0x483460`/`0x48368a` walk the
//! M2Scene worklist with zero references to `[0xc7b748]`/`[0xcbe320]` — but the decision is taken
//! *before* the worklist, in the driver that does read them.
//!
//! Every frame `0x683dd0` (sole caller `0x6812c5`, inside `0x681070`) elects each scene object into
//! one of two passes: `[record+0xb4]` is `0x481540` and nothing else (that dword occurs once
//! image-wide, at `0x613ece`), and `CGObject::ShouldRender` is literally `0x6146c6: and eax,1`.
//! Pass 2 takes `0x48161f je` → `0x48174e call 0x710c50`, which writes `[model+0x50] = 0`: the model
//! never enters `[scene+0x24]`, the only list the draw loop `0x707680`/`0x707882` walks — and walk 2
//! also skips `0x710b90`, so a pass-2 object is neither drawn nor ticked.
//!
//! **List A's only outdoor producer is `0x683340`, whose only caller is `0x682fe2` — inside
//! `0x682fa0`**, the per-window exterior walk above. A sealed room never runs it, so `0x680390`
//! sweeps every outdoor object in the world into pass 2. Nothing is submitted, so there is nothing
//! for the building's geometry to z-reject: 0774's second claim fails in both halves. An object
//! standing in a WMO group rides the sibling `0x6834e0` instead, which is why a creature in the
//! camera's own room still draws.
//!
//! So a body is exterior scene exactly when it is not in a WMO room, and the windows gate it like
//! the ground it stands on — [`WorldUnit::bound`].
//!
//! ## The clip geometry
//!
//! Per window, the reference bilerps the camera's four global corner rays (`0xc7bcd8`) by the window's
//! rect into 8 corners, and `0x6865f0`→`0x686640` builds **6 planes** from them. So the clip volume is
//! a **sub-frustum whose cross-section is the portal's screen-space AABB** (accumulated along the
//! portal chain), *not* its polygon — and the test is **per object, whole AABB** (`0x682f40`), never
//! per primitive. There is no scissor rect and no user clip plane anywhere on the path: a doodad
//! straddling the doorway edge is drawn **whole**, and the silhouette comes from the interior geometry
//! in front of it.
//!
//! We build the same volume the cheap way: an NDC rect is a scale+offset on clip space, so
//! `sub_clip_from_world = rect_to_ndc * clip_from_world` and Bevy's own
//! [`Frustum::from_clip_from_world`] extracts the identical 6 planes. That keeps us on one
//! plane-extraction implementation instead of a private corner-ray port.
//!
//! Windows narrower than [`MIN_WINDOW_NDC`] in either axis are dropped, matching the reference's
//! `[0x8029d0]` reject.
//!
//! ## What is gated so far, and what is knowingly not
//!
//! **Gated:** ADT terrain (`0x683bf0`), ADT doodad placements (`0x683700`), the WDL far band
//! (`0x683040`) and now the net **bodies** on `0x683340` ([`WorldUnit::bound`]) — the buckets that produce
//! the reported symptoms, and the ones whose entities have no other `Visibility` writer, so this is
//! their sole authority (decision 0025).
//!
//! **The unit is the drawn object, and for terrain that is the 33.333 yd MCNK cell, not the 533 yd
//! tile** (decision 0780). This is a property of the *spawner*, not of anything here — but the cull is
//! where it bites: a tile-sized box always contains the camera's own ground, so it intersects every
//! window and is admitted whichever way the doorway faces. The cull was correct and looked broken.
//! The far band keeps its whole-tile box, which is the reference's own far-tier granularity.
//!
//! **NOT yet gated, deliberately:** world **WMO placements** (`0x6856c0`) and open-world **liquid**
//! (`0x683ab0`). Both already have a visibility authority — WMO group submeshes are written by the
//! portal PVS apply, liquid by its own lane — and bolting a second writer onto the same entities is
//! precisely the two-authorities bug 0025 forbids. Folding them in means teaching *those* authorities
//! to consume [`ExteriorWindows`], which is a real design step and not a line to sneak in here. Until
//! then a distant building or lake still shows through a wall where the reference would hide it.
//!
//! **Deviation to be honest about:** the reference tests one AABB per *object*; a doodad placement has
//! no root entity in our graph, so we tag and test each **submesh**. Their union is the object, so the
//! only divergence is at a doorway's edge — a submesh entirely outside the window is dropped where the
//! reference would draw the doodad whole. Visible only as a partially-clipped prop in a doorway.
//! A body does not take that deviation: it has a root, so it is tested once, whole ([`ElectedBody`]).
