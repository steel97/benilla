//! **The straddle split** — a translucent model that crosses its water plane draws on BOTH sides
//! of the water pass, each copy cut at the waterline (decision 2188; wow-re
//! `terrain/scratch/water-frame-straddle.md` §2, byte-VERIFIED).
//!
//! **The reference.** The collector (`0x707680`) dots each model's bound-box centre (instance
//! matrix × `(min+max)/2`) against the plane `{0,0,1,−surfaceZ}` from the model's own liquid hit,
//! once per instance. With `M2UseClipPlanes` granted — the cvar's default `"1"`, caps-gated at
//! `0x7066a6` — it keeps TWO side booleans, `A = d ≥ −r` (the above list) and `B = d ≤ r` (the
//! below list), `r` the world-scaled bound radius. A model inside the `±r` band lands on BOTH
//! lists, its z-fill depth primes ride the same booleans (`0x707ffe`/`0x708048`), and the mesh
//! draw arm brackets each list's copy with a hardware clip plane at the waterline (`0x70baf0`
//! @`0x70c094`–`0x70c103`). The frame interleave draws the eye's far list before the water and the
//! near list after it (0911) — so the half under the surface is painted over by the water, and the
//! half above it paints over the water.
//!
//! **What benilla had.** The mesh lane (0919) shipped the no-clip-planes fallback only — one list
//! per model, a bare sign test at the placement origin — and named the band as a gap. Its worst
//! case was a unit fading in while standing in water (the director's report, 2026-09-11): the
//! appear ramp puts every part on its blend twin, which is exactly when the lane classifies it;
//! feet under the surface sent the WHOLE body to the far list; and because the fade twin and the
//! depth prime both write depth, the part above the water primed its depth before the water drew.
//! A body-shaped hole in the surface, with the head blended over the unwatered lake bed behind it
//! — strongest at the ramp's start, where the body is least opaque.
//!
//! **The shape here — three pieces, one verdict:**
//! - [`band_instances`] — per model instance (a root carrying a [`RigSkin`] slot and a
//!   [`WorldUnit`] bound), the reference's two booleans at the transformed bound centre. A
//!   straddler's plane goes into the per-slot [`WaterClips`] table — a region of the shared light
//!   buffer on the same slot index as the body tint (0812) — and [`ModelWaterBand`] on the root is
//!   the edge the classifier fans down from.
//! - `model_render::classify_water_side` reads the SAME table word by the batch's `MeshTag` slot:
//!   a straddling batch stays on its NEAR identity and is marked [`StraddlesWater`], and
//!   [`sync_straddle_twins`] hangs a child on it carrying the FAR twin — the second list.
//! - `wow_model.wgsl`'s `WOW_WATER_CLIP` block (every transparent-pass pipeline) is the clip plane:
//!   a fragment of a straddling instance survives only on its own copy's side — the near copy
//!   keeps the eye's half, the far twin (`FAR_SIDE_MARKER`) the other. [`keeps`] is the law's Rust
//!   twin.
//!
//! The CPU twin set and the GPU clip read one word, so they cannot disagree: a batch is doubled
//! exactly when its fragments are being halved.
//!
//! **Scope: slot-bearing instances.** The clip is per INSTANCE, and the one per-instance channel
//! the fragment stage has is the rig slot — so the split covers every skinned wire body (units,
//! players, rigged GameObjects), the parts carrying its slot (boneless geosets, billboard cards),
//! and every model CHAINED to it — worn gear and hung spell kits, which own slots of their own
//! since 1609 and take the body's word through their `ParentModel` link (decision 2190). Slot-0
//! content — map doodads, unskinned models — keeps 0919's one-sided fallback; its only
//! translucent episodes are the distance-fade ring's small props.
