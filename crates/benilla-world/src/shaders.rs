//! **The engine's WGSL, compiled into the binary** (decision 1175).
//!
//! The seven shaders under `src/shaders/` are the *engine's* — 1171's line, unchanged: the game's
//! five live in `benilla-app`, and `embedded_asset!` is per-crate by construction, so the seam
//! costs nothing to keep.
//!
//! Until 1175 these were served from a file asset root that `boot.rs` baked as
//! `concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/assets")` — an absolute path into the *build* machine's
//! source tree. On any other machine it resolves to nothing and the world renders with no shaders
//! at all: the "silently-no-shaders trap" `capture/mod.rs`'s header already named. Embedding is
//! what makes the binary answer for its own content; `benilla-assets` has done it for its four
//! since it had them, and this is the same move for the other twelve.
//!
//! **Why these calls live in a file directly under `src/`.** `embedded_asset!` derives the served
//! path by stripping everything up to and including the crate's `src/` from `file!()`, then
//! re-prefixing the crate name — and it does **not** normalize the result. Called from
//! `src/sun/materials.rs` the shader would land at `embedded://benilla_world/sun/…`, and reaching
//! back out with `"../shaders/x.wgsl"` would bake a literal `..` component into the virtual
//! directory. One registration point at the root of `src/` is what keeps every path
//! `embedded://benilla_world/shaders/<name>.wgsl`.
