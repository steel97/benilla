//! The terrain streamer — the world's sole terrain owner, built on `benilla-assets`.
//!
//! It **streams** the ground around the player through the standard `AssetServer` (the `mpq://` source +
//! `AdtLoader`): it loads a `Handle<AdtTile>` for every tile in range and drops it when the tile leaves
//! range — so residency, async loading, the decode cache, and refcounted unloading are all the engine's
//! job now, not a bespoke worker/finalize pipeline. Per loaded tile it spawns: the merged terrain mesh +
//! splat [`TerrainMaterial`]; an avian static terrain collider (a trimesh from the same merged mesh,
//! riding the tile entity's lifecycle); the doodad/WMO placements (from `Handle<M2Model>`/`Handle<WmoModel>`,
//! deduped by the `AssetServer`, each with its own static collider entity, with the same
//! [`WowModelMaterial`] + [`DoodadFade`] components the legacy path used — so the existing
//! visibility/fade/lighting systems govern them unchanged); the MCLQ water surfaces; and the ground
//! clutter (scattered per chunk into `ClutterChunk`s the shared `stream_chunk_clutter` builds lazily).
//! It also publishes loading-screen residency. Current-map directory + id come from
//! [`CurrentMap`]/[`MapCatalogRes`] ([`crate::world_map`]); the clutter catalog + build lifecycle from
//! [`crate::clutter::ClutterPlugin`].
