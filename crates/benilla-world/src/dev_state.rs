//! The dev **state** — resource-only, no egui: the per-subsystem toggles the render and gameplay
//! systems read, with **player-faithful defaults** (fog on, dome on, everything visible, follow
//! the server clock, no weather override). Decision 0026's "config out of the editor": this file
//! is the always-present layer; the debug panel is only the *editor* that writes it. When the
//! compile-time `dev` seam lands (0026's deferred phase), this module stays in a player build —
//! the defaults ARE the player behaviour — and only the egui surfaces gate out.
//!
//! It was `debug_panel::state` until decision 1164. Living inside the panel's module made the
//! panel look like the owner of config eight other subsystems read, and it was the second reason
//! `DebugPanelPlugin` had to be inside the engine's plugin group — the first being the model
//! `Visibility` authority, now `model_render`'s. With both out, the panel is an instrument again
//! and the engine boots without it, which is what `benilla-worldview` is for.
