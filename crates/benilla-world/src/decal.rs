//! The shared world-surface **decal projector** — the reference's own ground-decal mechanism
//! (wow-re selection-circle RE §2 + unit-blob-shadow RE, the `0x6d7330` → `0x6d6fa0` matrices →
//! `0x6d7480` emit chain): gather the triangles of every [`GroundDecalSurface`] collider (terrain
//! tiles + WMO faces — **never** doodads/GameObjects) whose BVH overlaps a projection box, clip
//! each to the box ([`clip_to_frame`]), and emit them with planar top-down UVs. Because the
//! emitted triangles are exact sub-pieces of the drawn surfaces, a decal is pixel-coplanar with
//! what's on screen — **provided it transforms through the same `clip_from_world` matrix as the
//! world-mesh shaders** (the `DECAL_WORLD_CLIP` lane variant; the cam-relative route reaches
//! the same plane through different arithmetic and misses by more than the bias at WoW-scale
//! coordinates — decision 0781), the rasterizer `depth_bias` settling the depth test — and
//! drapes down
//! steps and ledge faces precisely like the reference (a vertical face gets the smeared texel
//! column of its XZ spot: projective texturing, faithfully).
//!
//! Since 0733 the projector emits **effect-stream triangles** ([`EffectVertex`], world-space,
//! fan-unrolled) instead of `Mesh` assets: its clients cache the projected slice and push it
//! into the shared lane per frame — zero mesh churn, tint/fade applied at push time.
//!
//! Three clients — the same emit loop in the binary: the **selection ring**
//! ([`crate::target`]`::ring`, collector flags `0x200122`), the **unit blob shadow**
//! ([`crate::blob_shadow`], flags `0x2f0122` — the ring's + the liquid receivers, a gap here:
//! liquid surfaces aren't in the [`GroundDecalSurface`] set yet), and the ground-fx spell
//! decals ([`crate::ground_fx`]).
