//! **Within-map art residency** — the distance half of decision 0729's map-scope teardown.
//!
//! 0729 gave the world-art dedup caches a *reset point*: a cross-map transition clears them, and the
//! loading screen pays for the rebuild. B131 is the case that argument does not reach — a long flight
//! **inside** one map never fires that transition, so nothing ever evicts and `mats`/`images` ratchet
//! for as long as you stay on a continent (decision 0785's open half: 26.8 k materials / 2.8 k images
//! after ten minutes here; 3.2 → 4.9 GiB of VRAM on the reporter's tour).
//!
//! This module turns clear-on-*transition* into clear-on-*distance*: every cache entry remembers the
//! view focus it was last used from, and a sweep drops what was last wanted more than
//! [`DEFAULT_RADIUS_YD`] away. So residency is bounded by *where you are*, not by how long the process
//! has run, and the map-change clear stays exactly as it was — the hard reset on top of the soft one.
//!
//! **Distance decides what expires; a dwell floor decides how soon.** [`MIN_DWELL_SECS`] exists
//! because the radius alone is sized for gameplay speed — the detached free-fly camera crosses it in
//! five seconds and would lose a city's dedup only to rebuild it on the way back (found on the
//! director's first real run; see the constant).
//!
//! **Distance, not a TTL**, and the difference is safety rather than taste: a time-expired entry can
//! be one the streamer is about to ask for again from ten yards away, and dropping it costs a
//! duplicate; a distance-expired entry is one whose tiles unloaded long ago. The radius is therefore
//! floored at the streamer's own reach ([`radius_floor`]) so eviction can never outrun the thing that
//! placed the art.
//!
//! **Two properties worth knowing before reading the code**, both of which buy the design its
//! smallness:
//!
//! 1. **Stamping needs no plumbing.** A *use* (a [`SpatialCache::fetch`] hit or an insert) clears the
//!    stamp to `None` — "used since the last sweep" — and the *sweep* is what writes today's focus
//!    onto every `None`. So no call site has to know where the camera is, and a cache nothing sweeps
//!    (the `Local<MaterialCache>`s in the glue booth and the portrait bake) simply never expires.
//! 2. **Nothing needs ordering.** The stamp is at worst one sweep interval stale (≈25 yd at flight
//!    speed, against a 2.6 km radius) and `due` being read a frame before it is set only moves the
//!    sweep one frame. There are no `.before`/`.after` constraints anywhere in this module.
//!
//! The failure mode if the radius were ever too small: evicting the dedup for art that is still
//! drawn. That is not a visual bug and not a leak — the drawn entity holds its own handles, and the
//! next spawn of that art re-creates one duplicate material which becomes the new cache entry. It
//! costs a lost batch, and it self-heals. That asymmetry (too-eager = mild and transient, too-lazy =
//! the bug we are fixing) is why the floor is a clamp and not a warning.
