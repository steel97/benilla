//! **[`WorldPlugins`] — the engine, as one name.**
//!
//! Decision 1160 splits the world renderer out of `benilla-app`; 1164 counted what a second
//! program has to name to use it and found **31 of the 214 items were plugin registrations** — one
//! per engine module, every one named by the composition root and by nothing else. That is not an
//! API, it is an assembly manual, and it made the engine's doorway look five times wider than the
//! engine's actual vocabulary. Published as a group, the whole set is one item and the members go
//! back to being internals.
//!
//! **The order below is load-bearing and is the client's own**, so the two binaries stay diffable
//! (it was `worldview::engine`, "the cut line written down", before it was this). Two edges inside
//! it are documented dependencies rather than taste: `WmoSkyPlugin` registers after `SkyPlugin`,
//! whose dome it stands down, and `PerfPlugin` after the debug panel, whose egui context it
//! needs (both instruments, and both the client's to add in that order now). `ArtScopePlugin` before `AssetPlugin` is *not* one — its own comment says so — but it
//! costs nothing to keep.
//!
//! **What is deliberately NOT here.** `pipe_warm` looks engine-adjacent and is not: the viewer
//! disproved it by running, grinding 1051 ms main-thread hitches warming the *game's* pipeline set
//! (nameplates, blob shadows, the UI quad lane, the portrait booths) for a frame that would never
//! be drawn. It is a client instrument and stays with the client.
//!
//! `debug_panel`, `perf` and the particle census are **not** here either, and the reason they once
//! had to be is worth keeping: the panel was the model-`Visibility` authority (the WMO portal PVS
//! is applied through it, decisions 0025/0031), so the world did not draw without it. That
//! authority is `model_render`'s now and the toggles it reads are `dev_state`'s, so the panel is an
//! instrument again — which is what 1160 wanted, instruments at the top of the stack rather than
//! the bottom. `art_scope` stays: within-map art residency is engine behaviour, not a readout, and
//! a viewer that never evicts is a viewer that measures the wrong thing.
//!
//! This is what makes `benilla-worldview` mean something. With the instruments out, the viewer is
//! the engine and nothing else, and every gameplay resource it still needs shows up as a stub.
