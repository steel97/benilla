//! **What you are standing on** — the `TerrainType` id under a unit's feet, for every consumer of
//! it (decision 1161).
//!
//! The reference keeps this as one cached dword per unit, `CGUnit+0xc60`: an environment-node
//! down-ray (`0x6a8a20`) resolves it on movement, and four readers consume that single value — the
//! `$FSD` footstep sound (`0x62341d`), the footprint decal (`0x5fc06e`), the footstep spray
//! (`0x5fc20f`) and `0x623749`. They cannot disagree about the ground, and neither can ours: this
//! module is the one place the question is answered.
//!
//! **Two legs, arbitrated by nearest hit.** The client races a terrain probe (`0x69c320`) against a
//! WMO probe (`0x6a8840`) over the building's COLLISION faces; whichever surface is nearer under
//! the foot supplies the type. That arbitration is already ours — it is the same faces-only,
//! terrain-raced down-ray that publishes [`UnitWmoRoom`], so a room claim *is* "the building won
//! this column".
//!
//! - **WMO leg.** The claim names a group; [`surface_terrain_sample`] re-casts the column over that
//!   group's RENDER faces and reads the hit face's `MOPY.material_id → MOMT+0x20` — a
//!   `TerrainType.dbc` id carried by the surface itself, with no `GroundEffectTexture` hop.
//! - **ADT leg.** No claim: the MCNK dominant layer → `GroundEffectTexture` → `TerrainType`, the
//!   chain that was already here.
//!
//! `None` is the client's `−1` sentinel and means **silent, and no print** — not "try the other
//! leg". A building that won the column but whose group has no render face under the probe is
//! silent; falling back to the ground beneath the floor is exactly the bug this module exists to
//! kill (B236's sequel: snow crunching inside the Kharanos inn, and snow prints on its floorboards,
//! because the ADT leg answered indoors).
//!
//! **Known gap — exterior groups.** Both the claim and the render-face set are built for INTERIOR
//! groups only, so a WMO surface authored on an *exterior* group (bridges and docks, `Wood`) still
//! falls to the ADT leg. Wrong in the same direction as before this module, never newly wrong; the
//! fix is widening the claim, not special-casing here.
