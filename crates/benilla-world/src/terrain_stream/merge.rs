//! **The production static-world consolidation, doodad lanes — ON by default** (1426;
//! `WOW_STATIC_MERGE=0` opts out. Design 1417, lane order re-ranked by 1418's density
//! verdict; the measured premise is 1413/1416's 44 ns/row tax).
//!
//! **Since 1434 this is the SECOND consolidator in line**: the retained pass
//! (`crate::static_gx`, also default-on) takes the static populations first at the same
//! assemble gate, and what reaches these accumulators under the defaults is its declined
//! families (env-mapped, depth-flagged batches) plus everything under `WOW_STATIC_GX=0`,
//! where this module is again the whole consolidation. The default flip deliberately
//! removed no code here — this lane IS the A/B arm every gx comparison diffs against.
//!
//! The assembler diverts every ADT-doodad batch that is fully static (the bracket's anim
//! exclusions), **order-free** (`Opaque`/`AlphaTest`, not additive: 0858's law that authored
//! draw order exists only on transparent-pass batches) and not an interior-slot prop, into
//! this buffer; the flush bakes each `(owner tile, 133⅓-yd cell, material)` group into ONE
//! mesh entity with placement transforms baked into the vertices. **The fader lane (lane 2)
//! is dev-opt-in only (`WOW_MERGE_FADERS=1`, decision 1423)**: each vertex carries its
//! placement's fade sphere ([`benilla_assets::ATTRIBUTE_WOW_FADE_SPHERE`]) and
//! `wow_model.wgsl`'s `WOW_MERGED_FADE` lane computes the faithful fade curve per vertex —
//! alpha in-shader, `Hidden` as a clip-space collapse at zero — on the BLEND TWIN permanently
//! (1420), the reference's own fading render state. The lane is correct per PIXEL but wrong
//! per PHASE: one transparent draw with one sort key spanning a cell of depths, depth-write
//! on, depth-kills per-entity faders behind its translucent pixels whenever the cell's sort
//! centre lands beyond them (the director's popping lamppost — 1422 shrank the class,
//! 1423 pulled the lane; the sort-near re-entry design is 1423's follow-up).
//!
//! The cell key preserves the frustum-cull locality the bracket's round 1 proved load-bearing
//! (+1.38 without it, −0.93 with); the owner tile buys the weld's whole lifetime story — the
//! blob lands in `TileState::merged` and despawns with its tile.
//!
//! **WMO group geometry never diverts (1418's verdict):** `batch_order` is a `MatKey` axis, so
//! every WMO batch already owns a unique material handle — under the correct
//! `(uid, group, material)` key the measured merge is EXACTLY 1:1, zero rows saved. The WMO
//! share of the frame belongs to option B's cross-material retained draw, not to any
//! entity-level lane. [`MergeSite::Wmo`] survives only to feed the census predictor.
//!
//! The close rule is the weld's (1369), not the bracket's wall clock: vertex cap + idle-frame
//! tail — [`MERGE_IDLE_FRAMES`] (a quarter second) in settled play, ONE quiet frame under the
//! arrival cover, where the settle release waits on the backlog (`merge_pending` is a
//! `presentable()` term) and a fixed tail would push every world entry longer for nothing.
//! Play-streaming then RE-CONSOLIDATES: distance admission trickles a cell's doodads in over
//! the whole approach, gapped in seconds, so in-play closes shred a cell into fragments
//! (Goldshire: 214/445 singleton blobs — 1421's census; its "1-frame tail" attribution was a
//! misread, the in-play tail was already ¼ s and no sane tail bridges an approach). Fragments
//! spawn fast — appearance latency is the tail's job — and once a cell's key has been quiet
//! for [`RECONSOLIDATE_IDLE_FRAMES`] its fragments re-bake into one blob per vertex cap and
//! the originals retire after an upload cushion ([`RETIRE_FRAMES`]).
//! Dead-owner accumulators are discarded, and the whole buffer clears on map drop for the same
//! tile-keys-repeat-across-maps reason the weld's does.
//!
//! The straddler gap (1417's lifecycle §) is CLOSED: when an owner tile unloads out from under
//! a placement a loaded neighbour still references, `handoff_straddlers` (terrain_stream.rs)
//! re-owns the placement to that referrer and queues a respawn, so its batches re-divert here
//! under the new owner — and its hulls re-weld, closing 1369's matching collider gap whenever
//! the merge is on.
