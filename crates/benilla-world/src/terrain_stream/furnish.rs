//! Paced per-cell tile furnishing — the fix for B181's *first-contact* spike (decision 0832).
//!
//! A landed tile's ~256 MCNK cell meshes used to arrive as loader-built sub-assets: the whole
//! set (and, decodes bunching, usually the whole 5-tile row's ~1300) hit the render world's
//! extract/prepare/upload in ONE frame — 80–105 ms of process CPU at the Emerald Dream pin,
//! 120–240 ms at Undercity, on every first crossing of a tile line. No budget downstream of the
//! loader could spread work the loader had already packaged, so the build moved here: each cell's
//! mesh is made from the decoded [`AdtTile::chunks`] + [`AdtTile::shading`]
//! ([`benilla_assets::chunk_to_mesh`]), a bounded number per frame while live, nearest tile
//! first. Mesh-asset creation is the pacing point; everything downstream follows its rate.
//!
//! While the body is **not** live (entry, teleport, world-stale) the cap is off: the loading
//! screen exists to absorb exactly that burst, and the residency the settle release reads counts
//! *furnished* tiles, so the cover never lifts onto bare ground.
