//! **The residency window** — how far around the view focus terrain is kept resident, derived
//! from `farclip` exactly as the reference derives it (decision 1513).
//!
//! The reference has one view-distance setting, the `farclip` CVar (the Video Options "Terrain
//! Distance" slider, 177..777), and streams *from* it: `SetFarClip 0x6725d0` computes
//! `r = 1 + trunc(farclip / 33.333)` **chunks** once, and the per-frame world tick (`0x672730`)
//! centres two nested square windows on the viewer's chunk — the **inner** `idx ± r` (terrain that
//! must be resident: the farclip disc rounded out to whole chunks) and the **outer**
//! `idx ± max(r + 2, 8)` (requested ahead, built under a 5 ms/frame budget; the 8-chunk floor is
//! 266⅔ yd). Eviction is pure membership in the outer window, at tile granularity (`[area+0x88]`
//! vs `bounds >> 4`). Every number here is VERIFIED at the bytes — wow-re `terrain.md`,
//! "Streaming residency", and `scratch/streaming-residency-and-forced-load.md` §1–§2.
//!
//! Two deliberate differences from the reference, both named in 1513:
//! - **Whole tiles.** benilla loads, spawns and releases ADT tiles, not chunks; a tile is wanted iff
//!   any of its chunks lies in the outer window. The reference builds chunk-by-chunk inside the
//!   same windows, so the edge of its resident world is a chunk line and ours is a tile line.
//! - **A one-chunk keep band** ([`KEEP_BAND_CHUNKS`]). The reference releases by membership alone
//!   because its reload is a cheap async read; ours re-decodes and re-spawns a tile (B181's
//!   frame spike), so a tile is wanted inside `outer` and released only past `outer + 1` —
//!   hysteresis against a body pacing across the one chunk line that toggles a far tile.
