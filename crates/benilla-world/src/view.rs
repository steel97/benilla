//! **The view** — who is looking, with what optics, and how far the detailed world is drawn.
//!
//! Three things, one owner. [`WorldCamera`] marks *the* camera the scene is rendered through;
//! [`CAM_NEAR`] and [`CAM_FOVY`] are its optics; [`ViewDistance`] is the faithful `farclip`.
//!
//! The marker and the optics were in `player::camera` until decision 1160's stage zero, and that
//! was the single largest edge across the engine/game line: **26 engine files** — terrain
//! streaming, the portal PVS, sun follow, picking, every effect sim — reached into the *player
//! controller* to ask which camera to read. None of them care about a player; they care about the
//! viewer, which a world editor and a serverless viewer have without one. `farclip` itself was
//! promoted out of the debug panel earlier, for the same reason at a smaller scale: it was a
//! `ModelDebug` field doing double duty, so it read as a debug knob rather than as config, and
//! subsystems each kept their own idea of it.
//!
//! Read by: the hard far-clip **wall** (terrain/model/liquid/WDL/particle shaders, pushed as
//! `fog_params.w` by `lighting::apply_wow_lighting`), the per-object **cull**
//! (`model_render::apply_model_visibility`), the particle **draw-set gate**
//! (`particles::sim::simulate_particles`) — both through [`within_farclip`] — and the terrain
//! **residency window** (`terrain_stream::window`), which derives its reach from `farclip` the way
//! the reference does (decision 1513). The player's lever is the Terrain Distance row of the
//! options window (the `farclip` CVar); `$WOW_FARCLIP` is the headless one.
