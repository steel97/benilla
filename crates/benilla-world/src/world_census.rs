//! **[`WorldCensus`] — what the engine drew this frame, published as a fact.**
//!
//! Every number an instrument wants about a rendered frame — how many submeshes exist, how many
//! survived to `ViewVisibility`, which subsystem each belongs to, what the exterior-scene gate did,
//! how many emitters are alive, what the asset caches are holding, what got rewritten since the
//! last frame — is a fact the *renderer* owns. Before this module the probes read it by querying
//! the renderer's own components and resources directly, and that one file
//! (`capture/probes/live_fps.rs`) named nine engine internals nobody else outside the engine
//! needed: four material aliases, the two exterior-cull types, the two portal types, and the
//! camera's interior claim. Decision 1164 sorts all nine into CLOSE with the same remedy —
//! *publish the census, not the components* — and this is that census.
//!
//! It is one read-only [`SystemParam`] and one snapshot type. An instrument adds the param, calls
//! [`WorldCensus::take`] on the frame it cares about, and formats the snapshot however its own
//! output contract wants. **No `println!` lives here**: the line shapes (`VIS_CENSUS`,
//! `MAT_CHURN`, `ASSET_DUMP`) are the probes' greppable contract, not the engine's, and an engine
//! that formats its callers' output has the boundary backwards.
//!
//! The one part that is opt-in is the churn window: counting `AssetEvent::Modified` per asset type
//! costs a `MessageReader` per type per frame, so [`WorldCensus::churn_counters`] installs them
//! and an ordinary run carries none. **Which** types are counted is engine knowledge (it is the
//! engine's material set); **whether** to count is the instrument's call.
