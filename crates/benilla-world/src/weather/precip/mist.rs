//! The companion mist — every precip type owns one in the reference (its own object: ctor
//! `0x67a5b0`, spawn `0x67a990`, render `0x67ae20`; rain/snow texture `SnowMist01.blp`, sand
//! `WeatherMistGrainy01.blp`). Spawn law: wow-re's **difftested** `mist.rs` transcription;
//! lifetime/motion/fade semantics: the §5 ten-agent finding
//! `system/lighting/scratch/rf-weather-mist-motion.md` (byte-arbitrated) — every constant here
//! is now VERIFIED.
//!
//! The mechanism: up to 128 puffs, spawned at `2·max(density−0.5, 0)·K·Q` nodes/s (zero below
//! the density knee), each born from draws in the **wind-heading frame** — a polar motion
//! basis `dir` (per-type radius, azimuth −1.57±0.175, a gentle rise) and a box scatter
//! (±22 × ±22 × ±12.5, ctor args stored verbatim) — placed `1.5·dir` upstream of the camera
//! with `z = max(ground, seeded z) + 6`. Nodes live **2.7 ± 0.15 s** (the 1024 Hz weather
//! clock), stream at `pos += dt·dir` (≈5 yd/s rain, ≈9 snow) plus a small isotropic
//! `0.5·dt²·tail` rise-assist, and fade over **0.4 s** ramps to **full opacity** — a churning
//! VOLUME of fog-coloured 12×12 quads through the camera's height band. (The *constant near
//! haze* of reference rain is NOT these puffs — they are invisible within 6 yd — it is the
