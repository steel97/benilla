//! Precipitation — the pooled rain/snow simulation, its ground layers, and the mist companion.
//! Spawn kinematics from wow-re's byte-exact transcriptions (`crates/lighting/src/
//! wx_rainspawn.rs`, `wx_snowspawn.rs`, `weather_init.rs`, `wx_leaf_fp.rs`, `weather_scalars.rs`);
//! render laws from the §5 finding `system/lighting/scratch/rf-weather-render.md` (the
//! render-law fold-back record). Implemented idiomatically (f32 math, Bevy space) — the *laws*
//! (constants, rates, gates, blend states) are the reference's, the x87 quirks are not.
//!
//! The verified structure:
//! - **Placement** is one law for both kinds ([`pool::spawn_particle`], wow-re
//!   `wx-snow-placement-law.md`): `pos = R·(O − T·V) + 1.75·W + C`. The scatter `O` lies on the
//!   plane the particle *arrives* on; `−T·V` back-projects it up its own velocity; **`R` leans the
//!   whole slab into the direction of travel** by `65°·sat(speed/18)`; then the wind lead and the
//!   live camera eye. `R` was missing until decision 1159 and its absence IS B233's second half —
//!   without it a particle needs its entire fall to reach eye height, which a running player
//!   outpaces (snow at grade 0.6: 7.8 s of fall against 54 yd of running, versus a 45 yd box).
//! - **Rain**: drops scatter across 130×130 yd, `T = −37.5/Vz` (`0x674df6–e53`;
//!   rf-weather-emission-timeline Q5 — the old "spawns AT eye height" read killed only the box's
//!   z-RANDOM, not the constant lift, and made density camera-angle-dependent). Each drop dies
//!   at the **terrain** under its spawn column and leaves a 0.25 s *patter* splash **1:1** (calm
//!   wind only). Streaks draw as fixed-size comet-tail TRIANGLES (0.1 wide × 2.0 long) with
//!   **no vertex colour** — the look is `RainDrop01.blp` (authored grey-128-neutral) under
//!   **Mod2x** (`2·src·dst`) and a **forced grey fog** over 70..75 yd that IS the distance fade.
//! - **Snow**: same rails, 90×90 box, slab lift +30, slow wandering kinematics — but a
//!   completely different DRAW. The leg that runs is the ARB **point sprite** `0x678610`
//!   (`glDrawArrays(GL_POINTS)`, `snowpoint.bls`), so a flake is sized in **pixels**,
//!   `max(1, 14·clamp01(1 − 0.02·d))` — denominated in the ERA's screen height so the angle, not
//!   the pixel count, carries to a modern display ([`SNOW_PX_REF_HEIGHT`], decision 1162) — with
//!   alpha `clamp01(t − f1)` falling (a 1 s fade-in) and
//!   `clamp01(1 − 4·(t − f2))` settled. Blend mode 2 (SrcAlpha, 1−SrcAlpha), fog OFF,
//!   depth-write off, RGB white. The `1/12` world-space triangle of `0x678960` is the
//!   fixed-function FALLBACK and never runs on real hardware — benilla drew it (as a *quad*,
//!   times an invented size jitter) while taking the shader leg's population, which is B233's
//!   "flakes seem too big" (decision 1149; wow-re `rf-snow-flake-render.md`).
//! - **Mist**: every precip type carries a companion mist — its own object in the reference
//!   (ctor `0x67a5b0`, spawn `0x67a990`, render `0x67ae20`); the law lives in [`mist`].
//! - Ground heights come from a **lazy height cache** of the reference's weather ground
//!   oracle (`0x67c760 → mgr+0x34 → 0x6b7070`): **WMO/doodad-AWARE** (round 3 Q-B, refuting
//!   the round-2 "terrain-only" read) — after the terrain sample it probes the chunk's static
//!   object refs and MAXes the hit (`CMapObj::IntersectSegment 0x6a37b0`, `0x6b7237–4a`), so
//!   drops **land on roofs**: splashes on the inn roof, never inside, from any camera.
//!   Independently, "no weather indoors" is the global weather-visible flag (`[0xca80c4]`) —
//!   it kills the DRAW alone (`0x677380`/`0x6790b0`/`0x67a520`; simulation always runs — round-6
//!   Q-H(b)); force-set with the camera outdoors (`0x6811d4`), and set from inside whenever an
//!   exterior group survives the view-clipped portal-window pass (`0x6b42d9`) — rain shows
//!   through a doorway the camera can SEE. See [`gate_weather_indoors`].
//! - **Drift heading is WORLD-FIXED**: both spawn kernels centre the per-drop horizontal drift
//!   on the constant azimuth −1.57 rad (`0x80ffbc`, R3/R3a) with a grade-scaled spread. The
//!   **wind** — the local PLAYER's trailing-149-ms average velocity (`0x67c150`, a true yd/s
//!   vector; the camera orbiting does not stir it) — enters ONLY through the spawn-box lead
//!   (×1.75) and the streak APEX tilt (`lerp(0°, 45°, sat(|wind|/30))`, verified DOWNWIND) —
//!   never the drift heading. (R10's spawn-plane tilt keys on the zone-ambient wind, which
//!   benilla doesn't model yet; the patter gate keys on ridden-transport velocity — no gate on
//!   foot.)
//!
//! - **The packet pipeline** (rf-weather-emission-timeline, rounds 2–3): drops are RECORDED
//!   into an open packet, which renders NOTHING until it seals (shader legs draw only the
//!   close-baked buffer) and its `baseTime = open + 6144/rate` stamp passes — a delay line
//!   that hides an upswing's sparse early drizzle (first visible rain stochastic, mostly
//!   ~8.5–14 s, AFTER the fog and mist) and lets committed rain persist through a same-type
//!   clear-down. A wire TYPE change instead cuts: emission stops at once and the unreplayed
//!   pipeline is discarded (`pool::Pool::cut`). A packet is also **retired outright** once its
//!   open-time camera anchor falls further than [`RETIRE_DIST`] from the live eye
//!   (`pool::Pool::retire_far`) — the teleport guard, which is why a `.go` no longer strands the
//!   field at the position you left. See `pool` and [`SHADER_LEG`].
//!
//! Geometry is pushed per frame from the live pools onto the shared effect stream (0733):
//! rain's Mod2x blend + forced fog are the lane's `EffectBlend::Mod2x` + `EffectFog::Rain`
//! variants; snow and mist ride the Alpha/fog-off rows. Idle pools push nothing — the
//! structural replacement for the old fixed-capacity meshes' write gate (the 0353 fps hunt).

/// and the field ran ~11% thin. Sized here off that measured worst case with headroom.
///
/// **Those demand figures predate 1165's halving** and are kept because they are what was
