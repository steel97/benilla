/// collapsing to 0 while running before the spawn-slab tilt and holding ~2115 after it.
///
/// **`centroid` is a weak second, and is easy to misread — it was, once.** Two biases sit on it:
/// the drift heading is a fixed WORLD azimuth, so even a standing field's centroid sits
/// `drift · mean_age` off along it (−5.5 yd at wire grade 0.6, −14 at 1.0, depending on which way
/// the player faces); and it is *count-weighted*, so long-lived particles born high and to the rear
/// dominate it. Under the slab tilt those two effects nearly cancel the forward shift at low grade:
/// a Monte-Carlo of [`super::pool::spawn_particle`] predicts the running centroid improving only 9% at grade 0.6
/// against 49% at 1.0, and the live client measured 11% and 61% — agreeing with the law while
/// looking, on the centroid alone, like the fix had barely worked. Never conclude from it alone.
///
/// `frames` is the count since the previous census, and it is **not decoration**: `run_kind`'s
/// budget is `rate · min(dt, 1/60)` with the remainder dropped, so emission per second scales with
/// frame rate and a sub-60 fps leg measures a genuinely thinner field than a 60 fps one on
/// identical code. Two census lines are only comparable at equal `frames` — measured, the field
/// tracks `fps/60` and nothing else: 1542/2115 = 72.9% and 1598/2134 = 74.9% against frame-rate
/// ratios of 71.8% and 73.0%. (An earlier revision of this line claimed 48%, which was an
/// arithmetic slip on my part; it read as an unexplained anomaly and cost a wasted RE question.)
