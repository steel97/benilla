//! **The rider lane** (decision 1609): an attached model — a helm, a pauldron, a held weapon, a
//! shield — placed by a palette frame measured in its WEARER's rig frame, so its position is
//! never an absolute f32 world coordinate that gets recomputed every frame.
//!
//! ## Why an attached model needs its own lane at all
//!
//! Decision 0974 moved the model lane camera-relative: a rig's palette rows are composed with the
//! root's translation zeroed, the row's world position rides a per-slot `rig_origin`, and the
//! vertex stage adds it back as `frame·v + (origin − camera)`. A standing unit's origin is
//! **constant**, so its body is exact — the one f32 rounding left in it never moves.
//!
//! Its attachments were not. They are ordinary scene-graph entities: the attach anchor's
//! `GlobalTransform` is `joints_root_world × bone_local`, a ~1-yard quantity added to a ~9500-yard
//! one, recomputed every frame. WoW's coordinates run to ±17066 yd and an f32 in `[8192, 16384)`
//! has an ULP of exactly `2⁻¹⁰ yd = 0.9766 mm`, so the sum lands on a 0.98 mm grid **on the large
//! axis** while the bone under it moves smoothly across it. The rendered helm therefore holds
//! still for a few frames and then snaps one whole ULP sideways, for ever, while the body it sits
//! on moves exactly. Measured on the Goldshire Stormwind Guard (`WOW_JITTER`, 2698 frames): the
//! anchors' per-frame Δ along that axis was **exactly 0 or exactly one ULP and nothing between**
//! (1835 / 839 frames), their second difference was exactly one ULP on 53 % of frames, and the
//! body bones' was 0.0094 mm — a factor of 104. At the reported close-up that is 0.83 px of hop
//! every other frame on the helm, both pauldrons, the sword and the shield. 0974 named this
//! residual and did not take it; this is taking it.
//!
//! ## The mechanism
//!
//! An attached model rests at **bind pose** — the item lane arms no `AnimationPlayer` and no
//! global-sequence drive, which is why it draws a static mesh today. At bind pose every palette
//! row of it is the *same* matrix: a row is `world_from_joint × inverse_bindpose`, and
//! `world_from_joint = F × bind_model_j` with `inverse_bindpose_j = bind_model_j⁻¹`, so every row
//! collapses to the placement `F` itself. So the whole model needs **one frame**, written into
//! each of its rows, and the picture it draws is identical to the static mesh's — the change is
//! precision and nothing else.
//!
//! And `F` is available exactly: `F = host_basis × pose.model[bone] × T(offset)`, where
//! `host_basis` is the host's own frame with its translation zeroed — the same rig-relative basis
//! 0974 composes the body in. Every factor is rig-sized, so `F` costs ~1e-7 yd, and the slot's
//! `rig_origin` carries the host's world position through to the vertex stage, where it is added
//! camera-relative. Nothing on the path is ever a big-plus-small sum.
//!
//! **The entity keeps its absolute `GlobalTransform`.** That is the whole reason this is a
//! *palette* lane and not a rebase of the scene graph: collision, picking, the item glow, the
//! bowstring and the booth mirrors all read an attached model's world position and all keep
//! reading exactly what they read before. Only the rendered vertices change route.
//!
//! **Named residuals** (they keep the absolute route, and the staircase with it): billboard cards
//! (spawned at world root by decision 0153), item glow instances (children of the item root with
//! their own attachment offsets), the engine-drawn bowstring/fishing line, and the seven
//! `welds_billboard` displays whose 0841/0854 joint rig is camera-replaced per frame and so is not
//! a bind-pose rigid frame.
